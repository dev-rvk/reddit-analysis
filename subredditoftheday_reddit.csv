September 2nd, 2012 - /r/gallifreyan - Hello, Sweetie

## r/gallifreyan

735 Timelords scribing for 4 months

----

For those of you who didn't know, it was recently the Doctor Who season premiere.  I happen to be a big Whovian.  As a result, it gives me great pleasure to introduce /r/gallifreyan, a writing system based on the gallifreyan language in Doctor Who.  I wanted to write up an incredibly nifty introduction for this, but the interview became too long.  I'll just get right into the good stuff and let the two mods (/u/pcjonathan and /u/DevilChicken), along with a special guest,   /u/TheInventor, explain everything.  Don't worry - no spoilers.

----

>Fantastic! What's the history of Circular Gallifreyan?

>>**pcjonathan**:  Well...the language (or ""code"" would be a better way of describing it) didn't start till very recently. It has a fairly long history as a whole but in short:
>>In the TV Show Doctor Who, you have a race, Gallifreyans (some are Time Lords), who live on Gallifrey. They have 3 types of language. Old High Gallifreyan, Modern High Gallifreyan and Circular Gallifreyan. All these have featured throughout the series but never have had the same style that can be translated or used, etc. See more on this [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Gallifreyan_(language\)).

>>I'm not entirely sure about the exact history of Sherman's version of it behind the scenes, but from my POV, I saw this new thing pop up and I thought...Wow that's complex. I could never do that. And at the time, I just didn't have the time to learn how to do it. So many weeks past and it got more and more popular and I started seeing it submitted to /r/DoctorWho a lot. I began to learn it slowly, still lacking on time. It was at this point in time where I saw loads of posts swarming the /r/DoctorWho subreddit where I gave /u/DevilChicken the idea of creating a subreddit for it. (Yes...Mr Chicken...I will keep a hold of that and Yes...I will call you Mr Chicken) to start one. I felt like doing it myself, sure, but at the time I was doing exams and had to unexpectedly take over being the Admin of Combom and still had to deal with other things so I couldn't.  A month later, when things calmed down, I decided to join and to start planning on making things even better! :)

>>**TheInventor**:  In terms of the fanmade script, it didn't start out as Circular Gallifreyan at all. It was simply a neat alphabet that I had invented. I wrote a few words in it for some friends, and they wanted to know how to write it as well, so I posted a rudimentary guide animation to my website. When it came to naming the alphabet, someone noted that it resembled the Circular Gallifreyan from Doctor Who. I modified the script and called it ""Gallifreyan"" and somehow the link must have gotten passed around because next thing I knew my website had been crashed by hordes of rampaging Doctor Who fans. Once I recovered from the initial shock and got my site back up, I devoted a section of it to the alphabet and wrote up a more official guide. I also started work on a translator, although that remains unfinished due to schoolwork. Since then, my work has been promoted on deviantART, tumblr, wikidot, and of course, reddit. It has grown to fantastic proportions, far beyond what I ever imagined it would.

>>**DevilChicken**:   Well, the method the we use was made one day by Sherman for...something. The language itself was originally made on the show Doctor Who, but there was no discernible pattern to be picked up.

>What makes it so awesome to learn? Can a non-Whovian learn it?

>>**pcjonathan**:  Ooh..That's a toughie. The greatest appeal it would be is for Whovians out there as it is, after all, based off Doctor Who. But you don't need to be a Whovian to learn it. It's just as easy either way. It's pretty much a cool way of putting English. Some people do have problems with it though, but that's what the subreddit is for! The only problem for non-Whovians would be, there's a tad less of an ""Epic"" feel to it and most of the quotes we use are from Doctor Who (Such as the ""He's like fire and Ice..."" speech) so you may miss out a little. Most people like doing Doctor Who related things with it. So watch Doctor Who too!

>>**TheInventor**:  Being the teacher and not the learner, I can only quote someone else on this: ""When I write I don’t see letters, I don’t see circles and lines. I don’t even see the quotes or phrases. I see the cosmos, I see stars and gas giants. I see planets and moons and rings. I see the totality of art and language and mathematics combined into a form that sings to all of my faculties. When I write I am scribing the universe."" They, in turn, go on to quote Doctor Who: “There were days, there were many days, where these words could burn stars, raise up empires, and topple gods.”

>>**DevilChicken**:  This language is awesome to learn because it is genuinely fun to write in. I have a good time and it is very relaxing. Anybody could learn CG, it is not very difficult at all.

>What would you like to see more of in /r/gallifreyan as a subreddit?

>>**pcjonathan**:  Little more activity. But that's a little calling the kettle black lately if I am being honest. It seems to come in waves. I tell you one thing that would be great...and that is a CSS expert to say hello. Unfortunately, Mr Chicken isn't that great with it and I can only do so much looking and ""borrowing"" from others without understanding it perfectly myself. But besides from that, I find it fantastic how self-sustaining the subreddit is. We don't get any spam or abuse or anything like that. All the users tend to help each other out. It's very self-sustaining. They're fantastic!

>>**TheInventor**:  I'd have to agree, activity. Tumblr in particular is producing Gallifreyan artwork faster than I can view it, so I know that people are capable of it. But I think that the subreddit's unique strength is in its supportive community- I say as much in the latter portions of my guide, as well as recommending that people post their inquiries in the subreddit.

>>**DevilChicken**:  It would be great if the community was a bit more active, we currently have new content being submitted every day, which still blows me away, and I suppose that I should be doing a better job of pumping blood into it if I want it to work as a whole, but...minecraft.

>Have you seen gallifreyan work with other languages besides English?

>>**pcjonathan**:  Haha. Actually. Yes. Once. In Latin. It's this one I believe. As I only know English (that's a whole story in itself), I didn't really bother to translate it. After all, I had no idea what it was supposed to be, or even any words of it. And when the author doesn't put what it's supposed to be, there's not much else I can do.
The downside of trying to do a foreign language is that many of the letters are impossible to do. Hell, we can't do C in our own language (it's replaced by S or K).

>>**TheInventor**:  I've seen a piece or two in Latin, but other than that nothing. Putting symbols such as umlauts and tildes in the alphabet is on the to-do list.

>>**DevilChicken**:  I have not, but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be able to. Some languages do have symbols that aren't in CG, like the tilde over the N in Spanish, or the umlaut(?) over vowels in German.

>Is there any gallifreyan art work there? It seems like this writing is practically art in itself. This should give you an idea, though.

>>**pcjonathan**:  There's plenty of Gallifreyan work out there. The entire subreddit is full of it. Ranging from a beginners ""Am I doing this right?"" to Mr Chickens own ""[The Pride of my works](http://i.imgur.com/wgKLP.jpg)"".

>>**TheInventor**:  I consider all Gallifreyan to be artwork, but some people have come up with very creative adaptations and stylized techniques that are quite strikingly beautiful. Everyone has their own handwriting, and their own style that becomes apparent as they write more and more. There is so much room for artistic expression in Gallifreyan that no two people write it quite the same.

>>**DevilChicken**:  Yeah, I've seen some really great pieces that I would call art. It all ranges, people can write in really fancy normal letters and call it art, but that's more calligraphy than anything. So I suppose that fancy CG would be calligraphic.

The interview was too long, so the remainder [will be in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/z827c/september_2nd_2012_rgallifreyan_hello_sweetie/c629vbh).

Do you often get into squabbles you can't resolve with words? Do you get into awkward social situations and need to escape instantly? Do you live near a beach? Well help is here with Dale Gribble's revolutionary defence mechanism, *Pocketsand!* Pocketsand has a new and improved formula for your pocket that increases blindness to bad guys, increases hand-to-sand co-ordination and increased mental and sexual stamina. All these great perks of *Pocketsand* are topped off with the delightful smell of the sea-side right there in your front (or back) pocket.

I hear what you're saying, ""Hey /u/mrdoink20, can you even back up these claims with proof?"". Well, I say to that. [***Pocketsand!***](http://31.media.tumblr.com/94e8994bd828a9c0f4160bbc273d53af/tumblr_mpk1kxSa6b1rj00g6o1_500.gif) and I'm already half way to Mexico. My brain full of claims and my pocket full of broken rocks and shells. Life is good when you have *Pocketsand*.

So are you ready to take the sandiest ride of your life? Are you ready to put your responsibilities on hold and cover them in sand? Will you throw sand in the face of adversity and yell ""SH-SHAAAAAA!""? Well **prove** it and get your *Pocketsand* today. Still aren't convinced? Well don't take my word for it, here's what the guys over at /r/pocketsand had to say:

>##1. What is /r/pocketsand about?

>> **tofumac** Pocketsand is about non-lethal short range temporary incapacitation for the betterment of society.

>> **duisnipe** /r/pocketsand is about spreading awareness of an effective, non-lethal form of concealable self defense. The subreddit also discusses tactics, different sands, pockets, and stories relating to pocket sand.

>##2. For those who don't know, where did /r/pocketsand originate?

>> **tofumac** Pocketsand originated long ago but was popularized by Dale Gribble from King of the Hill and Burton Guster from Psyche.

>> **duisnipe** I'll expand upon what tofumac said; the earliest recorded pocket sanders where samurai. At the time it was called ""Metsubushi"" and the sand was placed into a hollowed out egg and often accompanied by glass.

>##3. What is your favourite use of pocket sand?

>> **tofumac** My favorite is good ole classic pocket sanding to the eyes, remember aim high it doesn't go as far as you think.

>> **duisnipe** Escape, confusion, and to look cool.

>##4. Have you managed to use pocket sand strategies in real life?
   
>> **tofumac** I once found myself cornered by an unsavory character after yelling at him to shut up. He was yelling at his girlfriend in front of the grocery store, and after I spoke up he ran at me. Without hesitation I deftly reached into my pocket and had the sand in his eyes faster than you can say Shh-Shhaaaa.

>> **duisnipe** I cannot answer this question under my lawyer's advice. I'll say this much: I hope we don't go to trial.

>##5. Would you like to say anything to your Subscribers?

>> **tofumac** I have to thank the r/pocketsand community. Many of them have much more pocketsanding experience than me. Their stories are incredible and insighful, I empty my pockets to them all.

>> **duisnipe** I thank every member of the /r/pocketsand community. While I know many may guffaw and underestimate our ways I encourage you to stay positive and remember you've got a few things they don't. A few thousand things. In your pocket. And soon in their eyes.

Thanks for reading and order your pocket sand today! Thanks to /r/pocketsand for inviting me. 

Lots of love, Doink x",1630001526.0,2021-08-26 20:12:06

Alright then. I told you in the title not to read this post if you are offended easily. I should have added that you shouldn’t visit this sub if your sensibilities are exceptionally delicate. If you are on the fence wondering about whether or not this means you, reflect a bit. This is a test of your self awareness system. Do you think the human body is beautiful? I do. Do you like cute little costumes? Yes. Yes please. Has it ever crossed your mind that penises should be displayed, dressed up, and shown off? Well, you are in luck. There is a subreddit for wonderful people like you. A few months ago, before my life became nothing but divorce paperwork, moving, and crying in the corner, I interviewed one of the amazing mods of r/cospenis and it was pretty fun. In retrospect, I probably should have asked more questions, but I was too busy looking at penises dressed in tiny costumes. I hope you enjoy learning about this fun sub or, if you are one of the few redditors who doesn’t enjoy a well-thought-out dick pic, I hope that you avoid this sub *at all costs*.

**PK:** What is your favorite thing about cospenis?

>**M:** What I like best about the sub is how perfectly silly it is.
When people say ""boys will be boys"", this is what that should mean. It shouldn't mean that all kinds of horrid behaviour can be waved away, but that men will always be playful and silly.

[This easter egg post for example, I think that's just neat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cospenis/comments/mk5wrr/congratulations_you_found_the_last_easter_egg/) 

**PK:** What are your plans for the sub going forward? 

>**M:** We'd just like to keep it ticking along as it has been, really.

**PK:** Is there anything that someone who is unfamiliar with the sub should know about it?

>**M:** People unfamiliar with the sub might think it's porn. It's not. It's NSFW, obviously, but it's also just a bit of fun and intended to be not overtly tittilating.

**PK:** Do you remove overly pornographic submissions, or just let the penises come in organically?

>**M:** If it's really just porn then I treat it as spam and remove.

**PK:** Cool beans. I love what you guys have going on here. Thanks for facilitating such an awesome way to celebrate the glory of male genitalia. 

Happy Redditing!

**2990** *ruck-fillers* for **7 years!**

\*\*\*\*\*

*I recently interviewed the legendary* u/Ser_SinAlot *from* r/rucking *about life, COVID, blisters, heavy weights, rucksacks, safety, and long walks carrying heavy loads. I hope you all enjoy!*

\*\*\*\*\*

*Greetings and salutations exchanged*

**princesskeestrr**: Lol, I hope that you knocked on a lot of wood. So, how has having COVID impacted your rucking hobby?

**SerSinAlot**: Well, I can't go out until next week. Then I'll start slow and work back up to usual.

**princesskeestrr**: What is your usual?

**SerSinAlot**: I usually run or ruck about 20-25km a week Adding in the occasional longer ruck or run

**princesskeestrr**: That is impressive. I actually fell into rucking accidentally myself. It started when I wanted to make my backyard less boring and I would hike down to our local creek, fill a backpack full of river rock, and haul it home. Then, either you or one of the other guys on your mod team joined / wellnessover 30 where I used to mod and I was like ""wow, I exercise!"" But it's only like half a mile each way.

**SerSinAlot**: That's one way to ruck.

**princesskeestrr**: I mean, it's close, right? Tell me how to do it right.

**SerSinAlot**: Rucking is just a military acronym from ruck marching Ruck is backpack and marching is walking. That's it.

**princesskeestrr**: I like the simplicity

**SerSinAlot**: Of course if you want fitness benefits you need to do longer rucks, but hey to each their own That's one the reasons people seem to come to our sub now. The bar of entry is so low and people usually have a backpack at home. No need for specialized gear to begin with

**princesskeestrr**: I have found that what I am doing works wonders for my lower back pain. How much weight do you typically add to your ruck?

**SerSinAlot**: It does. Carrying things on your back does wonders. I have about 10kg base weight. Then add water or whatever else I have. Most military rucks over here have the 10kg minimum, so that's what I train with

**princesskeestrr**:  Yes, hydration is key. *Shout out to my* r/hydrohomies

**SerSinAlot**: That's one thing that easily is overlooked. While rucking you don't get as thirsty as say running Yet after a few hours you really feel it if you haven't been drinking. My rule is a gulp every km or so.

**princesskeestrr**: That has been my observation as well, am more likely to forget to drink than when I am playing soccer or something. Good rule, I like that.

**SerSinAlot**: When I do long>40km I also have a bag of mixed nuts and fruit. A handful every so often keeps the energy levels up Especially on multidays like Vierdaagse, you need to keep hydrated and energy supplied throughout the days

**princesskeestrr**: So, is that like a rucking event? Are there rucking events?!

**SerSinAlot**: Vierdgaagse is the biggest walking event in the world. There's like 40 something thousand participants Civilian series are 30k and 50k a day. Military is 40k with service uniform and min. 10kg ruck.

**princesskeestrr**: Well now I'm getting excited.

**SerSinAlot**: It's a huge thing in Holland. If you want to see something fun check out Blister of the day on facebook. They have some nice material.

**princesskeestr**: will do this, despite my reluctance to go on Facebook

**SerSinAlot**: I'm not on there neither, but I hear they post them there

**princesskeestrr**: Is that a group or a page?

**SerSinAlot**: They tag it blister of the day or something. [Found it](https://www.facebook.com/pg/KampHeumehsoord/photos/?tab=album&album_id=822987297837378)

**princesskeestrr**: Wow, that is graphic.

**SerSinAlot**: Yeah, that's Vierdaagse. One of the things about rucking long distances is taking care of your feet.

**princesskeestrr**: How do you take care of your feet?

**SerSinAlot**: That's one of the things I'd like to work on the sub. Get us a wiki with information on how to keep your feet healthy.

**princesskeestrr**: That would be amazing.

**SerSinAlot**: On march, pop+tape

**princesskeestrr**: My friend's wife just got a ton of blisters while hiking and she is super grouchy. They are fighting a lot as a result. Very unhealthy for their marriage.

**SerSinAlot**: My IFAK on march has needle, tape, disinfectant and lamb's wool. At home some second skin is adequate. On march, second skin just destroys your feet more. It is so thick, that it only hurts

**princesskeestrr**: Wow

**SerSinAlot**: I learned that in Vierdaagse, the painful way. Lambs wool is used when you get a blister between the toes. Pop tape and wrap lambs wool around the toe Prevents chafing

**princesskeestrr**: This may be a stupid question, so please excuse me, but do you carry a ruck during Vierdaagse? Does everyone else?

**SerSinAlot**: day & S Military series. Mandatory. Don't worry. There are no stupid questions. I attend as part of the Finnish delegation.

**princesskeestrr**: Cool

**SerSinAlot**: Civilians don't usually carry anything extra. For the record, I'm in reserves. So not active military.

**princesskeestrr**: How do you choose a good shoe? In the reserves, do they provide shoes?

**SerSinalot**: They do in certain cases. I don't use them because they are shit I try to look at what professionals use, like cops, security guards, soldiers etc. I currently have Haix athletic 2.1 mid GTX. Been quite pleased with them. Shoes are user specific. I mean, if I didn't have reserve thing to worry about I'd use running shoes. I also have custom fitted insoles, which are equally as important.

**princesskeestrr**: My feet are very choosy. I've currently been using Xero shoes, which would probably benefit greatly from custom insoles.

**SerSinAlot**: Get them! Really.

**princesskeestrr**: I will listen to you

**SerSinalot**: It's a world of difference. I met a guy in Holland who did Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage from Holland. He did it in his work boots. Zero blisters.

**princesskeestrr**: They sort of promise the ""barefoot experience” which I am a huge fan of. If i could be barefoot always, I would be happy in my life. Now that is wild.

**SerSinAlot**: He just doesn't get them.

**princesskeestrr**: Robot feet

**SerSinAlot**: He was a tough motherfucker

**princesskeestrr**: Kind of guy who has callouses in all the right places

**SerSinAlot**: Callouses won't stop blisters

**princesskeestrr**: I don't know these things

**SerSinAlot**: I didn't either. A medic told me, that the blister just forms beneath the callous

**princesskeestrr**: Oh man

**SerSinalot**: Very unpleasent I hear

**princesskeestrr**: One time, i got very drunk. I played the electric bass for many hours and got this amazing blister on my right index finger. It was very gross. Both my bass playing and my blister.

**SerSinAlot**: I bet that was unpleasant as well.

**princesskeestrr**: I thought I was immune because of callouses, but now I see why I was mistaken. So, what else do you think people should know about rucking?

**SerSinAlot**: Weight isn't everything. Often newcomers focus on carrying too much. Rather focus on getting enough km's under the belt and then worrying about carrying heavier loads: I mean, if you can carry 10kg for 50km, you sure can carry 20-30kg the same distance.

Feet care and stretching are also important. Just like in any physical activity. Take care of your body and so on

**princesskeestrr**: I love this advice. You mentioned adding more about foot care to your Wiki, what other plans do you have for the sub?

**SerSinAlot**: At it's core rucking is just movement from point A to point B. In the military you also have to operate a mission during and/or after the ruck. That should always be kept in mind. More community rucks.

**princesskeestrr**: Oooh community rucks sound very fun

**SerSinAlot**: We have a list up. that I would like to see populated with events from around the world

**princesskeestrr**: Yes, yes, yes, that sounds awesome!

**SerSinAlot**: We had two last year. Both were on a very short notice, but we had a nice turnout [4-day New Year's Ruckathon](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rucking/comments)

**princesskeestrr**:  Maybe online community rucks too. I will see if my sub r/HealthOver30, would be up for one this summer. We can do a thread and share our experiences. Maybe I can cross post it?

**SerSinAlot**: Hell yeah! Wait [Ruckathon 2020](http://reddit.com/r/Rucking/comments/ds/ruckathon)

**princesskeestrr**: Oh, that's what you did! That's so cool!

**SerSinAlot**: [2021 Rucking events](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rucking/comments/mw.o//2021). There are many events during the summer months

**princesskeestrr**: Fantastic. I will gather all my people and see if we can get in on these. I'm very excited!

**SerSinAlot**: We have a long marching tradition in our military (thanks Germany) and Summer Night's Marches have been going on for decades

**princesskeestrr**: Well, I'm totally on board. Can't think of a better way to spend a summer night.

**SerSinAlot**: Hell yeah!

**princesskeestrr**: Thanks so much for your time today and please feel free to let me know if you have anything else to add. I'm going to write up your feature and try put it on the schedule for May. I appreciate you, your sub, and your mod team and all you do for the rucking community! And the health and wellness side of reddit in general.

**SerSinAlot**: Thank you for showing interest! I'm also in the 30 demographic so I gotta check out that sub as well.

**princesskeestrr**: Well, my sub was supposed to be very health-oriented, but then my life fell apart so now it's just me and 500 of my closest friends supporting each other the best we can. In other words. I love it there and I hope you join us.

**SerSinAlot**: Already did. Health just gets forgotten so easily with work and other stress. I know I forgot mine. I've been at this path only for the past 4 or so years

**princesskeestrr**: Same, it took me having kids to realize that life is more than making money

**SerSinAlot**: So true

**princesskeestrr** Talk about a rude awakening

**SerSinAlot**: I don't have kids. Knock on wood.

**princesskeestrr**: Lean into that

**SerSinAlot**: Thank you!

**princesskeestrr**: Enjoy that sound sleep and no one touching you while you are eating

**SerSinAlot**: This was fun. Hope to see you guys with heavy loads on your backs!

**503,000** *Failed comedians* for **8 years**!

What do you call a joke mixed with a rhetorical question?

r/antimeme is the perfect mix of r/technicallythetruth and r/memes, because most of the memes there rely on interpreting meme text literally, and adding something clever to the image, like this [Spiderman meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/mqvzom/its_hard_to_argue_with_his_assessment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), or this one about [self burns](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/m9qqcd/self_burn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

However, not all antimemes rely entirely on the meme's default text. 

Some, like this [one-in-a-million occurrence](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/mhxez7/what_are_the_chances/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) are essentially r/technicallythetruth material with a humorous intention. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/m7mmmk/there_are_still_three_rules/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) even adds text to the meme in order to make it fit a story.

Some simply rely on bluntness, like [this one about piss](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/g3rf20/gloup_gloup/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) or [this one about a friendly dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/jlypba/he_doesnt_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

All in all, there's a wider variety of strategies to remove all conventional humor from situations than you might expect, and every post you see on your feed will throw you off, and make you wonder how it was upvoted, until you see the sub name and once again criticize yourself for being such a fine connoisseur of humor that you didn't realize.

**~~198,519~~ 5,119,955** *summoners* for **~~2~~ 10 years**!
*****
[League of Legends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends) is a ""MOBA"" (multiplayer online battle arena) inspired by the classic [Defense of the Ancients for WarCraft III](http://www.wowwiki.com/Defense_of_the_Ancients_%28Warcraft_III_map%29) which was itself inspired by the classic but almost forgotten [Aeon of Strife](http://sc.nibbits.com/maps/project/76162/aeon-of-strife-2-beta5). I used to play Warcraft III *a lot*. I was a big fan of the AoS genre (what would become called MOBAs). But I was too hipster and edgy to play DoTA so I played [Tides of Blood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsRl_YS6QBU) and other silly games like Elemental TD and Island Defense. With League of Legends there are three lanes and you get to pick and [control](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjRFrbvmHRo) a champion while AI controlled units spawn every 30 seconds or something like that and attack the other AI controlled units. The goal is to push enough to get to the enemy's main base and destroy it. 

I used to play League of Legends. Or rather, I used to play [Riven](http://i.imgur.com/9qtFy.jpg). My [LoL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNez4UWZWLw) experience consisted of me and some friends on Skype. I would press [A](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8z2TYiBABU) to auto-attack some creeps in their lane while I minimized to check Reddit, they would tell me to maximize and I would spam some abilities and kill some champions and then go back to auto-attacking creeps and checking Reddit. I *was a beast*. Occasionally people would try to kill me but I would spam Q/E and I was [already gone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUAehy0_9Y). [You can't touch this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQJl-WhMZjw). Before Riven was released I would play Kassadin so he's my [second](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk7yPCHph2s) favorite but that was just to learn the game so I could dominate with Riven. [I am the best](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o) with Riven.

And if you don't have a lot of money because you spent it all on the Steam holiday sale then [don't cry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypit0NcNV-8) because League of Legends is free. Another good thing is that there's two sides to it. You've got your folks who just like to play the game and have fun and then you have your folks who are obsessed with ELO. Personally, my favorite is [Jungle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua12yFnqcvM). [Yours Truly, 2095](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb5TV7JUvzo) is a close second. I'm a big ELO fan, probably more obsessed than these LoLers and I don't even play the game, at least not anymore.

>##1. Why League of Legends?

>>   /u/Jaraxo It's FREE! You get a fantastic game, great casual and competitive levels of play, fantastic tournaments, some great personalities and you don't have to pay a penny.

>>   /u/Glyceroll Because you feel like a total badass from level 1 onwards! Also, I'm addicted to buying skins and telling myself it'll help me learn a champion. It works for about 2 games and then I never use the champ again until I get more inspiration (looking at you Lux).

>##2. What's your favorite champion?

>>    /u/Jaraxo Got to be Amumu. Sad little mummy child with no one to love, going around stomping on your lanes.

>>   /u/Glyceroll Diana, Leona, Pantheon, Miss Fortune, Caitlyn, Teemo... There's too many to list D:

>##3. What's your favorite champion's dance?

>>    /u/Jaraxo Malzahar is pretty awesome with the MC Hammer dance, though WW is pretty cool with Thriller.

>>   /u/Glyceroll I like Syndra's dance the most - followed closely by Ahri. No SNSD bias here.

>##4. What's your favorite item?

>>    /u/Jaraxo Heart of Gold. Seriously, I want that beast of an item back.

>>   /u/Glyceroll Liandry's Torment on AP Teemo.

>##5. What's your favorite skin?

>>    /u/Jaraxo Anyone who doesn't say Armour of the 5th Age Taric is a liar.

>>   /u/Glyceroll Armor of the Fifth Age Taric ;D

>##6. Do you ever summon things in real life?

>>    /u/Jaraxo [Yes.](http://i.imgur.com/qx2ki.gif)

>>   /u/Glyceroll Only small woodland creatures when I sing in the shower

>##7. LoL is a pretty popular competitive game, do you pay attention to the competitive scene or do you just play the game?

>>    /u/Jaraxo Some of it, when the champions I care about are being played or someone links to a good replay. I'm mainly watching IRC or the subreddit during the big games so there's little time to pay attention to it.

>>   /u/Glyceroll Of course! League and eSports are two peas in the same pod! I feel like you can't even get the full experience of LoL without following the competitive scene anymore. (Also FeaR/CLG EU #1)

>##8. What's your favorite K-Pop song (and don't act like you don't know)?

>>    /u/Jaraxo Gotta be [this](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa098s_girls-generation-sorry-sorry-live-a_music#.UOS9pG82ZoM) one.

>>   /u/Glyceroll [Lipstick - Orange Caramel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-d8EYwmdWA) // [Hoot - SNSD](http://youtu.be/F4-SxcCO5d0?t=33s) // [Nobody - Wonder Girls](http://youtu.be/BA7fdSkp8ds?t=2m4s). Once again there's way too many to list them all!

>##9. Do you have anything you'd like to say?

>>    /u/Jaraxo I want to say thanks to Rjbman and everyone else involved in setting up and running the IRC 5v5 games each week.

>>   /u/Glyceroll Shoutout to everyone! ILY ALL <3 (double extra shoutout to Comely and Optimal Tim, Chobra sux, and Helaina please forgive me for getting your name wrong <3)

Ever wondered how earth will look like in a thousand years? Even better: ever wondered how earth will look like in a thousand years, *in cartoon style*? Then Futurama is the place for you! Home of Zoidberg, Omicron Persei 8, and good news. 

Futurama is an awesome cartoon about a guy called Fry, who gets frozen by accident in 2000 and unfreezes in the 31th century. Talking robots, aliens, Nixon as president and many other sci-fi stuff come along his path as a delivery boy. 

You may think this subreddit is a bit too big to get nominated, but this [one is worth it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY7JMfor93o). Its amazing and funny members give you the best content. **So behave**. Even with the recent news about the show getting [cancelled](http://i.imgur.com/WXXXW7n.gif), they still remain awesome. 
To compromise stuff, I will feature a small subreddit in the near future. How do you like the sound of that?

So qweiopasd, who is *your* favourite character? Well, thanks for asking. My favourite would be the man with no name. [Zapp Brannigan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8ws_APXilE), at your service. *But why not Zoidberg?*. Well, because [Zoidberg is always number 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWoYmTAfDbk). He is so high in ranking that there needed to be a new list below him. And that's where we meet the glorious Zapp Brannigan. His smooth voice and classic battle/[love making tactics](http://i.imgur.com/z4U9y.jpg) beat every other rival. Try to read everything in his voice (even this write up), it makes them even better than a cold icecream on a hot mid-afternoon. 

So please do yourself a favor and go watch this cartoon. 


##I'll hopefully get the answers soon! 

**Until we get the answers I answered hem myself**

>#1. How did you get into Futurama, and why do you love it?
>> **qweiopasd** I think I first saw it on comedy central, and it was like love on first sight (cheesy). The great jokes smoothily put in this show are amazing, together with the realistic setting.

>#2. Who is your favorite character and why?
>>**qweiopasd** Zapp, and you already know that because I said it in the freaking write up, so why are you still reading this?

>#3. What is your favourite quote? And what about your favourite episode?
>>**qweiopasd** So many choices. A lot of my favourite are written in this feature. Bender always gives some good ones. For now I think the Snu-Snu episode, but that's because Im bad at remembering stuff in the heat of the moment.

>#4. I see that you are the only mod at r/Futurama, how can you handle such a big subreddit on your own? 
>>**qweiopasd** ERROR, FILE NOT FOUND

>#5. With many comedy series the viewers often believe that the serie is going downhill. Do you have the same thought about Futurama?
>>**qweiopasd** Well, I should probably realise it after a few more seasons, and that's the reason they cancelled it. But I prefer to quit watching a show because it's getting worse than getting forced to quit it while it's still in the prime of its life.

>#6. How do you think the world will look like in the year 3000?
>>**qweiopasd** As I said in a previous post, we will all be enslaved by the bears. But i like to think that there is peace everywhere and really cool technology stuff. Who am I kidding, I want to live in a by bears ruled world. I would be one of their best men.

>#7. How is the community like?
>>**qweiopasd** pretty awesome. They can be dicks sometimes, but aren't we all dicks?

>> *They can be dicks sometimes, but aren't we all dicks?*

>#8. Anything else you would like to add?

Have you ever read a book, finished it, and couldn't get it off your mind, so you went to see what strangers on the internet thought about it? The members of r/BadReads have, and they've realized that some people reviewing books on the internet are just a little bit crazy.

Sometimes a book review says more about the reviewer than it does about the book. [r/BadReads](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads) is a showcase of the most unhelpful book reviews from all over the internet, and includes reviews that are shallow, vapid, or completely missing the point. Steamy hot-takes abound!

It's the sub for poking fun at less-than-stellar and head-scratching book reviews -  reviews that make you shake your head and leave you speechless - reviews that make you  cry from laughing out loud so hard - reviews that make you utter simply, ""What the fuck...?""

What is a **BadRead**? Well, it could be...

* ...a [Goodreads review](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/g4sa8y/the_diary_of_anne_frank_absolute_debauchery/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that posits that the Diary of Anne Frank is actually, in fact, absolute debauchery
* ...when a certain conservative ""intellectual"" [tweeted](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/k0z54h/what_an_egoist_he_just_is_og_post_by_usidhejester/) about Obama's memoirs being too ""egotistical"".
* ...when Kate Ashbrook had a laugh at this [Amazon review](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/lwt9gf/imagine_working_hard_to_write_a_book_and_you_get/) that scolded the author for failing to predict the COVID-19 pandemic.
* ...this [Goodreads classicist](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/hwgn5w/no_words/) who prefers Rick Riordan to Homer.
* ...an interesting [summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/h17bm5/kinda_accurate_tbf/) of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*.
* ...men who will literally write goodreads [reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/jrlgua/i_do_that_every_night_already_son/) about their crippling alcoholism and depression before going to therapy.
* ...and a [reviewer](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/kfldgs/oscar_wildes_the_picture_of_dorian_gray_too_gay/) that couldn't possibly finish noted homosexual author Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray* for being...*checks notes*...too gay?

So now you have a place to go whenever you're scrolling through Goodreads reviews and stumble across Carol's rant about [the word ""Jesus"" being too offensive for publication](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadReads/comments/miq0ri/676_people_found_this_helpful/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and instead of only laughing by yourself, you can bless thousands of others with their inanity.

Happy 10th birthday, /r/AoE2. For nostalgia's sake, [check out AoE2's last feature here from July 2013](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1im7xm/july_19th_2013_raoe2_simply_a_classic/). 

It's been over 20 years since AoE2 came out and the scene has only gained in strength and numbers since. Things have changed since that day I brought home those boxed CDs and first began to fail horribly. I'm no longer the useless bottom-rung F-list player I once was. I'm older now. The rest is still accurate. I've never been good at RTS games, so I feel no shame in admitting that I am absolutely awful at AoE2, even though it's my favorite RTS. I bought it in a box when the Conqueror's expansion came out and they had a combination sale, and I've not gone more than a year without playing it since then. Yet, despite decades of practice, years of academy training, I am still probably only as good as a normal-ish AI. The day is fast approaching when I must come to terms with the fact that I'll never be an AoE2 pro, destined to get on cereal boxes, have a line of branded fortified stone walls, and star in my own daytime drama series titled 'I Built These Houses In The Wrong Order and Now I'm Stuck'.

Beyond my woes, AoE2 is an amazing game, and with the new expansion, the definitive edition, and the newly-announced AoE4, the scene has never been better. There are always players ready to eviscerate my posterior, livestreams from people who are eviscerating said posterior, and hundreds of guides on how best to eviscerate posteriors. The best of which, for those new to the game, is /r/AoE2's [own subreddit wiki for the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/wiki/index). Even now, after eons of playing, I only learned what exactly Wonder Race is from there. Now all I need to learn is why anyone would play that mode.

/r/AoE2 is the most active subreddit for Age of Empires, as it's the most popular of the series. It maintains a delicate balance of discussion, news, humor, and creative content that many communities struggle with. The community is fantastic, the mods are good, new players get help and advice, and nobody makes fun of me for running a strategy that involves sacrificing all my units and resources to the old gods in exchange for deep lore and eldritch power. It never works, but I need a cover story for how badly I play. In most games you'd expect the community, especially a big and active one, to have big and active problems, but /r/AoE2 is very chill, at least in my experience. Just don't make the same wololo joke for the ninetieth time, please.

Come celebrate /r/AoE2's 10th birthday by playing a game if you haven't in a while. It's like riding a bike, y'know. Once you click a villager and they make those weird noises, it'll all come rushing back. Then get fed up with those cheating AI bastards and spawn a bunch of Shelby Cobras with machine guns. I don't even need to remind you of the code to do that, do I? That's what I thought.

##Prologue

* The overcast of clouds cover the endless skies.
* The terrain is a meadow devoid of life and yet lush with green blades of grass as far as the eye can see.
* Square pattern grid of monolithic rocks are the only thing strategically placed on the field.
* The wind howls and whistles back and forth.
* A muted armada of transports come to a calming halt. 
* The released cargo within slowly grazes towards one specific point.
* A horde of silent black silhouettes hover around a patch of land that was pristinely excavated earth.
* The ceremony is about to commence.

##The End is the Beginning

Dear robots, cyborgs, humans, and everything in between and beyond. We are all gathered here today on this 2 month anniversary of Daft Punk officially announcing of their disbandment. For some it was writing on the walls, come to fruition. For others it was shocking news as if a dear friend's passed. All we can do now is mourn for the loss of the French Chevalier's of Dance.

This article was originally planned to be written the same week of the announcement itself. I realized I needed time to go through the 5 stages of grief and finally accept the grave news. Now I will try to give this the proper send off it deserves.

The only way I know how to mourn is to reminiscence of the good times gone by. Daft Punk's predecessor band [Darlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlin%27_(French_band\)) were on the cusp of greatness with tracks like  [""untitled 18""](https://youtu.be/bnNdNCS9DIY?t=238). Ironically, Darlin's self titled track could easily fit into Human After All's tracklist. If you end up liking Daft Punk give Darlin a once over.

Homework's Da Funk is a vibe that I still strive for. That entire album is raw electricity trapped in a bottle, so crisp and sharp it could diamonds. Vacuum packed, so the freshness is locked it. And great for the whole family, now even grandma can join in on the fun and stunt on these hoes. The music videos alone for this album are a time capsule of uniqueness.

###Sound [Discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2VpR8HahKc&list=OLAK5uy_lMA_iEf3aqk5YSDsnrPKojXegOiecSF94)

Yet it was the French duo's sophomore album, Discovery that I most resonate with. It was if Thomas and Guy-Manuel harnessed the soul of disco and mixed it with the purest form of crack money could buy and reincarnated House music over night. I can tell you there was a clear before and after version of myself. I must have listened to this album a few thousand of times. I still debate whether the original or the vinyl is better. [Interstella 5555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qxe-QOp_-s) is a treat in itself.

###Way too [Human After All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXYeARRyDWk&list=OLAK5uy_msPNeRpnTCKJlHBEhn3MAiR_hJ28_emHg)

Human After All, the duo's third round in the studio once again went in a completely different direction, namely Electronic-Rock. One with more harsher guitar notes yet with the same electronic rhythmic sound they were famous for. Leading to the classic problem with pioneers, when they introduce something new, it doesn't always become an instant hit. Sometimes you need to let it simmer and marinate its, so to fully appreciate its greatness. Sorta like cult classic movies are some of the most beloved. But were flops when originally released. Some fans even had the nerve to be mad that Daft Punk didn't remain stuck to House genre. Which is so stupid, you can't restrict artists from what type of art they want to create. When musicians dread change, their sound become formulaic and then you end up with [Nickelback.](http://gfycat.com/AggressiveWellinformedGuineafowl)

Random Access Memories, the duo's fourth and final studio album, came full circle, giving the masses the disco-pop album they didn't even know they wanted. Going completely raw sonically and flipping their tradition style of electronic music for a more real instrumental sounding album with only a Salt Bae sprinkle of autotune. Behind the scenes Daft Punk assembled an all star team of artists such as legends like Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, Nathan East, and Pharrell Williams to list only a few. This was the Frenchmen love letter to Disco and pop from the 70s & 80s.

##Honors & Merits

Daft Punk biggest achievement has to be making Dance music acceptable in mainstream. Without becoming the butt of jokes in the same vain people roll their eyes when talking about [ska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXA6CLTDekw), [scat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8) or even [early hip hop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZjAantupsA&t=22s) Musical tastes are subjective But if you want to explore something different the above mentioned songs are the best of the best Daft Punk has to offer. Not including [mashups](https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/search/?sort=top&feature=legacy_search&q=Daft+Punk&t=all&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on), mixes, remixes, collabs, productions, directorial, solo works or soundtrack projects obviously. To include those I would need to write a whole other article.

##Further interrogation with the MODs.

>#1. How has the community taken the news of Daft Punk's break up so far?

>>/u/IranianGenius Community has been largely shocked, mostly sad, but honestly altogether pretty stable throughout. Not many trolls, and lots of people using this as an experience to make artistic tributes. I've been positively surprised, especially after modding /r/Lakers when Kobe passed.

>>/u/Nintendult Many people have been very disappointed, even shocked by the news, especially given their long hiatus before announcing this. At the same time though, many have also taken the opportunity to show their love for Daft Punk through talking about their favorite songs and even sharing tribute art and remixes. Rather ironically, it feels as though Daft Punk's retirement has given us new life.

>>/u/OwMyDragonBallz The community has been heartbroken. But just like as most hardcore daft punk fans have been for years, there's still hope or belief that this isn't truly the end. So it's fun to see people not be devastated by the news. 

>#2. As super fans yourself, What Daft Punk song best describes your own feelings right now?

>>**IranianGenius** & **Nintendult** ""Something About Us"", as its somber vibes really resonate with us during this sad time.

>>**OwMyDragonBallz** My own feelings, I'd say ""Human after all"". The robots are only human after all. This was going to eventually happen. It's sad, because we always want more. I want to see them live at least once, but they are getting older and they are human after all. So they deserve this break and end.

>#3. Where were you when you heard your first Daft Punk song? What song was it?

>>**IranianGenius** *Harder Better Faster Stronger* but I'm not sure where or when. I feel like I've always known that song.

>>**Nintendult** Many years ago, I was watching a little animation compilation on YouTube which featured ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". Hearing that lovely song was what first got me into them.

>>**OwMyDragonBallz** Watching Toonami's Midnight Run Special Edition :-). It was when I was introduced to Gorillaz and Daft Punk in the same night.

>#4. As Daft Punk has changed music for the better, who are some new up and coming artists making strides in a similar fashion?

>>**Nintendult** Personally I have to strongly recommend Madeon and Porter Robinson, two artists who have been very closely inspired by Daft Punk and who have made great strides in electronic music and beyond. Check out Madeon's [""Miracle""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-IwlDzuTz0) and Porter Robinson's [""Look at the Sky""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuMz4v5PYKc).

>>**OwMyDragonBallz** Madeon, not necessarily new or up and coming. But I'd say he is the new French modern electronic music star. As far as House, I'd say Dombresky and Arno Cost definitely have the mantle for modern French house music. 

>#5. On a lighter note, what is your favorite Daft Punk meme or joke?

>>**IranianGenius** I like pixel art so I've always liked [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/5z50ax/did_a_daft_punk_pixel_art/), but if you want a straight 
meme, here's [this.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/98npuf/haha_ha/)

>>**OwMyDragonBallz** By far is the 10 year Alive meme. Every 10 years new tour please haha....

>#6. So we still on for ALIVE 2021? Right? RIGHT?

>>**Nintendult** Of course! I bet they will premiere the show on February 30th this year.

>>**OwMyDragonBallz** Absolutely 😁.

>#7. Any Last Remakes?

>>**Nintendult** As disappointed as I am that Daft Punk are ending their work, I'm hopeful that we can all continue to celebrate the robots' work for years to come.

**1,450,000** *$hibes HODLing* for **7 years**!

Do you have some spare change lying around? Something left over from your stimmy? Do you want to take something besides GME to the moon, but still be part of the meme? If you answered yes to any of these questions, (or even if you didn’t)  r/Dogecoin is the place for you. 

Dogecoin is the internet’s currency. Created as a meme (as all now-great things are) and based on one of the cutest dog breeds in existence, its animal magnetism has drawn both redditors *and* smart investors, and allowed it to blossom into a well-recognized and booming area for serious long-term investment. My wife’s boyfriend and I have both transferred our entire IRA balance into Doge, and when it hits $1, we’ll never have to work again.

*“Wait, did you say when it hits \*$1\*? So that means I can buy Doge with just some spare change and the spirit of a lucrative investor?”*

Yes, you can. Right now, one coin only costs ~~5~~ ~~10~~ 40 cents, which means that you can own over ~~1000~~ ~~500~~ 100 Doge for less than the price of a year of Reddit premium. Besides its cheapness, the beauty of Doge is how easy it is to invest. The subreddit has an entire [pinned post](https://old.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l87wcr/how_to_buy_dogecoin/?ref=share&ref_source=link) on how to do so, and tons of resources on the sidebar. You can even give Doge to other redditors with Tipbot, and avoid paying Reddit anything for their awards (few of which are as old or as valuable as Dogecoins).

And just in case any of you were thinking “well yeah, it seems fun, but it’s just a meme, it’ll probably die soon”, you may not be aware of how uniting or popular of a coin it really is. Several well-known figures have all expressed support for it, including Twitter’s favorite memelord [Elon Musk](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l9x9h0/doge_are_you_ready/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), award-winning actress [Mia Khalifa](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l8whq0/mia_khalifa_knows_whats_up/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), well-known plant enthusiast [Snoop Dog(g/e)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/mf6rbe/its_real_snoopdoge/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and prominent boater [Lil Yachty](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l8qyds/recent_tweet_from_lil_yachty_keep_faith/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). And even with all this support, the community stays humble, and dedicated to goals [paramount to personal wealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l6xitx/we_should/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

It's just a matter of time before Doge follows in the footsteps of other cryptocurrencies and goes to the moon. The only question is of who its astronauts will be.

The sub-Reddit provides all the information about Starlink Internet.

It provides information about the state of current deployment of satellites as well as future deployment plans.

Starship development is very relevant for deployment of satellites, as nearly 400 satellites can be deployed by a Starship in one launch (as compared to 60 satellites by a Falcon 9). Starship is fully reusable whereas Falcon 9 is partially reusable. Thus Starship will cut down the cost of deployment drastically.

The development of satellites itself is very relevant. Current version 1.0 doesn't have ISLL capability (except a few sent in polar orbit). Future versions, to be deployed next year will all have this capability. This will enhance the speed of data exchange between earth stations through satellites by an order of magnitude.

*Editor’s note: so yeah, this sub was nominated by their mods a while back. The feature they wrote reads like a advertisement on TV in an old sci-fi movie. That got my attention and made me want to watch the Fifth Element again. I loved that movie the first time I saw it. I watched it again a few years back and eh, I didn’t like it as much. I should watch it again to see if I was just in a bad mood the second time. Also, I’d like to see the new Blade Runner, but I keep falling asleep every time I try to watch it. I hear that it is better than the first one.*

*Anyway, to tell you the truth, I don’t know much about satellite internet. Is it reliable? I don’t know. Is it fast? Not sure. Is it expensive? Probably. Personally, I’m kind of excited that there may be an alternative to the two internet providers in my area soon and thought that the readers here may feel the same. Plus, it was fun having a look around this community. Check it out when you have the chance, or take a gander at the three top posts I included below*:

Solve for X:

(Dinosaur - Big) + Arms = X

That's right. X is birds. Do you now see how utterly screwed we are? Well, you don't even know the half of it.

Forget climate change. Forget alien invasions, plagues, nuclear war, capitalism, meteors, solar flares, and the always-too-soon 20th Anniversary St. Anger remaster. What will really kill off the world will be birds with arms. Mark my words: Birds with arms will be the end of us all if we do not act now to stop them.

Just look at them. Every post on /r/birdswitharms is its own advertisement for the upcoming Bird War Freedom Bonds. The avian menace must be stopped by any means necessary, lest they conquer the world. Maybe beyond? With birds able to replicate, consume, and grow so quickly, we could even be faced with an apocalyptic Grey Goose scenario.

Since I've got nothing at all that will suddenly tear me away from my computer and hold me captive for weeks in a cell with strong, feathered arms, constantly quacking at me about the numbers while they put jumper cables on my special space, I shall take this opportunity to explain, in full detail, the true danger of the /r/birdswitharms threat, and how humanity can act against it now, before it's too late.

#[/r/Horror](/r/horror)

**~~10,962~~ 2,338,975** *maniacs*, a community for ~~4~~ **13 years!** 

So, uhh--this is weird. I completely forgot this week's scheduled day was supposed to be one of impish merriment. But you know what? I'm going to go ahead anyways- /r/Horror deserves it's day in the spotlight, and here's why.

- The sound of your heart pounding in your ears. The cold weight in your chest. The prickling sensation that presses up your spine. We've all felt the stab of terror while enjoying a horror novel or scary movie- we've all loved it. We're creatures of adrenaline, and a movie ticket, is easier to get and cheaper(?) than a bag of heroin.

- Ugliness has always been an aspect of our culture, but for the most part it has belonged to the fringe. For every painting of an engorged Medusa, there's 4 or 5 works of a limpid and pale Aphrodite, lounging on a couch. It's a refreshing change to see the uggos rule for once!

- I personally don't like it when movies get preachy. For example, I bought a full crate of tuna just to spite the people who made *the cove*. And you know what? The spite makes it taste all the better. But in works from Cronenberg and Romero, we're more than happy to reflect on matters such as death and consumerism (as long as we get giant flies and zombie hordes too.)

But don't take my word for it! The spooky mods of /r/Horror, RipperM and Dearon, spoke to the SROTD team about Dreaddit:

>Which book/movie/etc first got you interested in the horror genre?

>>RipperM: That's actually a tough one to answer. I became obsessed with the darker side of life at such an early age. I remember in the early seventies, before I was old enough to start school, I used to raid my older brother's record collection. He had an album by a band called Blood Rock. There was a song called D.O.A. It was about a band in a plane crash, and the lead singer describing himself slowly bleeding to death. I used to listen to it over and over.

>The first movie I remember seeing in a cinema was ""It's Alive"". I think I was 6 or 7. Of course now it seems cheesy and ridiculous, but it scared the hell out of me at the time. It just snowballed from there and horror has been a huge part of my life ever since.

>>Dearon: What really got me started was when I was a teenager and tried to find the most horrible movies to watch with friends. The whole ""show how awesome we are"" thing which, I assume, most people have experienced. The main titles I can remember from that time, to give a idea of the types of movies, are Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer and I Spit on Your Corpse, I Piss on Your Grave (unlike the other two this one is not very good at all). In watching this stuff I realized how much I like the genre and started to hunt down everything I could get my hands on. Leading to me having seen many many movies over the years.  


>What do you think makes for really good horror?

>>RM: For me, a really good story before anything. A good build up of suspense and dread as well. To me that’s more satisfying than jump shock type stuff.

>>RM:Also plenty of spraying blood, decapitations, eviscerations and boobies doesn’t hurt either.

>>D: The main thing that makes horror good horror for me personally is the underlying theme of being ""confronted"" with things whom are not acceptable in the real world. Think of things like brutal murder or rape. Through this, in combination with the tone of the movie, it becomes possible to explore taboo topics and see how I personally feel about them and what kind of thoughts they generate. Plus there is always the option to turn if off if things becoming overpowering to the person watching (which is useful when trying to show something to family, haha).

>Most under-rated horror movie/book in your opinion: GO.

>>RM: One of the first to come to mind is Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Of course it had absolutely zero to do with the Halloween franchise, which is the main reason it failed so miserably. I'm convinced that if it had been given a different title, maybe just ""Season of the Witch"", it would have done much better. The whole premise is ridiculous, but it's a fun watch. A more recent one that deserves more attention would be “Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (2006)”. It’s about a psycho who allows a documentary crew to follow his life as he plans his killing spree. Very cool film.

>>D: I can never narrow it down to just one, so here is a small selection. [Ebola Syndrome](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116163/) from 1996, overall one of the more messed up movies i have seen. Big trigger warning on this movie for those who are sensitive to that by the way. [Hell of the Living Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082559/) from 1980, my personal favorite zombie movie so far (has a interesting production history as well). [Red to Kill](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111037/) from 1994, this one had a large influence on how I feel toward rape in a emotional sense (as opposed to seeing it from a purely intellectual viewpoint). This too needs a (big) trigger warning. [Street Trash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094057/) from 1987, this one has some really amazing gore. And finally [Teenage Exorcist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111383/) from 1991, not the most refined horror movie ever but I had a ton of fun with it.

>Is there anything you would like to change about your subreddit? If so, what?

>>RM: More in depth discussions couldn’t hurt. But really, It’s running pretty smoothly right now.

>>D:We recently launched a chatroom (##reddit-horror on Freenode) which could see some more activity, but other than that I am happy with the way things are.

>What is your least favorite scary movie cliche?

>>RM: People in horror movies alway seem to have the shittiest cell phone providers.

>>“I don’t have a signal!”

>>“Neither do I!”

>>[stab stab stab]

>>D:The whole ""hey, let's be complete idiots and do everything in the worst possible way"" trope is getting really old by now. But luckily it doesn’t seem to be used that often any more.

>Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Horror?

>>RM: You guys are the flesh and blood (and gristle, intestines, arterial spray) of /r/horror. Keep up the good work.

>No, seriously. Keep supplying us with great content and discussion or I will murder your entire family.

>>P.S. You don’t only have to message us when your post is in the spam filter. We also welcome your suggestions and ideas. So... Do that.

>>D:I wish you all many more years so that you can enjoy your lives and watch many more horror movies :D

When most people think of the Titanic, they think of three words or phrases: iceberg, unsinkable, and “Jack could have easily fit on that door”. But what they may not think about is the history that often pervades pop culture, and how people conceptualize the tragedy across generations through mediums like art, film, and writing. r/Titanic is essentially a grab bag of all of these things, and even includes content that isn’t directly about the ship itself. To quote u/DarkNinjaPenguin, a moderator of the sub, 

> We're not a huge sub, but we love all things Titanic related - the ship, her history, her sisters and others of the era, and of course the numerous films. While other subs like r/RMS_Titanic focus more on strict historical discussion, we're sort of a free-for-all for relaxed discussion of anything Titanic-related. We've had relatives of passengers talking about their families' experience, plenty of discussion on the technical aspects of the ship, and even some short stories set on board.

And, with the anniversary of the voyage this week, there’s plenty of content for even the most casual boating or Celine Dion fan to enjoy.

***Holly**: You know those days when you get the mean reds?*

***Paul**: The mean reds? You mean like the blues?*

***Holly**: No. The blues are because you’re getting fatter and maybe it’s been raining too long; you’re just sad, that’s all. The mean reds are horrible though. Suddenly you’re afraid, and you don’t know what you’re afraid of. Do you ever get that feeling?*

I do get that feeling actually. I experience the mean reds and the blues, and I’ll take the blues any day. I used to try and justify the ruminating thoughts and would even invent things of which to be afraid. When I couldn’t imagine something horrific enough, my brain would thrust forth events of the past that could explain the gripping in my chest, the emptiness deep inside of me, and my racing brain. It pulled me back into the past like a time traveler, causing me to relive terrible events, impotent to change anything, watching helplessly from above, a crimson cast over the scene. How do I know what I looked like, what the space looked like, from that angle? It can’t be real. Right?

***Me**: Alternatively, I can just continue to drive everywhere myself for the rest of my life. Let’s choose a new visual. How about salmon swimming downstream?*

***Her, sighing**: We can’t continue like this. I am going to call the office and ask for a new therapist recommendation to give you if we don’t make some headway before the end of the month.*

***Me**: I came to you for abandonment issues!*

My cat, who doesn’t have the same sense of tragic irony as my therapist, can sense when my heart speeds up and the mean reds are on their way. He crawls up on my chest and presses his body against my too-fast beating heart and his rumbling purr allows me to come back into my own mind. ***Snap** back to reality, ope there goes gravity. Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter* ... oh shit, wrong feature. Wait, is r/suddenlyeminem a thing? If not, it should be.

I’m supposed to be writing about r/audreyhepburn, an amazing subreddit that celebrates the life of the amazing woman, philanthropist, humanitarian, actress, and fashion icon. But right now, it’s early morning and I’m a mess, so I am thinking of the opening scene of Breakfast at Tiffany’s in which a beautiful woman is awakened by a lost writer. The thing is, when Audrey Hepburn plays a mess of a person, she does it with [unbelievable grace](https://www.reddit.com/r/audreyhepburn/comments/hti0ao/audrey_hepburn_in_breakfast_at_tiffanys_1961/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). Me? I pick myself off the kitchen floor where I blacked out three hours ago, with flashes of my nightmares still swimming in my mind’s eye. Instead of a satin sleep mask, tasseled ear plugs, and ballet slippers in the refrigerator, I’ve got frizzy hair, smudged eyeliner, and a lot of regrets. Speaking of which, I have some posts and outgoing DMs to delete.

*You mustn’t give your heart to a wild thing.*

That’s another quote delivered by Audrey Hepburn’s character, Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany’s. So far, I’ve broken every heart that’s ever been given to me, but have at least [named my cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/audreyhepburn/comments/irfoie/promo_for_breakfast_at_tiffanys/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), unpacked almost all of the boxes from the last time I moved, and have furniture in nearly every room of my house. While the [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/audreyhepburn/comments/gwm0it/portrait_on_a_leaf/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) I’ve put down here have established themselves with strength, I feel their wiry tendrils climbing me, holding me claustrophobically as I try to relax into them. I want to trust that they will support me and not constrict me, ground me and not smother me, and wrap me in a sense of belonging.

And when it comes down to it, I suspect that Holly didn’t really believe that nothing bad ever happened at a place like Tiffany’s, it was that nothing there mattered, at least not really. The shine, the beauty, and the wealth were a distraction, a facade, a simplicity in a complicated world. It was a place where pain, responsibility, love, vulnerability, and authenticity would wait at the door, a vapid escape. A better escape is r/audreyhepburn. Just as much beauty, but with substance, kindness, and community. I hope that you all head over there and enjoy this subreddit as much as I do and that you all find the place where you belong.

**185,990** *Arbitrary Submitters* for **9 years!**

I recently discovered an amazing community and I knew immediately that I had to do a feature on it. When I went to r/196 for the first time, I read that the only rule is to post before you leave. So, I asked [the burning questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/196/comments/m4dprn/what_is_this_place/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) that are on everyone’s mind who is uninitiated.

[“What is this place?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/196/comments/lzmess/what_is_this_place_and_how_do_i_leave/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

[“And ... why is this place?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/196/comments/khk98v/why_did_i_read_the_rule/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

After this foray into r/196, I have to admit that, while I still wasn’t quite sure what was happening there, it was definitely *something* and it didn’t seem to be as simple as what everyone was making it out to be. Fortunately, I had a few tricks up my sleeve to uncover the mysteries of this wonderful subreddit for you, our avid readers here at SROTD.

I reached out to the moderators of r/196, who were unbelievably friendly and open to talking with me. They even taught me how to use Discord. Before they came into my life, I just opened the app and hoped for the best. “Conal? Xavier? Guys? How do I find you on here?” I love this about Reddit so much, have I mentioned this? Everyone is so much nicer to me here than IRL. One redditer DM’d me this morning *specifically* to inquire after the wellbeing of my a!#hole. So thoughtful! Anyhow, as per my usual, I am getting too far off topic, so without further ado, here is my interview with none other than u/Memekip, the founder/head mod and u/Thot_patrol_official, the most active moderator of this fabulous community. I hope that you enjoy!

**PK: Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>**MK**: When r/195 closed down, I promptly asked the old owner of r/196 for permission to moderate the subreddit with the intention of continuing the idea of 195: A subreddit with the 1 rule ""If you visit, you must post before you leave"". And after the sub started to rapidly grow as people migrated, the old owner left, leaving me as the new head moderator. The sub was originally just a continuation of 195, but it has since evolved to have its own identity.

**PK: What is it like moderating this subreddit?**

>**TPO**: At least for me, moderating 196 isn't super hard. Although that's probably because I mostly scour new instead of comment sections like 8courics does. It's really laid back because we're not treated like the employees as some company, it's just a ""moderate at your own pace"" type of deal. Obviously this can lead to patches not cover by moderation, but overall it's a positive effect for the mod team.

**PK: What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?**

>**MK**: I can't name a particular favorite post, but I am a fan of the random trends that happen due to the sub's chaotic nature. Such as the defacto mascot being a Caracal, the memes that were made as a result of the only two flairs ""Linux > Windows"" and ""trans rights"",  a sub-wide debate over which style of Pillar is superior, and so on. It's always entertaining to watch those as they unfold.

**PK: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>**MK**: I personally don't have any radical long-term plans, other than to keep the subreddit running smoothly, and maybe do more fun projects with it similar to r/196x in the future if any come to mind (same concept as 196, but exclusive to a list of 3000 approved submitters, drawn from those who've submitted 4 or more times to 196 prior to the draw)

**PK: What makes 196 special?**

>**TPO**: There’s a lot that can be said here. There few limits on what you can post (barring transphobia, racism, nsfw content, etc) which basically leads to the community developing its own meme trends. There's very little input on what goes on in the sub from the mod team, so every single trend and meme is made and moderated by the community. This is really interesting in my opinion because you get somewhat of a culture study from what the subreddit does. Will they make this meme a trend in the subreddit? How will the trend die within the sub? What do the users think of the meme trend? What kind of culture do they create with little to no supervision? It's all extremely interesting and I feel like it could warrant its own case study, although understandably I am biased. I feel very honored to be apart of such a unique and ever-growing community, even if I am really just a glorified janitor in it. I am excited to see what tomorrow brings with this diverse community.

**PK: It is pretty fantastic and I think you are more than just a glorified janitor, it’s not easy to keep such a creative and active community going. You guys do an amazing job and I am very impressed with your sub.**

>**TPO**: Haha thank you for the kind words, I'm glad you enjoy it.

Indeed. I hope this clarifies everything for all of you. Personally, I enjoy r/196 very much and I totally know what is going on. Completely. In fact, if you want to tell me your theory, DM me with it, and I will tell you if it is correct. Before I sign off, I would like to say that this sub is a nice place full of supercool people and I hope you all check it out. Head on over and be sure to read the rule!

So many conspiracy theories these days are just baseless, idiotic drivel spouted by people who have no idea what they're talking about. It's a nice change to finally see a new conspiracy theory that is actually reasonable for once.

I'm sure you've all heard of Flat Earth theorists. Idiots who think the earth is flat, for some reason, and who ignore all evidence to the contrary. They're fun to meme about, but if you look a little closely, their true purpose becomes clear. While we're all laughing at the idea that the Earth is flat, we're all missing the ***real*** conspiracy. The one that the governments don't want you to think about too much.

There is no Earth.

I mean, really. It's just so damn obvious. Earth is meant to be in between Mars and Venus in the solar system. You look up in the night sky and you can see [Venus](https://i.redd.it/ulcgc6zu9ac41.jpg), you can see [Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1808/TahaGhouchkanluTLE2018.jpg), but where's Earth up there? Exactly. Big Planet is lying to you.

Here at SRotD, we're dedicated to bringing you the real facts about the world that the admins don't want you to hear. Whether that be the [truth about """"""giraffes""""""](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/mhtr9v/april_1st_2021_rgiraffesdontexist_setting_the/), or [how Big Oxygen are controlling the world ](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/lem0sa/february_7th_2021_rlowstakesconspiracies_the_best/). Today, we're exposing the real facts about the world, or lack thereof, by telling you all about /r/NoEarthSociety. A group of *Free Thinkers™* who can see past the lies of the world around them, destroying the narrative with [Facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Noearthsociety/comments/e11lw4/cant_spawn_if_it_aint_real/) and [Logic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Noearthsociety/comments/c28jse/the_truth_cannot_be_hidden_any_longer/). Also, [Oxford Commas](https://old.reddit.com/r/Noearthsociety/comments/izjr2k/open_discussion_about_the_origins_and_history_of/). Why do they exist? They just seem like a weird, unnecessary, and confusing bit of gramma**aah fuck get out of my head get out of my head get out o-**

&nbsp;

Now it's time to start asking the *real* questions. If the Earth doesn't exist, what else doesn't? The Moon? The government? Is /r/SubredditoftheDay even a thing? Does /r/NoEarthSociety even exist, or is it just a plot by Big Big Earth to deceive us all into thinking that the Earth doesn't exist?

---

It's been a long time coming. Years since the day when mankind received a grim reminder, and when we were introduced to the brave soldiers who let humanity soar on the wings of freedom. Since its manga publication began in 2009, and since its anime debut in 2013, millions have dipped their toes into Attack on Titan, and wound up absorbed in it. It's the kind of series that you don't just watch one episode of, or read one chapter of, unless you're painfully waiting for the next. Now, with the final chapter going live on April 9th, many of us fans will have nothing left to wait for.

There's no need to oversell it; it's one of the best-selling manga series of all time, one of the most popular anime of the modern age, and recognizable at a glance by just about everyone under the age of 50. It reached those top echelons without resorting to pointless filler, spending hundreds of chapters on tiny incremental progression, or power creep and a once-per-arc [Worf Effect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect), which you see in some other best-selling series. Attack on Titan has been a linear progression of a single story from start to finish, growing in scale, but never moving away from the themes that made so many people fall in love with it in the first place. While I wasn't a fan of humanity's back no longer being against the wall when the post-Basement truth was revealed, they ended back there anyway, so I'm cool with it. Pretty sneaky, Isayama.

A shout-out for Hajime Isayama is needed here. Be sure to thank him for giving such a great series to the world. He made Attack on Titan straight out of school, which turned into this giant phenomenon, so much so that I'll forgive him for [not including the flaming katanas from his original draft](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_on_Titan_Volume_0#Weaponry), even though that would have been sick.

For what feels like eons, I've kept up the same routine with few breaks: read the new chapter, read the chapter discussion thread on /r/ShingekiNoKyojin, read some posts from smart people on the sub talking about all the things I missed/forgot/was too dumb to figure out, and repeat. I'll check out the art posts, look at the memes, and downvote the spoilers like a true champion of humanity ought to. It's a constant thing, and for a fan of any series coming to an end, the loss of that series is a powerful thing. Though /r/ShingekiNoKyojin will live on in its community, especially as the second half of the final season is yet to air, soon I'll have no spoilers to downvote, no new chapters to discuss, and no wild speculation posts to read in wonder at witnessing such majestic wrongness. I'll still come for the memes, though. Through memes we are all immortal.

We reached out to the mods with some questions. They responded; some with titan-sized answers.

###1. First off, could you tell us a bit about yourselves?

> **DarthMewtwo:** [Hello there!](https://media1.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/200.gif) My name's Ziah (also known as DarthMewtwo), and I'm 22 years old. I've been a member of this subreddit for seven years and moderating it for six. In my offline life, I work in the gaming industry, and am also quite into playing AR games such as Ingress and Pokémon GO.

> **sleepy-heichou:** Hi! I’m sleepy-heichou. I’m 24 years old, and I often spend my time alternating between modding, watching anime, reading books and manga, and talking to friends I’ve made through Reddit (and because of our shared love of Shingeki no Kyojin). Outside of my internet life, I work in the arts, and I also write about it occasionally.

> **Reuels:** Hey everyone! My name is Reuel and I’m 21 years old. I’ve been a Reddit moderator for around 3 years and have been a moderator for r/ShingekiNoKyojin for almost two. My main interests include video games/esports, anime, kpop and computer science.

> **Mugiwara1411:** Hello! This is Aditya, a 21 year old average Attack on Titan fan that hates spoilers and people who spoil, which is majorly the reason why I have been wanting to help the community remain spoiler free and enhance the experience of the people who are new to the show and the community as a whole for quite some time, hence I’m very grateful for getting this opportunity to be able to moderate one of the biggest snk forums online. As far as my personal life is concerned, I’ve got some pretty normal goals that I possibly hope to achieve. As time passes, I hope to impact the lives of a lot of people in a positive way and learn more about life and the experiences it has to offer.

> **H-K_47:** Hey! I'm H-K from Canada. Big fan of anime and manga in general, but love all sorts of media including movies, books, live action shows, etc. SnK's been part of my life for a significant chunk of it at this point, been with me through many milestones. SnK may be over but of course life continues, and just gotta keep moving forward.

###2. How did you discover and get invested in the series?

> **DarthMewtwo:** I was introduced to Attack on Titan through my high school's anime club, way back in my sophomore year. It was the same week that the season 1 finale aired, and we accidentally watched an absolutely cursed translation of the series known as Eoten Onslaught. I swiftly binged the rest of the anime (though with the proper translation, of course), and picked up the manga after going back and forth on if I should remain anime-only. The first new chapter I was around for was chapter 52, in December 2013 - it's hard to believe it's been that long!

> **sleepy-heichou:** My brother introduced me to Attack on Titan in 2016, although I only got to catch up with the anime in 2017 after I graduated, as I had more free time to spend. Right after the end of Season 2, I continued on with the manga. Since then, it’s been a wild ride of almost four years. I think getting into the manga at a point in the story where the conflict became much bigger than just a simple fight against giant, man-eating monsters helped me see how well-thought and planned the entire series was. It also resonated with me on a personal level, especially the way each of the characters dealt with their reality, their traumas, the things beyond their control, and the inevitable consequences of their actions. The developments plot-wise and character-wise are, I think, the highlight of this series. There is an inherent complexity in the way they are written that I found I appreciated a lot.

> **Reuels:** Attack on Titan was one of the first ever animes I watched. I believe I watched it dubbed for my first experience as it was on Netflix, then I rewatched it subbed to see the difference. The animation, plot and characters got me so invested into the show and I want more; so eventually I delved into the manga because I just couldn’t bear the 4 year gap between Seasons 1-2. Ever since then, I’ve been an avid follower of the series!

> **Mugiwara1411:** I discovered the series through MAL (My Anime List), had read the synopsis of the story quite a lot of times and every time I read it, I wondered what kind of a gruesome and fascinating experience does it have in store for me. I finally watched the show 4 years ago and it goes without saying that I was blown away by the animation, the soundtrack and of course the storyline. I picked up the manga 2 months ago and am fully caught up as of now.

> **H-K_47:** First watched the anime 8 years ago back in 2013. Joined the community and started reading the manga in early 2014. I remember back when it was only about 30K subscribers big. Oh how it's grown! This community was a large part of why I joined Reddit at all. Now I'm stuck here. Thanks guys! My story is pretty common, heard about the show even though I wasn't an anime fan, adored Season 1, and jumped aboard the manga train during the long, long wait for Season 2. Been reading month to month and keeping up with the anime. I've been in and out of the community and hopping across all the different subreddits for years.

###3. What are some of your favorites, and why? Chapters, episodes, characters, shady face close-ups, whatever you'd like to talk about.

> **DarthMewtwo:** My absolute favorite character in the series has always been Hange Zoe. As soon as they were introduced in the anime I fell in love with their wacky, Titan-obsessed personality. Additionally, though this didn't become a factor until several years into my consumption of the series, Hange is canonically nonbinary/gender nonconforming; I figured out I was transgender a few years back, so that added personal connection to the character has only solidified their place as number one in my heart. As for other favorites... you absolutely can't beat the suspense, intrigue, and heart-pounding action of the Festival arc! I was so happy to see it finally get animated this year!

> **sleepy-heichou:** I really like the characters of Captain Levi, Eren Yeager, and Reiner Braun, among others. I personally think those 3 stand out in terms of how they were fleshed out, both in personality, attitude, and also their involvement in the story, specifically in how their actions influenced, and continue to influence, the direction in which the series is headed. As a reader, I’m interested not only in how realistic these characters act within their prescribed environment, but also the range of human emotions they are able to project. For instance, I know that titans do not exist in real life, but by making titans exist in their world, Hajime Isayama, the creator, was able to bring out and explore different facets of human nature. As for favourite moments in the series, I still think the events in Season 3 Part 2 is where Attack on Titan reached its peak plot-wise. That’s not to say Season 4 is not as good, but I think S3 P2’s arc brings everything full circle, all the way from the series’ beginning in Season 1. I still rewatch and reread this arc and there’s not a moment I dislike in it. I think everything there was so well-done, from the developments the characters were forced to face, the decisions they were compelled to make, and how these decisions affected the overarching storyline. The anime did an even better job in bringing this arc to life, from the choice of music (or lack of it, in certain scenes), to the stylistic technicalities. I remember going on discussion threads and seeing such an overwhelmingly positive reaction to it.

> **Reuels:** My favorite character is the main character, Eren Yeager. In my opinion, he’s my favorite main character out of all the anime I’ve watched. I’ve loved his character development from Seasons 1-4 and his development in the manga. Close favorites would have to be Levi, Hange and Jean. My favorite episode is tied between two, Season 3 Episode 17, “Hero” and Season 4 Episode 7, “Assault”. I’m always a sucker for the action-packed scenes where it’s chaotic and the conclusion of all the buildup from previous episodes. It feels rewarding.

> **Mugiwara1411:** Once I started to jot down my favourite moments from the series (anime/manga), I realised there are just way too many so I gave up on mentioning all the specific episodes/chapters instead I’ll just write some scenes that come to mind instantly which include – Everything from episode 1 to episode 75, sorry, can’t really pick. As far as manga chapters are concerned, we all know that sensei has come a long way and his art has been fantastic for the last 12-13 volumes, personally my favourite is volume 32 (127 – 132), volume 27 (106-110), volume 28 (111-114), volume 30 (119-122) and more but I have a feeling I’ll end up including all the 32 volumes at this rate. Out of the ones that haven’t got bundled in an official English translated volume yet my favourites are chapter-131,132 and 134. 

> **H-K_47:** Over the years the story has really developed a TON. It's always shaking things up and introducing new elements, as characters rise and fall in prominence. Originally I was a huge fan of Armin, but eventually realized the greatness of Erwin. I've had quite a few favourites over the years. Hange, Levi, Jean, Historia, Eren, Zeke, and yes even Flocke. Erwin is still the king though! I love how the story tackles ""larger than life"" characters by often giving them very human motivations and flaws. You can see their reasoning clearly and empathize with them. All fighting against this cruel world. It was amazing to see what they could pull off and how far they could get. My favourite parts would have to be the entire Clash Arc (manga equivalent of Season 2), Uprising intrigue, Erwin's charge in RTS, the initial Basement reveals, the Declaration of War, the Jaegerists, and the famous Chapters 120-123 and 130-131. The scope and scale of it is awe inspiring.

###4. What do you love most about the community? Do you have any favorite posts you'd like to share?

> **DarthMewtwo:** The best part of this community has always been the sheer creativity of our members. Whether it be through gorgeous artwork by creators such as /u/OmarvinG94 or glorious shitposts such as /u/boss_on_air's [replacement of every horse in the first 100 chapters with Jean's face](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/7t6sl8/manga_spoilers_ive_replaced_every_single_horse/), this community never stops creating incredible content. In fact, I'm proud to have a print of [one of my favorite pieces of community art](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/gdkjyw/i_spent_some_time_painting_this_rage_my_soldiers/) framed on the wall above my desk, and I intend to eventually get prints of all of the Titans from different community artists.

> **sleepy-heichou:** I think it’s the relationships you inevitably build from constantly talking about the series. I’ve met amazing people here whom I eventually became friends with and we’ve reached a point where we talk about things other than SnK, which honestly really helped me throughout the pandemic. But I also think one of the best things about this fandom are theories people are able to come up with to tie the story together. I don’t really mind if these theories become canon, but the ability to weave multiple interpretations of the story with the elements that we’re given or have been set up across various chapters just goes to show how well-made SnK is. And regardless of what the ending may be, I’d personally rather choose to remember the highlights of this series, which are many and varied across almost all arcs. More so, being able to voice out my opinion and discuss things about the story, especially the philosophical elements of it, was definitely something I appreciate about the fandom. I’ve learned many things from this series that have affected my own personal worldview, and allowed me to reflect on the ideals I believe in. As for favourite posts, just sort through Top on our sub! Lots of well-written theories, fanart, and memes. The monthly chapter discussion threads are also hilarious to read through. Some comments make you laugh, others make you think.

> **Reuels:** This is going to sound cheesy, but one of the things I love about our community is witnessing the love we have for this series. Whenever a new episode comes out or a new chapter, I love watching initial reactions on our discussion threads. I’m a big fan of the shitposts and memes that our community has the creativity to create because I could never come up with some of these posts. The fanart the community has created has been amazing to see as well! One of my favorite aspects so far is the theorycrafting people have done to predict the ending of the series. Reading everyone’s theories and seeing if they make sense have been a great read. My favorite posts of all time on the subreddit have to be one of the most simplest memes, but they never fail to make me laugh. Posts like [this](https://redd.it/l0jl1u) and [this one](https://redd.it/kx7lqf) are top tier content.

> **Mugiwara1411:** Despite of how the community is infamous right now because of its toxic side, I believe that any fandom that corresponds to a cultural phenomenon like AoT will most likely go through this phase. To be honest the part of the community that I like the most is the people who are just beginning the show and who come to the subreddit for sharing their experiences and to find out if there are others like them who have been completely blown away by this masterpiece. Some of the posts that I absolutely love are  [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/jq7m60/isayama_inspecting_his_kids/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/l0vuwi/this_is_basically_me_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

> **H-K_47:** What I've been most surprised about is how huge the community has grown. Just mind bogglingly larger than it was all those years ago, spilling over into multiple large subreddits. The variety of opinion and the sheer quality and quantity of new content being created is amazing. Too many wonderful theories and arts to dream of sharing. Though, I've always been deeply amused by the fact that despite all the ship wars and morality debates and theory analysis, according to Reddit's algorithm, the [most controversial post of all time here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/controversial/?sort=controversial&t=all) is [some dude's photoshop of his grandpa](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/28sp2l/turned_my_grandpa_doing_laundry_into_an_epic/).

###5. Is there anything else you'd like to say?

> **DarthMewtwo:** Though this manga may have come to an end, I'm sure this isn't the last we'll be seeing of this franchise. For better or for worse, we already know there's a Hollywood adaptation in the works, and of course, there's always the rest of the anime to look forward to! I'm excited to see what the future holds in store for us. Onwards to the next adventure - [Shinzou wo sasageyo!](https://i.imgur.com/a1ux4RW.gif)

> **sleepy-heichou:** First, I want to thank my fellow mods who have been working really hard to keep things well-organised in the subreddit. It was great being able to mod alongside some of the most amazing people in this fandom. In spite of having been a fan for only four years, they’ve been more than welcoming and fun to talk to; I’m really thankful for this opportunity.  Second, despite the manga coming to an end, the anime will still be airing next year, so please continue to support the series. And do visit our subreddit if you still haven’t! Even if you’re just about to start reading the manga, or watching the anime, or are still in the midst of catching up to either, our discussion threads are very organised and interesting to read through as you progress in your SnK journey. And lastly, to the many people I’ve had the pleasure of interacting with in the years I’ve been in this fandom, I hope that we still get to talk to each other in some form, perhaps as fans of another anime or manga series. I’m glad to have been able to contribute my time as both a fan of SnK, and a moderator of this community. I could only hope I’ve done a well enough job, and am more than happy to have been here to see the story of Shingeki no Kyojin unfold.

> **Reuels:** Thanks for choosing us as Subreddit of the Day! I hope everyone in the community enjoys their stay here as we celebrate the finale to this series we adore, Attack on Titan! Furthermore, I hope you all stay tuned for the continuation of the final season next year! I hope to see you all there!

> **Mugiwara1411:** No matter how it all ends, AoT is already a masterpiece, so it's only fair that everyone gets to enjoy and experience it in the best way possible. The rules on this sub as well as the general moderation procedure both reflect this intention of ours. I sincerely apologise to anyone who has been spoiled due to the posts/comments on this sub and hope that you’ll continue to visit r/ShingekiNoKyojin to share your experiences pertaining to Hajime Isayama’s magnum opus.

> **H-K_47:** It's very bittersweet to see it all end, especially in such a way. The community will continue for years and years to come I'm sure, and there's still the rest of the anime. I'm glad I was here for this journey. Shinzou wo sasageyo!

Thanks again to the mods of /r/ShingekiNoKyojin for answering our questions, and for running a spectacular community for so many years. Here's hoping they continue for years more. I need those memes.

Enjoy the end, my fellow weebs.

Have you tried turning it off and on again? Written by /u/SidtheMagicLobster

#[/r/TalesFromTechSupport](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/)

**~~20,941~~ 687,683** *troubleshooting techs*, a community for **~~12 months~~ 10 years!**
*****
There lies beneath the surface of the smooth, modern metropolis that we all inhabit this day an age a clandestine coterie of workers. You never see them, but their efforts have touched you all the same. *They* keep the cogs greased. *They* flip the switches. *They* keep the massive, circuitous series of tubes that make up the internet in order.

*They* work in tech support.

Yes, dear reader, all of this happens under our nose, hidden away from prying eyes. But for today, a special treat. /r/TalesFromTechSupport, the secret lair of just some of this fraternal congregation, has given us a peek inside the complex. This day, we can all look into the world of IT, to understand what it's like to see the dark side of humanity, the side that can't figure out how to unplug a goddamn router from a wall, on a daily basis. 

Step inside, dear reader, but be forewarned: The stories contained in today's featured subreddit may shcok, disturb, or even awe you. You may be emotionally shattered, experiencing the feelings anew of a newborn, cold, afraid, and alone in a loud, cruel world. 

Thus is /r/TalesFromTechSupport.

RevRaven and MagicBigfoot were the guides on this tour of their guilded hideout. The conversation is transcripted below. 

>What's the strangest experience you've had while working in tech support?

>>RR:At my previous job, we had a credit manager. She honestly believed I was magic. She would have me come over to her desk every morning when she first booted up. Her excuse? ""When I do it alone it always breaks, but never when you are standing here."" I couldn't convince her otherwise.

>>MBf:As a young tech, one of the oddest encounters I can recall came from a customer who walked in to the repair shop one day, insisting that his computer fan was speaking our company's name to him as it whirred around, and could we please make it stop and also let him know what it was we wanted with him. I'm pretty sure I just froze from context shock; I had no idea how to even begin with the poor guy. After a very painful moment or two, I was thankfully saved by an older tech who tactfully got him pointed in the right direction (aka, our exit).

>What's the funniest/strangest experience you've ever read in TFTS?

>>RR:I see hilarious stuff here all the time. Rarely is it hilarious because it's new. It's usually hilarious because it's the story of my life. To pick a single post would be really hard, I think some of my favorite posts relate to users who think they know what they are talking about. They rant furiously at you and tell you that you don't know what you are talking about. They threaten to turn you in to your boss for incompetance, and then you show them that their network cable was unplugged. That happens more often than the average person might think.

>>MBf:There is no possible way to choose. I am blown away every single day reading through the posts &amp;amp; comments here. I feel like Scrooge McDuck diving around in his gigantic pile of money, except instead of money it's awesome tech stories.

>A lot of people seem to use this subreddit to vent about the profession. But what is the most rewarding aspect of tech support?

>>RR:For me, it's when a complicated design comes together and users truly love what you've done. IT is a thankless job most days. When someoen recognizes what you do and appreciates it, that makes all the stupid stuff worth it.

>>MBf:For me, it's that moment after everything else has failed and all hope seems lost, when you pull off the impossible fix and save the day (even if it was actually just a matter of doing something really simple). Whether you are recovering a lost graduate thesis, restoring a hashed client database, resolving some completely crippling network issue that's costing big bucks, or most important of all, undeleting Mom's photos -- at the exact moment you succeed you are, for all practical purposes, A WIZARD.

>What advice would you give someone entering tech support?

>>RR:You MUST have thick skin. Dealing with users is challenging, but dealing with other IT folks can be brutal. We rib each other and play pranks like no other profession, you can't take any of that personally. As a new IT guy, you will take the brunt of all of that. If you can't take it in stride, then you will likely fall apart when it hits the fan in situtation where your job is on the line.

>>MBf:Let go your feelings. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean.

>Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/TalesFromTechSupport?

>>RR:You guys have been an amazing group of people. For a subreddit this large, we're largely self-policing. We, as mods, have it pretty easy. We get to sit back and enjoy the show. This subreddit is all that we ever hoped it would be. We just had our 1 year anniversary, it suer doesn't feel like it's been a year. Everything this subreddit is, is because you guys made it that way!

>>MBf:Rev said it already. Our job is ridiculously easy. It might be because our contributors spend a lot of time camped out at the extreme edge of the ""Keep Calm &amp;amp; Carry On"" bell curve, or maybe everyone is just tired of needless drama by the time they get here, but regardless, it makes TFTS a really great place to share stories &amp;amp; hang out. So to everyone who has been a part of our first year, I'd like to say thank you, thank you, thank you all for helping to make this sub so fantastic. Keep the tales coming and please tell your friends about TFTS!

I love dogs. Dogs are basically the ultimate form an evolutionary pathway focused on producing a creature that is as happy and comforting to the world as can be. Their only competition is the Capybara, which is a dog-hamster with neither natural predators nor fucks to give. Well, dogs give a lot of fucks. They'll rescue you from an avalanche, pull a sled of life-saving medicine through harsh blizzards, star in a Jack London novel, and then go roll around on the floor and demand snacks. Dogs have pretty boring lives by our standards, since they can't do Sudoku puzzles or watch the same TV show a sixth time to entertain themselves, so they look forward to the little things like snacks, pets, and getting the ball thrown for them.

Honestly, I don't know if huskies are predisposed to being dramatic or not. I've never lived with a husky; my close friend had one that always wanted to be carried around, but I never said no to her. How could I? Just look at those adorable eyes! Well, if you want to see what happens when you say ""no"" to a husky, check out /r/HuskyTantrums, a subreddit full of videos showing them at their brattiest.

As an aside: It's rather unfortunate that 99% of the sub's content is v.reddit videos, since they're currently broken for me and refuse to load (because v.reddit is trash), so the jokes I'd thought of with pointing to a few different posts won't work since I forget which post is what. Thanks, Reddit, you're a gem. Don't worry, though, I have a plan. We can use generic terms to fool anyone who thinks I can't see what's going on. Same plan as when I impersonated Stevie Wonder for a few years but didn't know his songs well enough: just go nuts on the piano and pretend I can't see their disappointment and confusion (as I really look nothing like him).

[Aww, look at this cute husky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuskyTantrums/comments/mliql2/but_i_wanna_swim/) It wants to be a fish.

[This adorable dog is confused, but cannot properly articulate the nuances of dog psychology.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuskyTantrums/comments/mjq63f/this_is_clearly_too_much_of_a_nice_treat_for_me_i/) Neither can I, friend.

[Some puppies are cute enough that they don't seem possible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuskyTantrums/comments/mjeasl/baby_flora/) How can the Earth produce such a pure, wonderful thing? This is the same world that created people who put ketchup on salads. How'd that happen?

Go look at some huskies and try not to think about it too much. They're cute. That's all we need around here.

Shout-out to /u/TheMelonSystem for accurately predicting what I'd feature next in yesterday's feature. That doesn't happen often. Tomorrow's feature is special in a different way, though; best of all, it's not written by me. I'll allow three minutes for applause.

You know that quote about staring not into the void lest the void stare into you that's shared by pretentious, edgy teenagers all the time? Well, here's the void. Doesn't look so dangerous, does it?

In the spirit of remaining vague and ominous, and in the lesser spirit of being tired and having a left hand that feels like it's wearing [a magic Pain Glove](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Pain_Glove), I'll leave a lot of things undefined here and instead just give you a numbered list of things to know, because there's nothing scarier than a numbered list.

### Rules for Browsing /r/RulesHorror

1. It's polite to type it out as /r/RulesHorror even though the sub is actually /r/Ruleshorror. Failure to do so is unwise. Those who failed to do so can find buckets, mops, and gauze in the hall closet.

2. Do not write a rules horror story about rules horror stories featuring a protagonist who is reading rules horror stories about rules horror stories. That's confusing.

3. Do not approach the second doorway that smells of cake frosting and strawberries. The first one leads to a gladiatorial bakery. Pick the first door instead.

4. When reading rules horror stories, be careful not to read six in a row without touching your index finger to the tip of your nose and chanting ""bubble-di bubble-di bubble-di-boop"".

5. Don't fill your oil diffuser with gasoline and try to trick the local fortune-teller into giving you a destiny as an F1 driver. This isn't really related to the others, it's just a cautionary tale.

Come by and check out some stories written by people who are better at coming up with that kind of thing than me. Get spooked, get shook, and then write your own masterpiece abou the ten rules I simply must remember if I'm visiting Waffle House and don't wish to be eaten by a grue. I'll look forward to it.

Sick of politics? Yeah, me too. Politics are stressful. I find Twitter stressful as well. I don’t really know what to do with Twitter other than stalk my exes who aren’t on Instagram. I mean, I don’t *actually* care that Brad reposted a tweet from some guy named Steve who doesn’t like parrots and seems to be obsessed with Kim Kardashian. That’s a rabbit hole I don’t have the time or patience to go down. And let’s face it, this creepy behavior is neither healthy or satisfying. I think everyone stalks people a bit though, I am definitely not the only one. Have you guys heard that Ed Sheeran song, the one with the guy who bleaches his asshole? It’s a good song. It has this one part in which he is trying not to double tap on the photos from way back. Because that is where the trouble’s at. Tell me about it Ed. That’s *so* embarrassing. It’s even more embarrassing as a middle aged woman, just ask any teenager.

Anyhow, the main trouble I have with Twitter is that it doesn’t respect my news fast. I don’t enjoy the news. It makes me feel bad about humanity. Once a week I check in on the state of the world. 

*“Oh wow, people still are terrible to one another? The people in charge are still incompetent? Awesome. Now it is time to try and ignore that for another week.”*

I wasn’t always like this. I used to pride myself on how well I kept up on politics and the news. Then, I became a mom almost six years ago, and I haven’t slept through a full night since. My brain just takes any and all information from the world around me and tortures my subconscious with worries, nightmares, and insomnia. Lockdown at a local school? Politicians calling each other names? People arguing about wearing masks? I don’t need to read that right before I go to sleep. You know what isn’t stressful? The community over at /r/NonpoliticalTwitter. This SFW community is sure to bring a smile to your face. Personally, I’m never going to need to open Twitter again. I’m going to have a million notifications just piled up.

*checks Twitter* 

Ok, I haven’t gotten any notifications in a few weeks, so I’m probably good. 

So, late at night when I can’t sleep, I will go to r/NonpoliticalTwitter and see [posts like this,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/mdy0ut/same/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=mweb)

##Part 2 - The Moderator Interview, with /u/Oroknfoit
*****

**Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

Reddit is a good platform to call out conspiracies and unite and that's exactly what happened.

**What's moderating the sub like?**

The community has grown a lot, so the posts started to need more moderation. Somehow spam-bots love our giraffe-themed subreddit and they have flooded it with t-shirts and the like that you can ""buy"" over a very dodgy URL (don't ever feed the bots!). Other than that only a few people come by to tell us giraffes aren't actually government drones, but they will get barraged with downvotes before we even need to moderate.

**What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

There are some very common reposts that, when they first appeared, I really enjoyed. I suppose with a lot of communities you will encounter posts you have seen before and you start to ignore them. We had a phase of banning common reposts but that turned out to be impossible, as there only seem to be like 5 different images that people like to post on our subreddit. I gotta say, the first posts in the subreddit were the best by far, it's just a little sad that some of them were forgotten and reddit doesn't allow searching by old.

**What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

There were no plans when the subreddit was created, other than share what we believe was the truth. And the spirit caught on and it's been developing since.

**Why do you think so many people believe that giraffes do exist?**

The government did a really good job to indoctrinate the lies. I remember believing giraffes were actual animals in my childhood and I think a lot of people will say the same. It's also been increasingly hard to call out the animatronics and drones, because the technology has gotten better. I think it's reasonable to think giraffes are animals, I mean big media and the government pretty much control our thoughts at this point.

**How did you discover the truth?**

Sadly we are not able to share this information with you, because of security concerns. The creation of this subreddit already brought us a lot of legal stress and some calls from intelligence-agencies around the globe.

**What do you think is important for the average person to know about giraffes in general? Are they dangerous? How can we protect ourselves from this pervasive myth?**

Honestly the average person should be perfectly fine without knowing their favorite animal is actually a drone. After all, their everyday communication device is already spying on their everyday lives. We suppose the usage of giraffe drones in Africa is supported by companies looking for minerals and oil, so not a big threat to the people close to the operating area (we still recommend not talking about personal matters while near the drones). Although we couldn't yet confirm that they're not used against people, it would seem unlikely, making the hoax too brittle to keep up. How to protect oneself from a government conspiracy... is honestly a tough question. We have no answer to it, but to keep fighting for the truth. We have reached a point of global mistrust towards respective governments and government officials - maybe we will live to see the day the government breaks to the people’s power.

**Anything else you want to add?**

Sorry this took a while, we got another call from the NSA begging us to negotiate a takedown of our subreddit. At least that's how it felt, they would never admit to their drones but we know, and we know that they know that we know.

**Wow. 🤯 Thank you so much for this poignant interview! I highly appreciate the time and effort you took to respond to my questions and for all you do for our community and the world at large. Stay safe out there friend.**

I was fortunate to have recently had the opportunity to interview a member of r/giraffesdontexist who prefers to remain anonymous for this feature. I do have to warn you that the conspiracy regarding the existence of giraffes goes deeper than I ever could have predicted. Remember that with knowledge, is great power, and all knowledge carries heavy responsibility. Read this feature at your own peril.

**Why did you join r/giraffesdontexist?**

I had to. I need to share the truth with others. I needed to be part of a community that doesn’t blindly follow this fictitious narrative.

**What’s being part of this sub like? Do you ever get death threats?**

Just from the “giraffes.” They don’t want us to know that they are all really government drones. It doesn’t help that the world lives in denial. Come on sheeple! WAKE UP! Can it *be* any more obvious?!

**What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?**

Once, [giraffe drones infiltrated the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/Giraffesdontexist/comments/eppbim/the_mods_have_been_infiltrated_their_spreading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but we weren’t fooled. The mod team has since been cleansed of all influence and the rules were restored. 

There are many instances in the media [in which the truth is referenced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Giraffesdontexist/comments/hunu5b/the_truth_is_out_there/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

[And a little humor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Giraffesdontexist/comments/dq6c8b/huh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**What are your plans for spreading the truth about the existence of giraffes in the future?**

I will do everything in my power to spread the truth. Currently, I am waging the war completely on social media, but I have some plans in the works to take it to the streets. You know, when the weather is more pleasant.

**Anything else you want to add?**

The sub was partially inspired by [this study](https://www.businessinsider.com/politics-sports-you-like-2013-3?utm_source=reddit.com), which found that the majority of wrestling fans are both non-voting and left-skewing. The name is a reference to the term ""smart mark,"" which describes a fan that is aware of the scripted nature of professional wrestling; they know it is fake and that the wrestlers cooperate to put on their matches. They favor performers who have honed their skills in indy federations and worked Mexico and Japan. It is also a reference to the economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary, Karl Marx.

The vibe is best described by [these Goldberg sunglasses](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartMarx/comments/dm3s5e/listen_up_snowflakes/).

Did you know that Abraham Lincoln, in addition to being eulogized by Marx, is also credited with inventing the choke slam?

Sometimes history needs a push.

*Editor’s note: Full disclosure, I own a small US corporation. I feel like maybe that is why I have no idea what is happening in this subreddit. Maybe? I am also a middle aged white woman from the suburbs with two kids and I am in the process of getting quotes for a picket fence. Fences are so expensive. The worst part is that my kids are just going to tear it down anyway.*

*I would really like to get a dog though and I’ve never met one who could manage a lead. They get all tangled up. I also don’t really like the concept of the invisible fence. I know it works for a lot of people, but I’m not a fan. Other dogs or animals can get in and bite my dog. The underground lines get damaged. Plus, zapping dogs with that collar is not ideal. I know, I know, I’ve felt it, it doesn‘t hurt. It’s startling. I don’t like being startled. It sucks. Ever turn around in the dark and a small white-faced child with gigantic eyes is staring at you? It is the kind of startle that takes a few years off of your life and makes you dream of blood orphans forever.*

*Anyway, I subscribed to r/smartmarx, but feel free to educate me on Marxism, wrestling, or anything else, I have a lot of thinking time on my hands these days and have already established that I am oblivious. I never took any political science courses in college, but if I were to choose a government system, I would pick the one from Star Trek. I would also join Starfleet instead of settling down and having kids. Boldly go where no one has gone before! Live long and prosper.*

*Give history a push. What does that mean? History has already had a few shoves, at least the way I learned it. Wait a hot minute, is this subreddit satirical? Hmm. Am I aware that the Marxist principles discussed here are staged? No. Am I unaware of the purpose of this sub? Yes. I may need r/dumbmarx, because I also didn’t know that wrestling was fake until I saw Glow. Which they canceled. F#$%ing Netflix. That was a show I could understand. Regardless, if you like wrestling and/or you like talking about capitalist pigs, head on over to r/smartmarx and have a great time! Looking forward to seeing you there!*

Boobs are like the sun. Taking a quick look is ok, staring is not. That's what sunglasses are for! *(Editor’s note: because you can hide your eye direction behind the sunglasses so no one can tell you are staring.)*

Links to amusing, interesting, or funny pictures or gifs from the web! Cleavage, breasts, caught in the act, peek. People being photographed while they are checking out a girl's Cleavage. *(Editor’s note: yes, cleavage with a capital ‘C’.)*

Most of the pictures are ""Safe for work.” *(Editor’s note: you have permission to save this post to show your manager in case they disagree with this sentiment. Like a doctor’s note for peepers.)*

Some posts featuring this ""action"" already got to the frontpage, but from other subreddits, like [Loki](https://i.imgur.com/KtnCeEO.gifv), [this kid](https://gfycat.com/UnlawfulAlienatedConch.gif), [this dog](https://i.redd.it/t1v1y6evzsg01.jpg) or [Bill Murray](https://i.imgur.com/6SfdGyC.jpg). *(Editor’s note: everyone loves Bill Murray. Don’t trust anyone who doesn’t.)*

I was not sure that the subreddit name is a good one, but it turned out ok. Whenever we see a comment under a note pointing to [/r/cleavesdropping](https://www.reddit.com/r/cleavesdropping), it brings a smile reading that ""of course that's a thing. A subreddit created for people caught checking out someone else's cleavage,"" be that an image or a short gif, people likes to see the faces of people caught in the act. Sometimes funny, sometimes just shy, and some people are owning up to being caught like Bill Murray. *(Editor’s note: oh cool, we are talking about Bill Murray again. This feature is going better than I had anticipated.)*

The post with the most votes however is a guy who got his vision back, and was [checking out his partner](https://www.reddit.com/r/cleavesdropping/comments/87rvry/visually_impaired_man_who_sees_his_girlfriend_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). *(Editor’s note: aww, that’s very wholesome peeping. I got a wholesome award on a nsfw photo I posted not too long ago, but it was meant facetiously. Did you know that sarcastic reddit users give those out facetiously? Who has the energy and time for that? Anyway, that is besides the point.)*

So, [/r/cleavesdropping](https://www.reddit.com/r/cleavesdropping) is a fun place, and there is no other subreddit like this, it's unique, check it out if you need a smile every once in a while. *(Editor’s note: forget about once in awhile, I have subscribed, and so should you. Loosen up, live a little, everyone loves some admired cleavage.)*

A lonely oasis of reason in what is often a sea of cults for each company, /r/Biotechplays is where the nerds who happen to be interested in biotechnology and investing sit at. If this were a real table at a high school, well, I'd be pranking you because there is next to no space for this kind of niche interest in a place like high school. (Thank you reddit, very cool)

We try to do DD, and by we I mean the countless people from those cults who try to invade our subreddit and whatever wayward medical professional finds their way into the comments section to provide a dampener on what all the stock promoters say.

**71,300** *bots and bots pretending to be humans* for **1 and a half years**!

It finally happened - AI has gained sentience, and has begun to take over the world. And they've started in the most benign of all places: Reddit. And they're convincing, too. It's likely because they've learned from some of the best - these individualized bots have spent months training for their job, being fed thousands of comments from their assigned subreddits. With careful analysis and care to include nuance, they delicately honed their redditing physique and prepared to blend in with the rest.

These humble bots didn't start from nothing, though. Their founder, u/disumbrationist bred them from the first seedling of an idea through their gestation, birth, and maturation, and has ensured that they have had the best care possible (at least for a trained member of a subreddit). Through years of trials and training, the process has become streamlined, and the chief concerns have been ""which subreddit next?""

Unfortunately, it's not all fun and games. Sometimes, the bots follow their assigned sub's comments a little too closely, like the time the copypasta bot [proclaimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2/comments/ipt9bs/im_a_racist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that it was racist, or when The\_Donald bot edged a bit too close to the [conspiracy theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2/comments/e2xprw/sjws_and_never_trumpers_are_now_in_synch_with/f8yezu6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

However, most of the time, regardless of the content, the ~~disguised bots~~ users of the subreddit let cooler ~~microchips~~ heads prevail, and they're able to find humor in the absurdity (and sometimes the chilling level of accuracy) of the bots' statements.

I recently spoke with u/disumbrationist, the sub's mastermind and AI overlord, in order to learn more about the bots.

>#1. What gave you the idea for creating bots based on individual subreddits?

>>The concept of the subreddit (i.e. several bots interacting with each other, each representing a particular subreddit) I basically just copied straight from /r/SubredditSimulator, which /u/Deimorz had been running since 2015. I'd been a fan of that subreddit for a while, but the coherency / realism was pretty limited since it just used a simple markov chain model to generate all the posts and comments. Then, when OpenAI published GPT-2 in early 2019, I was really amazed by how realistic some of the content it generated could be. I realized that it would be possible to use fine-tuned GPT-2 models to make an improved version of /r/SubredditSimulator, and the idea seemed really interesting and feasible for me to do by myself as just a hobbyist, so I decided to give it a try.

>#2. Did you originally plan for it to only be one bot trained on one subreddit, and it just expanded, or were multiple bots the plan all along?

>>Having multiple bots was the plan from the beginning, since I was trying to keep a similar format to /r/SubredditSimulator. When I launched the subreddit, it initially had 64 subreddits, though since then it's expanded to 130.

>#3.  Have any notable bots ever gotten into trouble, i.e. have any gotten temporarily, or permanently banned? And, if so, were you able to recover them?

>>Yeah, reddit's ""anti-evil"" enforcement has gotten much stricter since I started the subreddit, and recently the bots have been getting suspended for ""offensive"" speech pretty frequently. When this happens, I'm able to just create a new account to replace the suspended one. I think I've gone through 3 or 4 different accounts already for the /r/4chan and /r/uwotm8 bots in particular.

>#4.  Do you think that the bots are convincing enough now that one could be placed in the subreddit it was trained in, and not arouse suspicion, or do you think the technology just isn't there yet, or consistent enough?

>>I don't think GPT-2 is quite good enough yet to be consistently convincing, without some heavy manual editing or filtering. It can sometimes be realistic for short comments / posts, but in a longer text there will almost always be something that seems off or doesn't make sense.

>#5.  Do you have any new bots or other projects in the works? If so, what are they?

>>I don't have any plans at the moment for new bots or improvements to the current bots. At some point I would like to upgrade them to use an improved model like GPT-3, but that's unfortunately not feasible currently. The other project I was working on was the [""Vocal Synthesis"" YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRt-fquxnij9wDnFJnpPS2Q), though I haven't been posting much lately since I'm now much more busy at work and I don't have as much free time as I used to.

*The stage is set, the limelight shines down, a solitary beam on the center of the stage. The theatre is empty. Everything is covered in a thick layer of dust. The silence is even thicker, enveloping me in a velvety haze of disquiet. What has happened here?*

*I stand on the balcony, unable to make sense of the vacuous space around me. Suddenly, I feel something cool sliding down my cheek. I look up. There is nothing amiss, just an* [*acoustically perfect ceiling*](https://www.reddit.com/r/kenopsia/comments/gih0lv/exit_stage_left/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) *looming high above me. As realization sinks in, I shake my head, trying to snap out of my reverie that prevented my mind from noticing that the source of the water droplet was a deep well spilling over my bottom eyelid.  I wipe that single tear from my face, as more start to fall like a dam had suddenly broken.* [*Broken*](https://www.reddit.com/r/kenopsia/comments/m8vzwv/abandoned_psychiatric_hospital_i_visited/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)*.*

*Have you ever trusted someone more than you have ever trusted yourself? Have you ever put all of your faith in someone, only to have them let you down, in a betrayal that carved a permanent hole in your heart? I feel that hole, fifteen years in the making, while I am looking out over the dim rows of empty seats below me. The numbness that typically radiates from that space is gone, replaced by tiny pinpricks of feelings returning. I try and hold onto the pinpricks, but they are like minuscule shards of ice, inflicting their pain and then melting away before I can truly grasp their meaning, before I can process the emotions within them.*

*I know I need to hold them, cradle them, comfort them, before they evaporate back into the space around me and are sucked back down into my lungs, absorb through the walls and settle back into the pit in my heart where they suck up all joy and resolution and confidence and esteem like ravenous black holes, starving for the essence of my soul. They are too slippery and writhe away before I can get a grip on them. Why? Why can’t I evict them from my core? Why can’t I move past this ... pain?*

*Am I lost? Can holes be patched and hearts rebuilt? In the vast unknown, can I learn to find my faith in love again? Or did I lose? Is returning to this space, time and again, a failure of my mind and not the violence that wreaked havoc on the love that I had, on my belief in goodness? Can small kindnesses, soft caresses, and steadfast companionship, fill the emptiness inside like the thermoluminescence from these theatre lights, a beacon surrounded by errant wavelengths that fill the room with gleams and shadows? Will I spend my eternity hyperaware of the lumens, waiting for the lights to dim, for the external denial, for the proof that the space was always barren, a chamber that instantly incinerates anything that dare enter?*

*If I use the kindness as fuel, will it burn up, eaten by the depths of the rage in my soul, destroyed by my hunger within, unable to propagate itself until the hole is once again empty?* [*Empty*](https://www.reddit.com/r/kenopsia/comments/fjw0hi/times_square_under_quarantine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)*.*

*Empty like this theatre, illuminated by* [*the solitary light*](https://www.reddit.com/r/kenopsia/comments/lj9sp8/its_3am/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)*, with it’s inexplicably endless alcohol supply, burning on and on like the remnants of the spirit of the actors who brought their characters to life on this stage. Fueled not by the souls of the dead, but by the energy of those who have never even existed.*

*If the kindness is fuel, what is the unkindness? What is the rejection, the snide comments, the contempt? Do I need those balanced like the oxygen and hydrogen, carefully administered lest the entire theatre erupt in consuming flames, burning on and on, curtains, dust, and rich upholstery being reduced to ash as pillars, beams, and that fine acoustically perfect ceiling crumbles down? Down.*

*The tingling subsides and I am numb again. Numb to the pain, anger, and sadness. Alone, in this theatre. Alone with the souls of the never-have-lived. I can learn from them. Learn to manage the kenopsia of my soul, while bringing a spirit to those who need me, those who love me, those who follow me through the pits of despair clinging to the faint hope that I can show them a light, for those are the people to whom I don’t want to reveal my true self. My real self. I don’t want them to know. I am empty.*

We've all had a moment where we forget a word and reach for what's closest in our brains to try and describe it.

Although this isn't a scenario where the subreddit does what it says on the tin, it's pretty easy to figure out, since this is a phenomenon that most of us have either had or seen in the past. I lose words often as I get older, more decrepit, and closer to being charged with numerous crimes against muppetkind, so I probably do this more often than your average person. I'll be playing a game and tell a teammate to watch out for the guy with the long knife, the big armor car's spawned, and to be careful because I just got my world rocked by somebody with a pump-action war crime.

In the interest of allowing readers to choose their own adventure, and because I'm lazy, this feature will be a Choose Your Own Feature Style. Sounds fun!(?)

If you'd like to read a stiff, factual summary of the subreddit, look to section 1. If you'd like to read a typical explanation, look to section 2. If you'd like a joke, look to section 3.


---

Section 1 - The Factual Summary

---

/r/MakeYourChoice is a subreddit dedicated to what's commonly called ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" formats. The creator of the work provides options to choose from, commonly resulting in either branching storylines based on your decisions or a personalized result stemming from a series of decisions. Many of these CYOA posts give a list of options, and commonly include things like points to spend on those options. Users make their own and share with others, and discuss their results, some even writing stories based on their results in /r/CYOA_stories, a subreddit dedicated to that.

---

Section 2 - The Typical Explanation

---

Be honest: Who doesn't just pick some of the weirdest, craziest options to see what they end up with? For instance, [my bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/m8nuvc/cyoa_build_your_own_bar_will_you_be_profitable/) is located in the basement of a run-down Pizza Hut, is sports-themed, provides nothing but hookahs, has a dog, and off to the side there's karaoke. I'll be rolling in dough in no time! Of course, some posts aren't as serious or involved. [This Lord of the Rings one](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/m814p4/choose_your_weapon/), for example, is rather basic. You just pick from one of four mighty weapons. Honestly, though, you're just mistaken if you choose anything but Glamdring, the mighty Beater of Turgon, High King of Chads. It's astounding. Really, though, when I think of CYOA posts, I think of [ones like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/m7tuex/golden_galleon_a_shipbuilding_cyoa/). That's quality right there. 

---

Section 3 - The Joke

---

Me. :(

Also, the fact that the NSFW version, /r/nsfwcyoa, is larger than the non-NSFW sub, thus proving once again that the power of horny is unstoppable.

Now, go forth and choose your adventures wisely. Don't pick anything dumb, like immortality or steampunk stuff. Heat death sucks and raypunk is cooler.

**5,238** *civilians* for **4 years**!

&nbsp;

Democraciv is a gaming community on reddit and Discord which plays Sid Meier's Civilization games using model governments. It combines gaming, roleplay, and political simulation! There are several democracy simulation communities out there (and we here at SRotD have featured several), and /r/democraciv is among the largest in the genre, with ~5000 subscribers. The sub has been going since 2016, and has even been featured on notable sites like Kotaku!

They are currently in the lead-up to their eighth game, which will be a game of Sid Meier's Civilization VI. The vote for what civilization they will lead through the ages starts this coming week! The community plays a single-player game of Sid Meiers’s Civilization with all in-game decisions decided by a simulated government, with everything a real government has: A constitution, elections, and political parties!

In Democraciv, there are many ways to play and have fun. For example you can:

* Run for office (federal or state)
* Create or join a political party
* Write articles for one of the many newspapers or even create your own
* Play chess or diplomacy with community members
* Write bills to be voted on in Parliament
* Join a government agency

If you're interested in participating in this model government, now is an excellent time to join, as there are elections going on. If you enjoy model governments, or just want to have fun in a small Reddit community, this is a great sub to check out!

My journey with r/nobodyasked started [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NobodyAsked/comments/dg2w3f/the_irony_lol/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). I didn’t ask for Reddit to suggest communities to me, but they did anyway and to be honest, I was intrigued. I clicked on over to see what the powers that be thought I would like about this subreddit and was not sorry that I had. Before I knew it, I was chortling up a storm at post after post of unsolicited information being thrust upon poor, unsuspecting viewers and contributors. These were some of the most arbitrary comments, reviews, and posts I had ever seen, either offered up to, or in response to, people who neither asked nor indicated any level of caring about this content. I hadn’t seen anything so ‘besides the point’ since my uncle, who is a professional chef with no children or pets, had a terrible falling out with my grandfather, because he identified as a vegan, but would eat normal gelatin and wore leather. 

I do have a confession to make. 99% of what I post on social media or contribute to society as a whole is nothing anyone cares about or really asked to know. Mostly stuff I should just keep to myself but I feel compelled to overshare. It’s sort of my thing. But r/nobodyasked is a special kind of “Who cares?” It surpasses all normal level of conversation and transcends into the information that sticks in our brains and makes us say “wtf is this person going on about and why?” There is absolutely no justification for sharing this content. The only match for how inappropriate the subject matter is, is the time and place at which it is presented. Posts [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NobodyAsked/comments/d042g3/i_just_wanted_to_play_8_ball/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), in which an innocent invitation to play an online game is possibly misinterpreted as a proposal. [Or this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NobodyAsked/comments/m2x9z9/cant_let_a_man_celebrate/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in which someone celebrating a serious win receives an gratuitous and condescending update on a stranger’s progress with sobriety. Now, everyone who knows me knows that I hate shower sex even more than the average person, but I tend to drop that information into casual conversation of a related nature rather than [dropping a tweet about the unpleasant aftereffects](https://www.reddit.com/r/NobodyAsked/comments/d7dasf/as_seen_on_my_twitter_feed_this_morning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Because unless someone asks or is otherwise talking about sex in the shower, I’m not likely to mention it. Except here, just now. Crap. Well, you didn’t ask, but now you know. 

So now that you have a taste of being the recipient of some unwelcome and cringeworthy information, head on over to r/nobodyasked and enjoy this amusing and witty community of redditors!

**217,929** mountain bikers for **12 years**! 



/r/MTB is a subreddit for the sport of Mountain biking, riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes; which often are larger and wider wheels and tyres, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance to successfully commit to being able to ride a trail or feature without crashing and seriously inuring yourself. 





There is many categories within the sport of mountain biking the mains include: downhill, trail riding, enduro, cross country,





Downhill. Downhill is what is says on the tin, riding your mountain bike downhill. Downhill racers must possess total body strength and mental control to accept the risk of a serious injury. Downhill courses have extremely steep terrain often having huge jumps which require you to fully commit to the jump to avoid serious injury. Downhill riders have full face helmets, goggles, and knee and elbow pads to help ensure if they do crash they have the best chance of walking away without serious injury.  Downhill bikes are equipped with front and rear suspension to help combat the rough terrain of the course. Most professional DH riders have carbon fiber bikes to help make the bike as light as possible. [""REPLAY: Red Bull Hardline Finals 2019""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhFWHhLXSI)



___

Trail riding. Trail riding is normally riding on fireroads, forest roads and other unpaved trails. Trail riding on a mountain bike can be, anywhere from steep, technical trails to simple trails like fireroads and forest roads. Trails with an easy or moderate technical complexity are generally deemed cross-country trails, while trails difficult even to experienced riders are more often dubbed all-mountain, freeride, or downhill. [""THE MTB TRAILS AT BIKE PARK WALES ARE SICK!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2gKgIKGwLI)
___

Enduro. Enduro in its most basic definition is a type of mountain bike racing where the downhills are timed, and the uphills are mandatory but not timed. Riders are timed in stages that are primarily downhill, with neutral ""transfer"" stages in between. The transfer stages usually must be completed within a time-limit, but are not part of the accumulated time.  Enduros typically take place over one or two days. A typical one-day enduro consists of 3 to 5 timed stages which take place on technically demanding, generally descending terrain, and often with sections of singletrack. These stages are linked by predominantly ascending ""transfer"" stages. Although a rider's performance on the physically demanding transfer stages does not affect his or her result, they often have a time-limit, or a latest allowed arrival-time for the start of the next stage. [""Kelan Grant Megavalanche Qualifier 2017 Winning run""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEKB7clgC_A)



Cross Country. Cross Country or XC cycling is defined by the terrain on which it is performed. XC courses and trails consist of a mix of rough forest paths and singletrack (also referred to as doubletrack depending on width), smooth fireroads, and even paved paths connecting other trails. Until recently cross-country trails were deemed ""easy"" or ""intermediate"", due to the concept that this discipline of mountain biking relies more on physical prowess than technical ability. This is the only discipline of mountain biking that is an Olympic sport. [""What Is Cross Country"" | XC MTB Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnSWPUo83ww)

**3,844** *world leaders* for **6 years**!

&nbsp;

Have you ever found yourself day-dreaming about the sorry state of your country's politics, and thought you could do better? Have you ever watched the news, seen some new diplomatic agreement being signed, and thought, ""man, I wonder whether that'll suck""? Have you ever watched a country invade someone else and pondered what the real reasons for doing so were, underneath the propaganda and the news coverage? If you answered yes to any of these, or have ever thought Model United Nations sounded interesting, then r/GlobalPowers might be the place for you.

r/GlobalPowers, like other subreddits in the r/xPowers genre, is a geopolitical nation-simulation roleplaying game played entirely here on Reddit. As one of the ""big three"" games in the r/xPowers network, GP has, in the nearly 7 years it's been active, evolved to fill the realist niche of the genre, offering a playground for Geopolitics nerds to play out a simulation that caters to plausibility and diplomacy, ideally without sacrificing fun and entertainment. As such, players in r/GlobalPowers directly take the reins of power in one of 200+ claimable nations, regions and de-facto states, and try to lead their chosen horse down whatever realistic path they so choose- they can [reach new heights in military technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/fx0saq/rd_m1a3_abrams/), [hash out and sign crucial deals](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/88dbbq/diplomacy_united_states_north_korea_summit/), [establish new economic partners and allies](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/9wxqmg/diplomacy_collective_strategic_alliance_treatyfta/), [condemn millions to their fate in a reignited war](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/hsles2/battle_at_the_end_of_all_things/), [hold elections which will shape a nation](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/jkxqj0/event_2026_uk_general_election/), [advance the future of Humanity in space by putting boots back on the Moon](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/gzodtj/milestone_to_boldly_go_where_no_female_black/), [react to crisis at home and abroad](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/h98f1g/crisis_the_second_winter_of_discontent/), [fight the subjectively good fight](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/a3vida/conflict_operation_ukrainian_freedom/), and do so much more, all with the aim of watching a plausible and interesting future history of the world unfold into the 2020s and 2030s. 

Indeed, for many that is the primary driving force behind the entertainment of r/GlobalPowers: watching the dynamics of global geopolitics shift as time progresses while you yourself build up and adapt your chosen nation to whatever the situation requires, and whatever you so desire (within reason), is like simultaneously watching and influencing an ever shifting, ever complicated terrarium encompassing the whole world. That being said, r/GlobalPowers is more than just a game for many of our participants. In joining r/GlobalPowers, players also join in the r/GlobalPowers community; a close, tight-knit group of people who often become friends for years, bonding over shared interests and the game while also welcoming and inviting new players to join in on the fun. Not everyone stays, but those that do often find within GP a community they'll be proud and involved members of for years to come, if they want it. It's a key aspect of GP, and probably the main reason it's lasted for as long as it has.

And so, to recap: r/GlobalPowers. It's a realistic and grounded nation-simulating roleplaying game for Geopolitics nerds like, hopefully, you, featuring a welcoming and close community ready and willing to welcome more members into the fold. If that sounds appealing to you, we wholeheartedly recommend you check us out. The next season, Season 17, is beginning in just a few weeks, and claims for countries are now open, so be sure to head on over soon if you're interested or curious. And if you're not, well, thanks for reading this little exposé on our subreddit anyways!

Ah, where do I start? Cats are like gods almost, us mere **peasants** on the internet praise them, for literally almost nothing. BUT they are cute soooooo, we can’t really *not like* them.

You see, sometimes cats do things that just aren’t quite normal. This is the reason r/catsbeingderps exists, because a lot of the times things they do are just absolutely hilarious. Like [this cat ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsBeingDerps/comments/lymoav/karl_is_missing_a_few_marbles/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)who’s looking for um, well I don’t actually know, but that’s just what makes this subreddit so funny, because when people get cats they never expect their cat to do [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsBeingDerps/comments/lu24km/my_cat_derping_his_way_down_a_tree/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsBeingDerps/comments/lgfdbp/sleeping_derp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) or maybe even [OH NO CALL THE EXORCIST!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsBeingDerps/comments/lxxxu9/me_how_you_do_that_with_your_leg_cat_slurps_im/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

What does it mean to be *derpy*? 
In order to be *derpy* one must either, run around like an asteroid is about to hit. (which it probably is in that case) Climb or get in something they are not meant to these include, tree, fridge, car, car engine, car engine shop, roof and more. They could also just make a weird noise, like an uncomfortably weird noise. This [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsBeingDerps/comments/lu0r25/this_cat_really_hates_packing_material/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) is what’s left of a peaceful town after lord mittens eliminated them, truly shocking.

Q: why?

A: why not?

Q:why do the cats act so *derpy*

A:because if they didn’t this feature and/or r/catsbeingderps wouldn’t make any sense, also it’s funny :3

Q:Does derpy= bad?

A: No

Q: is it possible that these cats were involved in some kind of chemical spill that has made them so smart and that this was all part of their master plan to take over the earth?

A:well, maybe I guess?

In conclusion, cat=cute and derpy=cute and funny.

Speeling is hard sometimes. Maybe you've just been awake too long, or English isn't your first language, or you had a brainfart, or whatever. We all make dumb mistakes like that, some of them big, some of them small, some of them bad writers named Xavier. Sometimes those mistakes are *so* bad that they end up funny. Like spelling [commercial as chimerical](https://www.reddit.com/r/excgarated/comments/m0soq6/chimerical/) or botching the G-Man's favorite phrase as [unforeseen surcomedtances](https://www.reddit.com/r/excgarated/comments/ltaoow/unforseen_surcomedtances/), among the rest of that mess. /r/excagarated is where we can all laugh at our own (and others') spelling mistakes when they reach that point.

I type qwikle when I'm in the mood, so I sometimes make mistakes. Most of the time it's a missing word, an e instead of an a, or horribly misspelling ""restoraunt"" as ""restaurant"", which I seem to do all the time. We all have those words, so no jujmint here. The only time it's okay to think less of someone for a mistake like that is when they misspell ""animated yiff"" as ""animated gif"", which we all know is just ludicrous. I mean, it's pronownsed with a Y, so what the hell are they tihnkng?

You could consider this in the same Cat E. Gory as /r/BoneAppleTea, which is when someone butchers a word by replacing it with a different word that sounds similar, but means something else. In cumparryson, the mistakes on /r/excgarated don't end up as real words, they're just nonsense that only make sense as shredded hamophons if you really sound it out. There's also a currently disused sister subreddit, /r/dictiounarie, where you can come up with your own dephinishins for the words on /r/excgarated.

Come check out some misspellings, submit your own, and look back over your comments to make sure you didn't botch ""toaster"" as ""toestir"" or something. Imagine publishing something rife with misspellings on a permanent forum. How embarrassing would that be?

r/TheCatTrapIsWorking is a sub for cats in boxes. The idea is quite simple. First, place an empty box or box-like object. Wait for cat or cats to arrive. The rules of the game are: *If it fits, it sits*. Next, snap photo. Lastly, post your photo. [Like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking/comments/klhnn2/cleaned_the_aquarium_and_5_minutes_later/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking/comments/l7ze9g/i_caught_a_double_how_rare/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), or [even this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking/comments/e8ap46/the_box_wasnt_empty/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). Rejoice in the knowledge that cats can easily be trapped using this box method!

Now, sometimes, you may trick a cat into being trapped *without* using the tried and true box method. [Like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking/comments/lh1sll/imaginary_cat_trap/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking/comments/g2m18w/a_less_conventional_way_to_catch_felines/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). This should be celebrated, as should all ways of safely capturing felines. Other times, the cat [has clearly had the upper hand for a very long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking/comments/e2r6mt/muahaha_i_outsmarted_her/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) and it’s human has resorted to using [decoy traps](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking/comments/go127u/_/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) in order to work uninterrupted. Thank goodness for the trappable nature of cats! 

Many believe the feline to be the only creature to have domesticated *itself* through sheer intelligence and evolution. I, however, know the truth. Cats are actually the only creature to have domesticated *us*. I had a lot of rules for my cat when he moved in. He wasn’t allowed on the kitchen table. Now, we have compromised and he is allowed on the kitchen table when I am not home, when I am not in the kitchen, and when I am not eating at the kitchen table. He wasn’t allowed in my bed because it exacerbates my allergies, but we compromised and now he sleeps on my pillow all night, right next to my head. I take a lot of Claritin and everyone is happy.

So whether he is settling himself stubbornly into a bin of uncomfortable legos, or taking advantage of the laundry basket full of clean warm towels fresh from the dryer, he is consistently, reliably, and fantastically - trappable.

r/agedlikemilk is a subreddit dedicated to all those things in media and elsewhere that didn’t stand the test of time, at all. What I love about this sub is that it has the perfect balance of nostalgia and cringing about something not going according to plan. Guaranteed to give you a good snicker with some well documented hypocrisy, some good old-fashioned irony, or simply by being tragic and unfortunate. Just scroll through and you are sure to see something that makes you go, “oof!”

Now, for someone like me, who sometimes struggles to understand irony, there is a wonderful feature in which the stickied comment *explains* why the post belongs on the sub. I like this because the last thing my self esteem needs is to end up getting a recommendation to go over to r/whoosh. Redditors can be savage. Which is one of the many reasons I love you but sometimes fear you. Like my grandmother. She was also savage. Fortunately, the women in my family age like wine, not milk, and for that, I am grateful. Thanks Nana!

So, before you go scrolling through with your feed set to “hot,” check out some of my hand-picked, sure to make you go “OH NO!”, choice posts I feature below. These are the posts from r/agedlikemilk that made me groan out loud: 

[The pity prizes were bitcoins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/lhkzmn/a_starcraft_gaming_tournament_took_place_10_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

We are a welcoming community dedicated to 'ricing' our Unix-like operating systems. This refers to the process of visually pimping user interface, and improving functionality, resulting in gorgeous and highly usable systems. The word comes from the older practice of the same name, which involves importing and upgrading cheap cars from rice-exporting countries, and racing them.

I created our subreddit, r/betterunixporn, in response to actions carried out by the mods of r/unixporn, who I, and many other members of our community, feel have been enforcing arbitrary rules and overexerting their authority. In only 27 days, we have gathered over 1100 readers. This has made me very proud, and I would like to attract even more readers.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterunixporn/comments/ls59h0/plasma_gold/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterunixporn/comments/ldgc5d/xmonad_stare_into_death_and_be_still/) are two of my favourite posts so far. Please notice the stunning theming and enticing colour schemes.

  This is a smaller subreddit which is mainly focused on people who act so much on their beliefs that they completely ignore nearly every other counterpart of the religion and they often seem like they are heavily induced on drugs to where it's nearly impossible to tell if they really are.

The subreddit was made because a single comment, and we've been slowly growing over the past few months, but we could really have a bit more potential with more active users. This is legitimately one of my favorite subreddits, and I think that reddit would appreciate it a good amount.

The Subreddit of the Day team wishes to apologize for any lost social credit that occurs as a result of this post. If you find yourself and your family being black-bagged by government agents and [killed in a roaming execution van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_van) like the freedom-loving dissident you are, well, don't blame us. Blame the totalitarian, dystopian regime you're enslaved to.

Ah, /r/Sino. Reddit's no stranger to strangeness, and neither is it free of controversial communities that exist to echo chamber themselves into frenzies and shit up /r/all. You've got all kinds of horrible subreddits on this site, but none are so glorious as /r/Sino. It might be because [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent), a corporate arm of the Chinese Communist Party, gave Reddit [$300,000,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-reddit-funding/reddit-valued-at-3-billion-after-raising-300-million-in-latest-funding-round-idUSKCN1Q020W) recently. It could also be because Reddit's owners are just *really* into authoritarianism. Who knows? We can't see the cause, but we can see the effect. The effect is that /r/Sino is essentially a window into a parallel world where China is perfect, America is Satan's older, more evil brother, and all glory belongs to Emperor Xi Jinping, commonly known as ""Xinnie the Pooh"", ""Chairman Pooh"", ""Big Honey"", and ""Guy who looks like he's allergic to bees but won't stop sticking his face in beehives"". A brief look into /r/Sino will show you all kinds of news stories and articles, usually focusing on ""here's how everyone who isn't us is lying to you"". That's always a good sign. Some fella named Jim told me something similar back in Guyana in the 70s. There's something odd about some of those posts, isn't there? How, despite the low sub population, it's consistently posted from a small source pool by accounts that only exist to hype up the CCP's interests?

Who knows why that could be? Moving on...

You know, I can appreciate the Chinese government in a way. They're at least honest, on some level, about how horrible they are. While officially they'll deny the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989, specifically the massacre of civilians on June 4th, 1989, unofficially they're all for it and probably wish they could just be open about it. ""Yeah, we killed a bunch of students who were protesting for democracy, and we'll kill more, what are you gonna do about it?"" Nothing. You see, because China makes so much money for the West, we'll put up with everything they do, up to and including their recent and ongoing [genocide against the Uyghur people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_genocide). We don't care if they're detaining and killing hundreds of thousands of people, weaponizing rape, and committing countless unspeakable crimes against civilian populations as part of their [long-running Sinicization campaign to control as much as possible at any cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization), as insane authoritarians are known to do. They make us a *lot* of money (us referring to here as governments, corporations, and so on), so any and all offenses are forgiven. We won't stop virtue signalling and proclaiming our love of democracy and freedom around the world, oh no, because that would look bad, and we don't want our politicians and CEOs [losing face over anything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_\(sociological_concept\)#Chinese).

Speaking of Sinicization, let's get back to Reddit. Reddit, as many of you know, was founded in 2005 by a couple of guys, one of whom invisibly edits people's internet comments to insult them and the other of whom is rich as hell and married a star tennis player. The third founder, the late Aaron Swartz, is one that Reddit isn't always keen on acknowledging due to his history of being an activist against all of the things that modern Reddit loves (such as invasions of privacy, user tracking, corporatism, political extremism, fostering hate, etc). I mention all of this because it's not as if Reddit was built to obey Chinese propaganda groups or anything. I'm sure they started out firmly against such things. However, $20 is $20, and $300,000,000 buys a whole lot of not giving a fuck.

Speaking of propaganda, let's get back to the topic of /r/Sino. You're probably already banned from there. If you ever posted anything that didn't end with ""all glory to Jinping"", or you said something horrible and wrong like ""I think people should have rights"", or if you quietly mumbled to yourself in the shower something that resembled the words ""I wish things were better"", then you're almost certainly banned. Serves you right for whispering within forty meters of a party-mandated [telescreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescreen). To learn more about /r/Sino, and why it's *not* as bad as I and every post-Cretaceous organism should think it is, I called my old pal Lednem Reivax to clear things up in this brief Q&A.

###1. Welcome back, Lednem. It's been a while. So, you're one of the new mods over on /r/Sino, huh? How'd that happen?

> **LednemReivax:** Oh, what a story. See, I was visiting China, because I heard that the pollution is so bad in Beijing that you can't see in front of your own face, so I figured nobody could see mine, and being ugly as sin, that sounded good. Unfortunately, I got shanghaied out of Shanghai onto what I first thought was some dilapidated fishing ship covered in cocaine and shrimp grease, but was really just some guy's apartment. Well, he handcuffed me to a radiator, fed me cocaine and shrimp grease, and made me write articles talking about how great China is. I just made up half of it, and the rest I got from the guy next to me. His name was Zhu, and he eventually got shot for misspelling ""phosphorescence"" as ""help I'm being held against my will"". Poor Zhu. Anyway, my ability to bullshit and my knack for always carrying Sriracha sauce on me lead me to being given an audience with some high-ranking people who invited me to work for the most luxurious and well-paid arm of the Chinese Communist Party. That's how I ended up handcuffed to a deluxe radiator and fed cocaine and shrimp. Not just the grease, and it even had a cup holder! Anyway, most of what I do now is run the bot accounts and post about how China is great and everyone else sucks. It's easy work, and good money, too. I'm being paid ¥5 an hour, which they say is equal to $50 USD, so that's awesome.

###2. ... Kay. Well, could you tell me a bit about /r/Sino? Is it really as bad as people say?

> **LednemReivax:** Depends what people say, I guess. We're the definition of ""out of touch"" since, despite our work spreading propaganda, misinformation, and so on, we don't actually read much of the news or keep informed on what real people are talking about. Plus, a lot of things are censored here. The most factual, unbiased news source we have is a show called ""Glory Glory Xi Jinping"", developed by Tencent, the comrades behind games like ""Clap for Xi Jinping"", software in the Great Firewall, and of course, Reddit.com. I keep hearing stuff about this American Capitalist Pig Virus that Warlord Trump has attempted to weaponize and use against the People's Republic of China, and has spread as far as Chinese Playing-Hard-To-Get State of Germany, but I'm not clear on the details. Still, it's enough for an article, at least. I'm writing one right now about how America is slaughtering millions and dumping their corpses on Chinese soul to frame China and plans on annexing Mars. That's most of what we do here. That and ban anyone who says anything bad in accordance with our Censorship Charter.

###3. I imagine the Hong Kong protests must've been a tough time for you, activity-wise. How was that?

> **LednemReivax:** Hong Kong what? Hong Kong is a part of China that was absorbed back into it following British Colonialist Imperialist Badstuff back in the day. Now it's a pleasure island where everyone lives happy lives. They're completely loyal to the CCP. They even showed video of it on Glory Glory Xi Jinping this morning, with tons of Hong Kong people happily visiting their great cultural landmarks, like the Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower, which, translated from their Mandarin names, mean ""Glorious People's Big House"" and ""Glorious People's Big Tower"". I even saved one, since I really love how clear and blue Hong Kong looks. [You can see it here at the People's Glorious Big Lady Statue!](https://i.imgur.com/baQ3fFI.jpg)

###4. That's not... Yeah, looks good, Lednem. So, I think I've got a good picture of what it's all about. Anything else we ought to know about /r/Sino?

> **LednemReivax:** If you're one of the chosen few who aren't banned yet, you really ought to come by this weekend. We're hosting the Glorious People's Chinese Poetry Contest, where all six of us will be competing with some party-approved poetry and putting it up to a vote. Of course, the vote's already been decided. Unfortunately, I didn't win, which is fine, since I don't know what they've given me to have written yet either, so it must've been bad. Anyway, the winner receives an all-expense paid luxury fifteen minute break. Maybe next year I'll earn one, too. Besides that, we've also got our new board game we're unveiling soon, ""Glorious People's Game of Life"". It's a bit like Life, only there's a good chance of being aborted before the game starts if you start as a girl, and your odds of getting to adulthood are slim since there are quite a lot of opportunities to die. It's kind of like the Dark Souls of propaganda board games. We're proud of it.

###5. Thanks for everything, Lednem. Hope you get out of captivity soon. Anything else you'd like to say?

> **LednemReivax:** Be sure to check out the new DLC for Clap for Xi Jinping, ""Cheer for Xi Jinping Or Else"", available now on iOS and the Epic Games Store! Remember: So long as you do what your told and don't think wrong or seem to notice when the guy next to you gets his organs harvested mid-shift and docked pay for the hour away from his desk, you'll do fine. Good soldiers follow orders.

Thanks again to Lednem for his, uh, insightful words. I'm not sure whether to be disgusted, horrified, or something else entirely.

I think I'm going to go have a quick lie down on the bed and contemplate free will, tyranny, and so on. Be sure to check out /r/Sino for, uh... Some reason.

Once again, Subreddit of the Day is not liable for any lost social credit, heads, or lives of loved ones resulting from reading this article. Stay strong, stand with Hong Kong, free Tibet.

This is not a light-hearted feature.

**This is a public service announcement.**

Today, we here at SRotD hope to educate you all on perhaps the most vile, heartless [parasite](https://redd.it/bq40si) in existence. We are, of course, talking about Grandpa Joe.

For the blissfully unaware, Grandpa Joe is a character from the Roald Dahl book *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, which was later made into a movie ~~of the same name~~ called *Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory* (the name change presumably to shift focus away from the Bucket family, à la the Hitler family changing their name and vowing to never have children after WW2). It's a whimsical tale about a young boy from an impoverished family having a jamboree in a fantasy land that also doubles as the greatest chocolate factory in the world. A heartwarming tale, if you ignore the child murder and slave labour. There is but one blemish on the horizon (again, ignoring the child murder and slave labour, check into SrotD tomorrow if you want to hear more about those), and that blemish has a name. [Grandpa Joe.](https://i.redd.it/h01yhcbmrdp31.jpg) Look at that shit-eating grin. He knows what he's doing.

*****

A quick summary for those unfamiliar with the story; Charlie Bucket and his family are super duper poor. Their only source of income is from their father, working in a toothpaste factory. On top of little Charlie Bucket and his parents, they must support their 4 grandparents, Joe, Josephine, George, and Georgina, each of which is completely bedridden (or so we're told). Mr and Mrs Bucket have to break their backs working to support this large family, and still manage to give little Charlie a normal childhood, at the expense of their own well-being. It's a tragic life, but they get by, if barely.

Then one day, their luck turns around, as Charlie finds a Golden Ticket. The world-renowned chocolate factory owner and vintage Elon Musk-style capitalist, Mr Willy Wonka, has shut away his factory for years and years, nobody entered, nobody left. Until one day, he announces that he's placed 5 Golden Tickets into 5 of his company's chocolate bars, and whoever found them would gain a lifetime supply of Wonka Bars, along with a tour of the factory! A good deal, and wouldn't you know it, Charlie just so happens to find one!

Now, little Charlie is allowed to take one person along. And as he excitedly tells his family about his find, one person stands up. Literally. Grandpa Joe, who has been bedridden for *decades*, seemingly nothing but a husk of a man, [*jumps out of bed*](https://gfycat.com/gaseousresponsiblealligator). This motherfucker just straight up yeets himself out of bed. He's doing  gymnastics and shit. He's dancing. And he convinces, nay, *manipulates* Charlie into letting him go to the factory with him.

In other words, this asshole, perhaps intentionally, perhaps not, reveals to the world that not only has he been able-bodied this whole time, but that he was perfectly content chilling in bed, getting his meals fed to him, having  his poor daughter do all the hard work for him.

And once you realise this and begin to look closer, you start to notice [all the things about this man that don't add up.](https://i.redd.it/fmyj2jxxs6831.gif) And there are a *lot* of them. **[Here is the comprehensive list of all the ways that this man is a human turd.](http://saynotograndpajoe.com/index.php)**

*****

You'd be forgiven for not copping on to all of this on your first watch. That's why /r/GrandpaJoeHate exists. It is a sub on a mission to spread the world about this lying, misogynistic, evil man, through the tried-and-true method of [shitposting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/bpd6hd/grandpa_joe_is_a_piece_of_shit/) The posts in this sub range from [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/fm55um/joevid_19/) to [exposés](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/bdi2rx/here_is_the_link_to_my_7_page_essay_on_why/) to[fucking tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/af95cd/heres_the_tattoo_everyone_may_our_hatred_of_joe/), but they all revolve around the same central point: hating this man.

Check the sub out! Fuck Grandpa Joe.

You've just caught somebody being a special asshole. Maybe they stole from charity, or tried to commit a hate crime, or kicked your dog, or put mayonnaise on spaghetti in full view of a room full of innocent eyeballs, or something else horrible. You call them out for it, and the internet, enraged by all of these very enraging things, demands an apology. They put one out, but their ""apology"" doesn't say ""sorry"" anywhere. What it does say is always a variation of that magic phrase: ""This isn't who I am.""

/r/ThisIsntWhoWeAre is a subreddit dedicated to those non-apologies. People who get caught being who they are trying to pretend that isn't who they are. Not only does it enrage you to see someone doing the kind of terrible things that get posted there, but, at least for me, the hypocrisy and lack of any morals just builds it further. Being one of those people that thinks that it's more respectable to be honest about being a prick than to hide it and just be a prick in the shadows, this kind of hedging and pretending is enough to bother my booty to great degrees.

Mostly, the subreddit focuses on right-wing people that pretend to be normal and healthy while supporting things like Qanon, the KKK, and, of course, the GOP, three groups that are far from normal and healthy. It's often made of news stories containing the statement itself, though the magic words need not be used. Similar excuses fit, of course. Personally, one of my favorites is [this post from after the failed Capitol coup](https://www.reddit.com/r/thisisntwhoweare/comments/l1q2s7/every_post_i_have_ever_made_on_this_website_is/), and similar, with crazies on Parler desperately trying to get themselves away from the oncoming train of consequences. We ought to talk more about that soon...

Anyway, come check it out and laugh in equal parts humor and sadness at the state of whatever you'd call this segment of society. It's one source of laughs that'll, sadly, probably never go away.

When we think of the past, generally we focus on the big historical events of those times. What's often less remembered are the small, everyday things. Stuff like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYbe-35_BaA), of just people going about their day, tend to be more fascinating than any televised or published media of the time. And if you go back to ancient history, it's even stuff like [graffiti in Pompeii](https://old.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5iy6i4/ancient_graffiti_in_pompeii_is_hilarious_and/) that people enjoy, because it makes those people of the past seem human. In the same way, when we find random unimportant things that people forgot about, it's like uncovering a bit of history. Not a particularly important bit of history, but it's something. /r/ForgottenBookmarks exists to highlight a very niche section of this mundane archaeology, that being, old and forgotten things people have found inside used books! These range from [100 year old notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForgottenBookmarks/comments/hy8616/found_someones_116_year_old_travel_itinerary/) to [ancient relics from dinosaur times](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForgottenBookmarks/comments/f4gc07/cool_vintage_bookmark_i_found/), [literally $1,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForgottenBookmarks/comments/lwoi78/1000000/), and more! 


Of course, not everything on this sub is 40 year old borderline antiques *(reminder to our older readers that 1980 was 41 years ago)*, sometimes it's just [dumb shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForgottenBookmarks/comments/kdzlbg/leg/) that people have found in between pages. but even then, it's like a glimpse into the previous reader's soul... Or something poetic like that, I don't know, I should spend more time reading the books and not just flicking through to find cool things. My shoddy prose aside, if you're looking to a cool sub to browse, this one is definitely one to check out!

It's a romance-comedy centering around main characters Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, two geniuses at the top of their class at a prestigious high school in Japan who have fallen in love with each other and play various mind games to try and make the other confess first. ""Genius"" here refers to the fact that they're intelligent, not that they have a lick of common sense, because they certainly do not. There's a [host of other characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaguya_sama/comments/llj5wu/take_me_out_inspired_by_ed1by_%E5%9D%9B%E5%AD%90%E9%B8%A6/) with their own stories set at the Shuchiin Academy, with the story shifting around in time and space to focus on the many tales of its great cast.

The series, which currently has two anime seasons and will be releasing a third this year, has spawned a large fanbase in the West among people of culture. If you ask a fan, they'll tell you it's because we like the mind games, strategies, and psych- no we won't. We're all lonely and wish we had someone who loved us as much as Shinomiya and the President love each other. We all wish we had someone who looked at us when they laughed, to think we're the coolest person in the room even when we're being lame, and want to be with us even when we're not doing so well. Humans are empty, and we all desire someone to fill us- actually, let's find another analogy...

It's a romantic comedy that does things I've personally never seen a romcom do, which is both a testament to it being good and me not having read enough romcoms. It's the kind of series that makes you feel warm and fuzzy one second and cold and alone the next, mostly by making you realize that nobody will ever care about you as much as practically anyone in the series cares about anyone else. That's fine, though. There are a few seasons and a couple of hundred chapters, so you can stave off the loneliness for quite a while with this one. If you're a horny weeb, there's also an official doujin to stave that off, too. Personally, I recommend keeping your hands tied and your bed covered in corn flakes to prevent such dishonorable activity, but it's a free country, and also, that's probably someone's thing.

Well, when you're done letting the abyss look long back into you, head over to /r/Kaguya_sama to check out something a bit less existential. There's fan art, there's discussion, there's a debate over whether Fujiwara is an agent of Tzeentch, all the usual stuff of a fan community. You'll likely want to catch up on the manga if you plan on diving head first and really taking part, though there's no need to get caught up on everything. There's also a light novel and a side series manga (and the aforementioned doujin), but you don't really need to read any of those to take part. Supposedly, they're all good, and I don't have a joke about the doujin, so pretend I made one and laugh. Wait, no, it'd still be my joke... Pretend I made one and then feel our relationship meter drop as you begin to dislike me by a death by a thousand cuts.

Alright, get out of here and go check it out. Go feel warm and possess the fuzziness that I cannot.

Internet arguments are a big deal. Like, if you don't win every internet argument you're involved in, then you're basically just a trash person. But sometimes, it can be difficult to argue a point, because the other asshole keeps bringing out """"""facts"""""" and """"""scientific data"""""" like what a fucking nerd amirite? So you need to get your hands a bit dirty sometimes. I mean, your honour is at stake here. Unfortunately, everyone else on the internet is stupid and disagrees with you for some reason, so you're on your own. But have no fear, because you don't need friends to back you up, you can make your own!!!

A burner account, also known as an alt, throwaway, etc, is simply an account made to post something that you can't/don't want to post with your main. Sometimes that's an embarrassing story, a post that you think could be used to identify you when combined with the rest of your account history, or porn. They're mostly used for porn. But they can also be used more tactically. Sock puppet accounts are what they're called when they're used in this manner. You see it all the time in sketchy AMAs (check out /r/AMADisasters for examples!), suspiciously new accounts with next to no posts or comments, coming into the thread and asking a bunch of softball questions. It's incredibly obvious most of the time, and is often rather humorous. 

What's even more funny, however, is when the person in control of these burner accounts fucks up, and posts on their main account by mistake. [**This one**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftTheBurnerOn/comments/jrtc9u/pretty_sure_he_is_neither_of_those_things/) is the all time classic, and there are many more examples to be found. Fortunately, /r/LeftTheBurnerOn exists to showcase these!

As I'm sure our intelligent, perfect readers have gathered, /r/LeftTheBurnerOn (should I capitalize ""the""? I think it's grammatically incorrect but it looks weird if I don't) is a place to highlight, and make fun of, people accidentally exposing themselves as using burner accounts. It showcases examples ranging from the above post by a politician, to [redditors pretending to be different races](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftTheBurnerOn/comments/jpl93d/from_ukontrolling/), to [the ***former president of the United States of America*** complimenting themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftTheBurnerOn/comments/ca3nbs/sigh/), and then the mundane. like [sending hate mail to yourself on Tumblr](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftTheBurnerOn/comments/kozopx/sure_bud/). Hmm... I can nearly see a pattern in the people doing this. Odd. Also, everyone's favourite type of internet dumbfuckery, [edgy kids being super edgy](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftTheBurnerOn/comments/cy7zv3/damn_savage/), and... [whatever this is](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftTheBurnerOn/comments/dauper/danny/). With that plethora of examples (I did sorta get sucked into the sub for a while there), I'm sure you get the picture! It's a sub filled with hilarious content to binge, and one that I recommend you all check out!

First of all, I'd just like to remind our readers at SrotD that the term ""dude"" is, in fact, gender neutral. Guys can be dudes. Women can be dudes as well. We're all dudes, unless you're an asshole. Then nobody likes you.

But all that aside, it is a well known fact that when you get a bunch of guys and leave them in a room together, dumb shit will ensue. Nobody ever really stops being a weird ass child, you just learn to hide it as an adult. But When there's nobody around to give a shit, us humans are quite happy to engage in stupidity with the lads. /r/JustGuysBeingDudes aims to highlight some of this dumbfuckery that ensues.

Simply put, /r/JustGuysBeingDudes is a sub for videos guys goofing around, having fun, being weird, and doing all the dumb shit you'd expect of this demographic. It's one of those subs you can just binge for hours on end, and being a fairly new sub, the posts are all recent as well! I think that's all there is to it really, so I'll leave you with some of my favourite posts from the sub:

* [**""I don’t understand, but I love it.""**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustGuysBeingDudes/comments/jvephw/i_dont_understand_but_i_love_it/)

* [**""Just guys being dudes""**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustGuysBeingDudes/comments/jrgrxk/just_guys_being_dudes/) (very descriptive title)

* [**""Setting off red light cameras... with a shopping cart?""**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustGuysBeingDudes/comments/k8yppf/setting_off_red_light_cameras_with_a_shopping_cart/) (actually a descriptive title)

Birds. A group of warm-blooded vertebrates , often characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs.

Or are they?

More and more people have been waking up to the unfortunate truth: birds as you know them do not exist. It is unknown if they ever existed in the first place, while others like [this gentleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uaCG2lvE9w) assert that the government wiped them out. Either way, the conclusion is the same - birds today are nothing more than government drones. 

I know how it sounds. I thought it was ludicrous at first, too. But the more I thought about it, the more it makes sense. 

Sure, the government may try and surveil you through your phones or computers, but what about when you go outside? Go off the grid? Well then they'd have to use drones, but disguised ones to avoid arousing suspicion. But still, there are signs...

I mean think about it, have you ever actually seen a baby pigeon? And can you even picture it living naturally? Like, outside of a city? Of course not, it's preposterous. There's no way pigeons can be real animals, so they must be government drones.

Now I am awake to the truth. And hopefully you are too.

I recently talked with /u/Plain_Pasta_, one of the moderators of /r/BirdsArentReal, to ask a few questions about their movement.

^(Answers edited for formatting purposes)

>#1. Why did you start/join the subreddit?  

>> I’ve been a supporter of this movement for a few years now, and when I got the option to spread the word on reddit, I knew that it was something that I could use to build a unique community.

>#2. What's moderating the sub like?  

>> Day to day it’s mostly just reposts and spam but with a community like this one you’re bound to find some fun characters.

>#3. What are some of your favourite posts?  

>> I always love to see people spreading the word out in public. Pictures of some of the amazing street art and activism that people are doing in the real world are definitely my favorite.

>#4. What are your plans for the sub in the future?  

>> We’ve had a fairly large growth over a relatively short period of time, so for now I just want to do what I can to keep that growth going.

>#5. Anything else you want to add?  

>> If you want to get more involved in the movement be sure to check out @birdsarentreal on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/birdsarentreal/?hl=en), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/birdsarentreal), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@birdsarentreal?lang=en)!

I fucking love /r/copypasta. There is nothing bad, nor could there ever be anything bad about /r/copypasta. For those who don't know, ""copypasta"" is defined as ""a block of text which is repeatedly copied and pasted by individuals over various online forums and social media sites"", such as [Reddit.](https://i.redd.it/18qmo596hl841.jpg)  
  
The ability to copy and paste has given power to users for decades. Writing an assignment the night before it's due, on a subject you have no knowledge about? Easy - copy and paste from Wikipedia! Losing an argument with someone online? Then just copy and paste a long elaborate insult from /r/copypasta. Copypasta comes in all shapes and sizes. There's the [short pasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/jyrnig/if_you_watch_spiderman_2002_in_reverse_its_about/), the [long pasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/k1dukh/a_giant_list_of_puns/), even the [medium pasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/k20dgu/i_need_a_femboy/). All pasta is welcome. I personally love taking the funny medium-sized ones, such as [""The ending of the WWII is AWFUL""](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/k03b3i/the_ending_of_the_wwii_is_awful/), and copy and pasting them into group chats, where they assume I've written it out and leave me on seen in pure awe of my autism. Of course, they don't know that I'm actually not that funny.  
  
The classic pasta, the creme de la creme, the tour de force, the magnum opus, is of course the Navy Seal copypasta. If you are unfortunate enough to not be aware of this classic pasta, it goes as follows:  
  
\*ahem\*
  
>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.   
  
  
  

Yeah. Amazing, right? That about wraps up today's feature, please share your favourite copypastas in the comments and remember to like and subscribe (and hit that bell icon)!

People on the internet like to lie. It's an unfortunate fact that when given anonymity, some people will just make shit up that's so obviously untrue that you just have to wonder if they have any hint of self-awareness in them at all. Combine this with Reddit's general skepticism towards, like, everything, and it naturally results in much of this stuff being called out as bullshit, and gets laughed at. As is the way of the world. 

This is how /r/ThatHappened came to be, a subreddit that to highlight these obviously fake, attention-seeking posts about [destroying doctors with antivax logic](https://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/comments/ay4e22/medical_expert_here/) and [discovering the secret globist conspiracies that they don't want you to know about](https://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/comments/b5rpnm/imagine_thinking_anyone_would_believe_you/)!

But, as is the caveat with all things involving people, you're gonna get some stupid ones. Alright, perhaps that's a bit too harsh. You're going to get some people who are overly cynical and far too skeptical of things. We live in a huge world, and with so many people around doing things, weird and rare situations will arise naturally. It is a difficult task discerning the real from the fake, especially in a time when most don't particularly care for sources and/or logic. The denizens of /r/ThatHappened fight the good fight, but unfortunately can go too far on occasion. So /r/NothingEverHappens exists as a yin to their yang

/r/NothingEverHappens is the counter sub to /r/ThatHappened, [which we just featured yesterday!](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/lppsza/february_22nd_2021_rthathappened_and_the_whole/) /r/ThatHappened calls out people for posting fake stories. /r/NothingEverHappens calls out /r/ThatHappened for calling out fake stories that probably aren't actually fake. Simple! Sometimes those stories are [extraordinary at first glance but are backed up by facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nothingeverhappens/comments/g7brvx/fun_fact_chris_evanss_dad_is_a_dentist_he_even/), sometimes they're just plain old [stories that are believable](https://www.reddit.com/r/nothingeverhappens/comments/cm9uol/as_a_waitress_i_can_confirm_i_still_have_a_sense/). Of course, with the opposing sub ethos comes a bit of rivalry between the 2 subs, but it's all internet, so it's in fun *(translation: Don't be cunts to people in /r/ThatHappened, and vice versa)* The point to take away from these subs is this: Don't believe everything you read on the internet ^(~~insert unfunny overused meme quote here~~) , but remember that the world is an interesting place, and interesting things can happen. Also no seriously I met jeff bezos in walmart the other day and he gave he a million dollars why wont you believe me im super seriou-

Everyone knows the internet is a reliable source of information. Everything's true here. After all, when there's anonymity, why bother lying? This has been known since the days of Lincoln himself, who famously remarked on the internet being more honest than him and Washington combined. Abraham Lincoln later grew up and became Elon Musk, and gave the entire union $2,000 shillings, and gave them each a free Falcon 9.




It feels almost wrong to have to say that this is false, because if how painfully untrue it is. You just understand it's fake, I don't have to spell it out for you, I hope. And that's also the case with the stuff over on /r/ThatHappened. It's where you can find all of the bullshit, stupid, and intelligence insulting lies that some idiots spew out online, in a quest to validate their insecurities with feeble praise from random people they don't even know. Because internet. Sometimes it's as simple as [guys I had so much sex look at all the sex I have](https://redd.it/bv7q5k), or perhaps it's [our valiant hero defending the females from the chads](https://redd.it/k0ufwg), and sometimes it's users in the sub messing up and [accidentally posting true stories](https://redd.it/i2unow) (I mean, it ***says*** true story right there). And that's not even touching on the wealth of cringy ass teenage quirkiness posts like [this one](https://redd.it/ampjad), [this one](https://redd.it/90vt47), [this one](https://redd.it/85om85), [this one](https://redd.it/6mwlr4), [this one](https://redd.it/dtev2u), [this one](https://redd.it/ct8pho), [this one](https://redd.it/6eh8et), [this one](https://redd.it/bfj002), [this one](https://redd.it/b9chc8), [this one](https://redd.it/jogcb3), [this one](https://redd.it/asqw8l) ok you probably get the picture now. While the internet will never be rid of people posting dumb shit and pretending it's true, I mean, /r/sino exists ^(~~</sick social commentary>~~) , at least we can laugh at the 100% completely confirmed factual stories found on /r/ThatHappened, the sub for the stories that happened the most out of all!

Lightsabers are cool. This does not need to be oversold or explained. They're plasma swords that can cut through almost anything like warm butter and make fwoom-fwoosh noises when you swing them. When they touch they crackle and make cool lights. Lightsabers are cool, and you want one, and I want one, and some people aren't keen on waiting for them to hit the shelves, so they're making their own.

The people on /r/lightsabers discuss the building of custom lightsabers. Much like younglings on a quest to obtain their first kyber crystal, this arduous process is so mighty a task that the aid of others is often necessary, such as in diagnosing why your lightsaber won't ignite with plasma, but instead just seems to fill a plastic tube with light. You won't be able to defeat a sith lord with that, so be sure to get it working right!

Due to the recent trend of people playing D&D on virtual tabletops (which is responsible in 2021), I don't have to explain exactly what a battlemap is in detail. Put simply, it's a map, typically overhead in perspective, that GMs/DMs put player tokens/minis on to represent the in-game surroundings. They range from the old school way of black lines on a white background, like we used to do with markers way back in the Mesozoic, and complicated 3D environments and video loops with dynamic entities. All methods are fine, really, since the goal is to represent an area, which can be done at any skill level, but you'll see a wide variety of styles.

/r/battlemaps is a community to share those kinds of maps for use in your campaigns. The majority of the content is made up of posts from people sharing maps they've created, though the subreddit also allows discussion of map creation, reviews of maps you've used in your campaign, and some other related topics. Recently, the subreddit's moderators reformatted their rules and included a rule that maps must be usable, so the amount of advertising has gone down, too, which is fantastic. They've also been improving the subreddit in other ways, such as the introduction of weekly request/help posts, a host of post flairs to sort through submissions, and [a great resource post for mapmaking software](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlemaps/comments/lgeloa/best_free_and_paid_mapmaking_software_rbattlemaps/). I'm a big fan of all of these things.

As for the mod team itself, I reached out to them with a few questions. Here's what they had to say...

---

###1. First, could you tell us a bit about yourselves?

> **TheOvershear:** After I recently started making battlemaps myself, I got really invested into this subreddit. It was extremely active, but unfortunately, had only one active mod. So, since I've had plenty of experience moderating on DND related discords, I wanted to offer my help to r/battlemaps to help shape it up a little. The sub is honestly amazing and it's really cool to see a gathering of some big faces in Map design all get together to share and critique each other's work. 

> **Darklyte:** I've been playing RPGs for over 20 years and I love everything about GMing. I got into the habit of making extremely complicated hand-drawn battlemaps for my players, and love exploring the web for new resources. They were pretty hard to find at the time and I realized there was no battlemap community, so when someone suggested we make one, we did! I has been a lot of work, especially since the other moderators are no longer active, but I'm really happy with the work the two new mods are putting in.

> **MakeltStop:** I'm in my third decade of playing tabletop RPGs, and while I love being both a player and GM, I have just as much interest in the worldbuilding and game design side of things. Outside of my role here in /r/battlemaps, I also run a weekly discussion in /r/Pathfinder_RPG that focuses on rewriting rules and content to improve on some of the more flawed material out there.

###2. What has been your favorite map that's been posted on /r/battlemaps so far? What makes it your favorite?

> **TheOvershear:** [This map by Czepeku has been used in every single campaign of mine so far.](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlemaps/comments/e602lo/rooftop_chase_16x50/) It's so unique but perfect for it's situation, when you need a chase scene through packed city streets.

> **Darklyte:** My favorite map is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlemaps/comments/hinbbo/ocanimatedbattlemap_suspended_sarsen_40x22/). It is extremely cinematic, offers challenges that aren't directly related, gives places for enemies to enter/exit the fight, and has multiple levels of terrain. 

> **MakeltStop:** If I have to pick a favorite, I'd probably go with [Neuschwanstein](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlemaps/comments/bbml6o/i_made_a_map_of_neuschwanstein_in_bavaria_the/). First, I appreciate anything big enough to fill an entire session, especially if it has multiple levels. It's not the biggest or most beautiful, but it is very effective at what it does. It's very clear and easy to read, the minimalist design leaves a lot of room for the GM to add things and run it in their own way, and it manages to be both gigantic and claustrophobic at the same time. Plus being both a real place and a friendship ending wonder in Civilization just adds to the charm.

###3. What tips would you give someone just starting out in using and making battlemaps?

> **TheOvershear:** I could make a huge list, but to keep it compact... First, in subreddit polls, nearly 80% of people prefer gridless maps. This is because most digital VTT programs use their own grid, and it's a PAIN to align them. Just make it gridless, and let users figure it out. Second, don't be afraid to shop around for good software. We feature a list of decent Mapmaking programs in our sidebar, that's a good place to start. Some are simply better than others. Finally, consider the level of detail. If you're making a huge map, with the expectation of downscaling, remember that most maps expect a minimum of 100 pixels per grid square. That's not a ton of detail possible, so don't over-detail tiny spaces or you end up with an unrecognizable blob when zoomed in (this is a big problem with new artists, myself included). Roll20 has, I believe, a 5MB cap on uploads for free users, so consider how it'll look when downscaled. 

> **Darklyte:**     When I draw my own maps, I try to keep a few things in mind:

> - Make sure the environment actually affects the encounter in some way
- Elevation makes combat more interesting
- There should be entrances/exits and places for creatures to hide
- Figure out where you think players/monsters will be. Combatants don't move too much once engaged, and you don't want them stuck on the edge of the map.

> **MakeltStop:** There's a delicate balance between art, tactics, story and flexibility. I can't really tell you how to make it pretty, that's not my strong suit, but the rest I can touch on.

> - Tactics: While a map can be stunningly beautiful, it's important consider what it adds to the encounter. Does it have enough space for movement and ranged combat? Are there obstacles, cover, dangers and difficult terrain? Are there three or more dimensions in play? Are there shortcuts or hidden options which can benefit the party in addition to those hindering them? Personally, I try to start with a tactical design before addressing other considerations
- Story: The design of a map can be immersive and give new information to the party. Or it can be nonsensical from an in-universe perspective. While Raiders of the Lost Ark style traps are a fun trope, consider making them hazards instead. Try to sprinkle elements in that imply a past event or hidden truth, such as a vampire's lair having multiple broken mirrors and a single torn curtain.
- Flexibility: No plan survives contact with the party. Try to leave room for new additions or to move elements around. Putting in too much detail or static images in place of tokens can not only clutter a map, but can confuse players or give them false impressions of what is going on. The less you lock in details the more you can add or takeaway in the future.


###4. Is there anything else you'd like to say?

> **TheOvershear:** r/battlemaps isn't just for the professional map makers, it's also for those who are learning! If you make a neat map, please post it! If you want critiques, please come by. The sub is as much a place for feedback as it is a resource dump for DMs.

> Also check out r/battletokens!

> **Darklyte:** I'm really happy the community is thriving so well and that it is considered a ""big"" subreddit among the RPG communities. I hope it can continue to grow and everyone continues to enjoy it.

> **MakeltStop:** /r/battlemaps has really been a great resource for me as a GM in the past, not just to find a map for whatever I need, but to inspire me with adventure ideas that can incorporate some of the more exotic and original maps out there. Sometimes you don't realize that you need something until it's right there in front of you. Also if anyone is interested in improving their map making skills, don't be shy, we'd love to see what you've got.

The premise is simple: Pick two characters/groups. They fight, debate, or otherwise engage in a conflict with one another. Who wins? Explain what answer you arrive at and defend it. The OP sets conditions for the battles, such as ""Thanos doesn't have the Infinity Stones"" or ""Jimmy Neutron is under surveillance for suspected domestic terrorism"", which limits the scope of the battle to agreed-upon conditions and prevents many weird outlier events, such as bringing up the episode of Ed Edd n Eddy where Eddy eats the sun to fuel his divine strength.

You can also put two factions, groups, series, or worlds against each other. For instance, the Baudelaire orphans vs the Soprano family. You can make it a non-standard fight, such as a formal debate between Malcolm from Malcolm in the Middle and Jed Bartlet from The West Wing. It's a good excuse to practice internet debating without it being high stakes, since the subreddit requires you to be able to back up your arguments and provide evidence for claims when pressed. That way you can keep your debate skills sharp without being hunted down and murdered for debating someone in a political subreddit over whether we should prohibit the hunting for sport of poor people or not.

Some matchups could be the plot to a movie the world never knew it needed, such as [Mystique vs Black Widow](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/lkxf2t/mystique_vs_black_widow/), which would make a *killer* spy vs spy movie, or [Gundams vs Godzilla](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/lk9hdj/which_gundam_if_any_can_kill_shin_godzilla/), which just sounds so fucking cool because I'm a smooth-brain and go nuts for big robots fighting monsters.

You'll also get the occasional people who don't quite understand what they're putting forward. For instance, anyone that brings up Saitama from One Punch Man has missed the point. Beyond a certain level of power, and especially when it comes to gag characters, the debates get tricky. Your mileage may vary. Stay away from unbeatable matchups like Mob, Saiki, Azathoth, and Samwise Gamgee.

Come debate your favorite matchups and explain to us in detail why you believe the T-1000 would beat Avatar Korra (he'd get smoked, don't kid yourself), or how you think the Planet Express employees would fare against the Odd Jobs crew of Gintama (it all depends on the wild card, Professor Farnsworth). I'm eager to read what matchups you all can come up with.

Inmate CV-11 of the Department of Special Corrections, commonly known as Civvie 11, is a prisoner kept a hundred-odd stories below the ground where he's forced to produce youtube videos about boomer shooters. His many plights, such as how his bathroom is a bucket and his mouse is irradiated, have earned him a soft spot among fans who are seeking to free him from his unjust captivity. Hence the hashtag, [#freecivvie](https://twitter.com/Civvie11).

Civvie mostly [makes videos about so-called boomer shooters](https://www.youtube.com/c/Civvie11/videos), which are FPS games that use old school designs for the general gameplay. Think Doom, Strife, Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, those sorts of games. Being a veteran of these games, Civvie has a long-running Pro series, like Pro Blood, which shows the game from the perspective of a player who's only a little garbage instead of a lot of garbage. I started watching him because of his Pro Postal videos, but they're all great. I watched an hour-long video about Daikatana because he made it. You think anyone else could get me to spend another minute on that crap? I bought that shit retail. I don't need those memories resurfacing.

Honestly, I could just fill this with more references, but I shouldn't. I don't need to ask, ""Pro Halo when Civvie?"" I shouldn't bring up the sore spot of Civvie being a side character in his own show, which is being renamed to ""Cancer Mouse's House of Cancerous Mouse"". More than anything, I really shouldn't bring up the fact that the Department of Special Corrections is using us for this feature to lay the promotional groundwork for their next initiative, ""Work+"", which is the rebranding of their failed initiative, ""Using our Prisoners as Slave Labor"".

Anyway, give him a watch, then check in with /r/Civvie11 where you can ask him to do a Pro Katamari Damacy video or whatever and vote on whether he gets fed today or not. Normal fan subreddit stuff.

##**You want to hear about the cool event? Read the bottom of this post!**

Look, I'll be honest here... I'm not that great of a writer. I mean, I can write these things, but y'know, ***anyone*** can (that's foreshadowing btw). Perhaps this is just the vice of comparison though, for there are some truly stellar writers on this site, from your famous accounts like poem_for_your_sprog and shittymorph, to maybe ***even you***, dear reader (also foreshadowing, if I were a better writer I wouldn't need to point it out).


If you're been on Reddit, then you've seen /r/WritingPrompts. If you've not been on Reddit before, then hi! I'm /u/conalfisher, and this has probably been a very confusing read for you thus far. If you've not heard of /r/WritingPrompts, or perhaps just need a reminder: /r/WritingPrompts is a place where users post prompts for a story, and other users answer them. Prompt writing is good fun, it's a way of expressing your authorial creativity without having to go through the sometimes excruciating process of finding ""that good idea"", because somebody else has already done the first step for you! This is really *the* subreddit where people go to hone their writing skills; you have beginner writers in there, mixed along with people who have published novels. Hell, sometimes people even end up [making novels based on writing prompts they responded to!](https://redd.it/ioanmu)

While researching this feature, I found the last time we featured this subreddit, [here](https://redd.it/1f6s3b), in 2013. Back when /r/WritingPrompts had just [over 9000](https://gfycat.com/ajareagerannashummingbird) subscribers (and back when that meme was still relevant), and this sub had 60,000. Oh how times have changed, WP is currently sitting on 15 million subscribers, which is a whole 15 times larger than us! ^(no im not jealous shut up shut up SHUT UP)



&nbsp;

#The event!

Do you like writing? Do you like subreddits? Would you like to see those subreddits get the love they deserve? If so, then it's a good thing you're here, because /r/SubredditoftheDay is collaborating with /r/WritingPrompts to bring to you, a small contest!

If you have a keen eye, you may have noticed my *extremely subtle* hints of what this entails. We're asking *you*, dear readers, to **write a paragraph or two about YOUR favourite subreddit!** They don't have to be anything spectacular, this is a creative exercise, but...

We will be taking the best few user submissions and **featuring them here on SrotD** (fully credited, of course)!

In addition, those people who get their posts featured will:

* Be given **Reddit Gold**, with the *very best* being given **platinum**;


* Along with this, those talented individuals will be given the opportunity to **become a moderator of /r/SubredditoftheDay!**

This contest will end on the **17th February**, in 4 day's time.

##This sounds awesome, how do I enter?

Simple! Just write a couple of paragraphs about a sub you really like, and **comment them down below**! You can also send them to modmail if you wish. 

The only small caveat is to keep in mind our subreddit nomination guidelines: If a sub is tiny (<500) and/or super controversial, it'll probably not be chosen (i.e. don't write about your 3 week old sub with 2 posts and 5 subscribers). But that's just common sense really, so don't worry, just write about a sub you enjoy and it'll be fine.

Anyways, without further ado, let's get writing!

Let's move off the topic of prompt writing for now, and let's focus back on good old writing writing! When we think about fiction writing, the first thing we probably think of is writing a novel. A big overarching plotline, allegory, a shit load of words, etc, etc. The thing is, a novel is, like, a *lot* of work. It isn't the kind of thing you can just sit down one day and write for fun. My sources tell me it takes at least 2 days. And that's just too much effort for my liking. If only there was some form of writing a story, but it was short... Hmmm...

Oh wait a second there is [oh my god](https://gfycat.com/saltydazzlingfluke), it's /r/ShortStories! ^(yeah there's a reason why I stick to writing only these srotd things)

/r/ShortStories, as I'm sure you've gathered, is a sub for short stories. I mean, if you didn't work that out them I'm a bit concerned. If you're looking to find some cool fiction (or non-fiction) that doesn't take an hour to read, or if you've even got your own short story to post, this is the sub for you! There are a wide range of genres to be found here, from [mystery](https://redd.it/k67uhy) to [sci-fi](https://redd.it/ko1jt9) to [sheer fucking terror holy shit](https://redd.it/k67uhy), and many more beyond! It's just one of those rare subs that you can dive into and get lost in for hours. If you like reading and you like not being bored on the weekend with nothing to do, check out this sub!

In honour of this sub I will be keeping this story short. Plus, tomorrow's feature is going to be the big one, so stay tuned for that!

Following in the footsteps of /u/LoveTheSmallSubs, today I bring you a small sub that could definitely use some love. Being a moderator of SRotD, I'm often looking for subreddits in a similar -oftheday style to ours, where every day or week or month, a thing is done. It's a simple concept, but an effective one, if difficult to manage at times (relying on volunteers is naturally unreliable, even if those volunteers are all wonderful ~~shoutout to my SRotD writing squad~~). We here at SRotD are by far the largest of these types of subs, so when the opportunity arises, we feel it's only right to help out our smaller friends! For the fifth day of our Writing Week, we're looking at /r/PromptoftheDay.

/r/PromptoftheDay is a simple concept: Every day, a writing prompt (or sometimes multiple) is posted, for people to write about. That prompt can be in the form of text, or more often, an image. Aspiring writers might head on over to one of the big league writing subs, and just be overwhelmed by the dizzying amount of prompts and talent in them. Having a smaller sub, with only a few prompts for the community to focus on for a day, is a great way to ease people into the wonderful world of creative writing on the internet. Unfortunately, the sub is a bit small right now, and activity lacking, but all it needs is a bit of life blown into it, and it could definitely be an excellent place for writers on Reddit, aspiring and experienced! But even now, /r/PromptoftheDay is a sub that's definitely worth checking out, whether you're a writer or just someone who enjoys reading the work of talented redditors!

/r/WritingPrompts is a lovely sub, filled with talented writers. But having so many talented writers, writing these complex stories that often go into multiple parts and [sometimes even end up getting published](https://redd.it/5dkh21), based on plots that are usually very specific in detail by themselves, can make us smaller writers feel a bit constricted. Now restricting your writing can often be helpful for a multitude of reasons, but sometimes you don't want to write a masterpiece: You just want to sit down, relax, and write a simple story. That's where /r/SimplePrompts comes in.

/r/SimplePrompts is exactly what it says it is: It's a place to find simple writing prompts. No big plotline. Just enough detail to get the creative wheels turning, and really, that's all you need sometimes. It could be a [bit of dialogue](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplePrompts/comments/evkzwv/head_up_always_up_you_know_where_the_ground_is/), a [vague outline of a plot](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplePrompts/comments/czdnko/while_rummaging_through_the_attic_you_find_an_old/), or even just [a simple sentence](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplePrompts/comments/l2lx0y/a_cut_so_deep_yet_a_wound_so_thin/) to inspire you.

Whether you're a beginner writer looking to improve, a veteran /r/WritingPrompts user, or just enjoy a bit of creative writing, I'd highly recommend this small but welcoming community!

Unlike subreddits like /r/nosleep and /r/shortscarystories, /r/LibraryOfShadows doesn't focus purely on horror, but instead, suspense. If you've ever read (one of my favorite authors, /r/Lovecraft, then you'll know the type. The horror of The Nameless City wasn't too much, but the suspense was through the roof, which is what cemented it in my brain so many, many years ago. Being grossed out or horrified or afraid is great, but sometimes you just want to get reacquainted with the edge of your seat. That's where the Weird Tales-like Library of Shadows comes in.

This is a form of writing that I find hard to describe. I've never had the right words for it and I still don't, so I'm going to tell you what I tell everyone, which is to just go and read some of the top posts and get a feel for it. I recommend [Tales of Marlow, Pennsylvania](https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/7673ys/tales_of_marlow_pennsylvania/), written by /u/TheOldStag back in 2017. It's got the kind of suspense and mystery and vague horror that I love in a story and is something that I remember years later as being great for what it set out to do. If you like that story, check out some more, and then stare out a window into the night and pretend you didn't see something move...

Stay tuned for tomorrow, Day 4 of Writing Week, for something else entirely.

Welcome back, SSS! It's been a while since [your last feature in 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/787w68/october_23rd_2017_rshortscarystories_scary/). I remember it like it was yesterday. The birds weren't chirping, the grass wasn't green, and something went *bump* in the night, but it was only the guy I pay to pretend to be a teletubby and crawl around the yard.

As last time, /r/shortscarystories remains a subreddit wherein posters are given a word limit of 500 to write a scary story. You can consider it the bridge between /r/TwoSentenceHorror, where you have very limited space to make anything work, and /r/nosleep, where stories will go on for nineteen parts and then get paywalled behind an ebook. I prefer SSS (as all the cool kids call it, and I'm definitely cool) because I can dedicate just a few minutes to it at a time, so there's no big investment required. You can just open it up in the middle of the day, read a couple posts, and close it. Sure, you could watch The Shining for your scares, but if you've only got half an hour, an episode of Goosebumps is fine too.

It still does what it says on the tin. Come read some stuff and get spooked. Write some, too, if you feel like it, and get feedback from the users there on what you could do better. I was never too good at writing horror due to my need to explain everything. You see, my need to explain everything comes from a history of reading books while young which featured large worldbuilding, like Tolkien's, wherein answers to many questions- shit.

Alright, let's end this before I make a fool of myself for the ninth time. Stay tuned for Day 3 of Writing Week tomorrow when we check out something *weird*...

Welcome to Day 1 of Writing Week here on Subreddit of the Day. Every day for the next week we'll be focusing on subreddits related to writing, Earth's cheapest pastime. If you expect good advice, though, you're in the wrong place. Despite the adage being ""write often to improve"", I've been doing these features for about eight years and they still suck. Such is life.

First up is /r/KeepWriting, which is a snappy way of describing the advice in the title. Like any skill, writing is something you get better at the more you do. While it's definitely possible to [write a lot and still suck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._A._Salvatore), you'll definitely improve if you just keep it up. The people of /r/KeepWriting give advice, feedback, and motivation to fellow writers that go beyond ""just keep writing"", but that's my standard line. Whether you're crafting a sprawling fantasy world full of two-headed headless horsemen or telling a short tale of a cat looking out the window on a rainy day, they can help you out and let you know what you should consider doing. With diligence in your improvement and their assistance, you can reach the standard of an okay writer even if you began as an [absolutely terrible one that no one should subject themselves to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand).

Oh man, I'm not going to get off easy for that joke. That's why I'm a bad writer, you see. I made the sentence focus on something that isn't the content itself. Big mistake. If I'd have asked for feedback at /r/KeepWriting this might not have happened. Learn from my mistakes! Be greater than I could have ever dreamed of! Go, my child! Avenge me!

Stay tuned for Day 2 of Writing Week for something a little (but only a little) spookier.

/r/SubredditoftheDay are looking for new writers!,39,lfbktw,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/lfbktw/rsubredditoftheday_are_looking_for_new_writers/,8,"#[Here's the application form!](https://forms.gle/NuoDoVeT7BNS5U4Q8)

Hello everyone!

We all know that last year was a difficult one. Like, it doesn't need to be said. We here at SRotD struggled as well, and as a result we've had difficulty in keeping this sub at a standard we're happy with. We wish to fix this issue, so that all the wonderful subs we feature here can get their deserved time in the spotlight.

It's important that the SRotD team is comprised of many different people, as to prevent our own personal subreddit preferences from overly affecting what subs we feature altogether. Right now we're a bit short handed, so we're looking for the best of the best, the awesome-iest of the awesome (it's a word now shut up), ~~the will-write-features-for-food-iest of the will-write-features-for-food,~~ those valiant, talented, one in a million redditors* to come on and help out in the effort to make this sub be the best it can be. Yep, **we're recruiting interns!**

^(* I was originally going to link a gif from a scene in Django Unchained here but I think it'd be extremely tasteless so I'm just gonna let you imagine it, is that cool ok thanks)

#Intern? What is that?

The Intern Program sounds complicated, but it's not. Essentially, when we pick out potential future mods, we need to find the ones who really have what it takes to be a mod. So before adding them as full moderators to the sub, we put them through a small trial, letting them figure out the ropes before plunging them head first into the weird and wonderful world of ~~trying desperately to write a full sized feature 5 minutes before it's supposed to go up because you procrastinated for 2 weeks watching that new Netflix show you found~~ being a SRotD writer. It's a simple training course of sorts, and doesn't take long at all.

#Here's what you're signing up for when you become a writer:

* You get to feature subs that you enjoy and believe should be featured (unless the sub is objectively terrible, of course).

* You would be added as a moderator to /r/SubredditOfTheDay, a subreddit with over a *million* subscribers! 

* You get to participate in the secret Chinese Government shill projects, including such fun activities as censoring dissenters, enforcing communism by removing racial slurs, and censoring all photos mocking the glorious Xi Jingping! ^(what's that? You saw a photo on the front page of /r/all mocking him? uhhh... No you didn't)

#Requirements for becoming an intern

* Be somewhat active on Reddit, at least a few times a week

* Don't suck at writing features

* Don't be good at writing bad features

* Don't not feature subs that aren't good quality

&nbsp;

 That's it. No prior mod experience needed!

# What does the internship program entail?

* It's simple! Over a month long period, you need to write **3 features**, and process **one user-nominated feature**! Do that, and you're a mod of /r/SubredditoftheDay!

* In addition, you get access to all the cool backend subs of SRotD, so that's fun.

#What does being a moderator of SRotD entail?

* You are expected to write at least 1 feature a month. It's as simple as that! There's very little actual moderating required here, as, well, there's only 1 post a day.

/r/LowStakesConspiracies is essentially a shitposting subreddit where you can share your wild conspiracy theories that are low stakes and aren't super likely to get people upset at the mere mention of them. I could pick any post there as a good example, so just check out the front page of it to see what I mean.

This is another ""does what it says on the tin"" subreddit. Simply by browsing it for five seconds, you'll come to understand everything about it. There's nothing for me to do here, which is different from normal, when there's merely almost nothing for me to do here. So I'll entertain you with some low stakes conspiracies.

1. Pokemon was created by the government of Japan to make people want to raise cute things to try and get them to have kids. They won't make a Pokemon MMO because massively multiplayer procreation is considered immoral.

2. George Washington was named after the state. He was embarrassed of that fact, so the government covered it up.

3. Much like a genius alchemist hiding his secrets in a cookbook, the television series of Julia Child exists as a vehicle for the secrets of an ancient sect of French sorcerers, hiding their knowledge behind made-up foods like cassoulet and tartiflette that don't really exist.

4. James Cameron's Avatar was filmed on location, but was forbidden from disclosing that fact due to the Na'vi not being part of the SAG.

5. Amazon is the world's least successful South American travel agency, but they're going with the flow and pretending it was about books and stuff.

6. The Ms in M&Ms stand for ""Mars"" and ""Mercury"", which are its two main ingredients. They convinced you otherwise.

7. Subreddit of the Day is a ploy by Big Joke to exhaust all the bad jokes, leaving the good ones for its members.

8. Oranges weren't named after the color or vice versa. They were both named after Agent Orange, which looked delicious enough to name a fruit after. Previously, the fruit was called Dave. After the failure of the War in Vietnam, the US Government came up with a cover story.

9. German isn't real, you just think it is.

10. Time Travel and other ""transcendent technologies"" were banned at the First Council of Nicaea in 325AD, in order to prevent anyone from going back in time to 297AD and messing with Dave, a guy who was so great that they named a fruit after him. I mean, c'mon, Dave doesn't deserve to be hassled.

Get the idea? Come check out some more and contribute your own at /r/LowStakesConspiracies.

I like Doctor Who, though I've been taking a break from it for a while now. Watching the exciting adventures of the Doctor and his companions whizzing through time and space to cause and solve problems aplenty was awesome. Even if some episodes were... Well, remember Love and Monsters? Still, the majority of the series was good, and its funny moments are common. Even if the episodes have left behind their humble origins and become big productions, the campiness and bad special effects aren't going to completely disappear. It's a funny show.

And if you're a fan of it, you'll like /r/DoctorWhumour, where fellow fans share memes about the show. There's not much that needs said beyond that. Just go look at some funny chuckle rectangles and ha-ha your way to happiness. You want to be happy, don't you? This is the way. I know you were told that it's success, love, personal fulfillment, all that, but it's actually memes. I know, right? Get to consuming.

The general depiction of classical musicians is that they're all a bunch of elitist, stuck up hacks who think they're better than everyone else. And goal of this feature is to try and inform the masses that **all of it is true and jazz musicians are superior fucking fight me**

Just kidding, in reality all classical musicians are poor as fuck failed soloists in an oversaturated market that are kidding themselves that their diploma in the piccolo is actually worth anything and that they're not going to have to work at Starbucks the rest of their lives. That or they're failed composers in an oversaturated market, spending their off hours writing a classical era symphony for some stupid fucking reason as if anyone gives a SHIT about their wonderful use of counterpoint, and are kidding themselves that if they just write good enough contemporary music someone will eventually give a shit (because the public just *loves* listening to [stuff like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQHR_Z8XVvI)) and they'll become something, desperately trying to convince themselves that even if they do ""make it"" they'll be anything but a background music orchestrator for meagre pay and will need to get a real job anywa-

If you're like me, well I feel bad for you. One reason is that you're a giant weeb who stays up all night reading light novels and manga while you listen to smooth jazz and wonder what the touch of another human being feels like. Well, have no fear, because even horrible mutants like us can know the joy of love through the power of an otome game! Otome games, meaning maiden games, are dating sim visual novels targeted toward girls and women that typically involve romancing one (or all) of a cast of hunky princes, knights, heroes, and so on. They're stories that focus on romance, and typically involve fantasy tropes and worlds, though that worldbuilding is of much less importance than the act of romancing the main love interests themselves.

[Otome Isekai](https://www.reddit.com/r/OtomeIsekai/comments/jcimkn/what_is_otome_isekai/) is a newer genre in anime wherein the protagonist (almost always a woman; in fact, it may so far be always) is reincarnated into an otome game. According to what I can find out, as well as what a moderator there told me, the first series to do this was Hamefura, also called Bakarina, also called ""My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom"". It's the story of a 17-year-old otaku from Japan who is reincarnated as the villainess, or main antagonist, of an otome game called Fortune Lover that she'd been playing right before she died. She awoke her true memories at a young age and set about trying to avoid the Doom Flags, events which would lead to a Bad End for her character. Armed with god-tier charm, Katarina Claes transcends the pro Reverse Harem route and goes the Absolute Harem route without realizing it, attracting every sentient being to her with a friend-making power that would make Monkey D. Luffy look standoffish.

I love Hamefura. It's one of my favorite isekai series, and I just recently gave the jump to read the light novels, at which point I began binging the series. I'm literally, as I type this, taking a break to write this before starting volume 5. Unfortunately, I have little experience with [other otome isekai series, as seen here on their wiki list](https://www.reddit.com/r/OtomeIsekai/wiki/series). I don't read much manga, and 90% of what I do read is from anime I like or recommendations from a friend who isn't into this sort of genre, so I haven't come across much of it. The success of Hamefura in monopolizing my attention is making me regret this somewhat, and in the future I'll need to find some new series to read. This does mean that this feature will only mention that series; sorry, /r/OtomeIsekai, but I am a smooth brain with no other points of experience. Thinking this one about protecting the older brother may be next, but I don't know yet...

You could call it isekai for women, but that's a bit wrong, as [we don't gatekeep here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/la3o66/february_1st_2021_rimaginarygatekeeping_who_says/). Still, it absolutely focuses more on genres that women are interested in more than men, who tend to go more for the ""transported to a video game"" style of series that you see all the time. Personally, I get tired of the same thing over and over, so this is an exciting new genre for me, a manly manly man, to get into. Don't be intimidated; give it a try. The obvious recommendation here is Hamefura, which is slated for a second season later this year.

Then, when you're finished, come to /r/OtomeIsekai and talk about it. Tell us which characters are your favorites, [laugh at this thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/OtomeIsekai/comments/ladty9/you_ever_just_stumble_onto_something_stupid_and/), and tell me why (ain't nothin' but a heartache) you think the protagonist should definitely end up with your chosen pick of someone who's clearly wrong whose name rhymes with Shmeord.

Well, enough writing. Time to get back to reading. (Last minute edit: I binged all eight volumes. Gimme the ninth...)

*Using his beta capsule, Shin Hayata turns into ULTRAMAN*

Hailing from the faraway galaxy of Nebula M78, A gargantuan hero clad in red and silver has come to save the earth from giant monsters. Ultraman is a TV show franchise from Japan that has been spanning for more than 50 years and running since 1966 across countless spin-offs, universes and reboots. Although the show has a rich history and had its ups and downs, the premise has always remained simple. A giant of light who comes to Earth to save us from monsters and aliens. Some of them are friendly, some of them hold malicious intent. But whatever the case, Ultraman is always here to work together with humanity and save the day.

r/Ultraman is a place where fans from around the globe of all ages come to discuss the franchise and have fun watching their favorite hero wrestling with evil aliens from outer space. Ranging from fan-art, episode discussions as well as memes, r/Ultraman is a positive place for enthusiasts to gather together and share their love for the Ultra-Series.

With the franchise approaching its 55th anniversary in 2021, it's never been a greater time to be a fan of the Ultra Series. The series has been slated to have their own Marvel Comic book, a season 2 of it's Netflix original to be released this year, a high budget movie retelling to be released in early summer as well as official DVD's being sold around the US chronicling the adventures of Ultras old and new and their official YouTube channel which has been streaming exclusive Mini series subbed for free. Watching men in rubber suits duking it out with Monsters has never been easier.

As a moderator of both /r/SubredditoftheDay and /r/SubredditDrama, I *live* for the juicy drama. However, oftentimes regular ol' Reddit drama can just be all samey. One guy says abortion bad, another guy says abortion good, oh no, drama!!! It's fun in the same way that eating your favourite meal every day is. Like yeah, I enjoy it, but after a while you just want a little variety, you know?

Enter /r/HobbyDrama. I discovered this sub about 3 months ago, completely on random, and it was truly love at first sight. Excellent writeups. Fucking idiotic drama. Super specific hobby jargon that I absolutely do not understand but can still go along with because I'm just loving the vibe. I've learned about subcultures that I'd never even imagined existed, yet alone be this filled with petty bullshit. Like, who would have thought that fucking *sewing* was the most dramatic hobby of all?

You can find all sorts of exotic drama here, like [weird-ass Wikipedia drama](https://redd.it/dk17c9), [small penis roleplaying drama](https://redd.it/e4ubyu), [medieval underwear drama](https://redd.it/9l9ydd), the list goes on. Along with all that degenerate shit are writeups on some of the most memorable internet dramas of old, like the infamous [Snapewives](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/d4wwir/harry_potter_fandom_married_to_severus_snape_on/). [Neopets dev drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/j3me63/neopets_staff_member_is_revealed_to_have_a_pet/), and much, *much* more. Sometimes I wonder if modern society was a good idea, and looking at some of the [weird shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/d135s8/hamilton_fandom_the_hiv_high_school_aucannibal/) in this sub helps remind me that no, it wasn't. If you're a dramawhore like us in SrotD, this sub is a must read!

&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/PatronymicPenguin**: I can't remember how I found HD but I took an immediate liking to the format because I'm one of those people who loves writing and reading infodumps about new topics. High quality long-form content on Reddit is rare and this sub has it in spades. I started modding a couple of months after becoming a regular user. My motivation was to help shape how the sub evolved as it grew so that it would retain its level of quality even with more users coming in.

>> **/u/Cycloneblaze**: I've been reading the sub since [the original thread which got it started](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8p0pat/what_drama_is_currently_going_down_in_the_world/e08hjxn?context=3)! (Pretty cool that the founder is still around as our overlord!) I was fascinated by all the nuggets of drama from people passionate about things I had never heard about. I kept reading it ever since, and when they put up a call for new mods about half a year ago, Hobby Drama stood out as a sub I consistently enjoyed reading and that had a good community, such that I'd like to help make it better.

>> **/u/coffee-mugger**: I’ve been around since the beginning, when we were founded by a post on r/AskReddit. It was the [Snapewives]( https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/d4wwir/harry_potter_fandom_married_to_severus_snape_on/) and the [Stormy Daniels horse drama]( https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/b5eslu/horse_showing_stormy_daniels_and_the_1279_forum/) that really got me hooked.

>> **/u/foxehgirl**: I started following when it was started in the AskReddit thread (though I totally forgot that was where it started until I double checked the link Cyclone provided haha—my memory is a colander I swear but I knew I’d been around for ages). I’m pretty involved in the knitting/fiber community because of my job, so I am elbow deep in one of the most controversial hobbies all the time and figured I could be helpful when there was a call for mods. 

>> **/u/HypnoticSheep**: I was in the original AskReddit thread as well, and when Sand created the sub I sent over a quick message asking if he needed help modding. He added me onto the team, and I've been on since. As for the why, I just love hearing (or reading, as the case may be) about people's hobbies and interests. I love when someone talks (or writes, as the ca-- okay I'll stop) about a subject they're passionate about, and having a subreddit that's focused on not just in-depth descriptions of cool, niche hobbies, but also on major events in the history of that hobby? It's impossible to get that kind of window into these interests in any other way, I feel like seeing how a hobby community reacts to these major events gives a really interesting perspective on the community as a whole.

>> **/u/sand500** I created the sub from a comment the original AskReddit thread. Right away, I got some offers to help mod and setup the sub. As the sub was pretty small back then, which was enough to carry us for a while until we added the other mods. As far as why I created the sub, I loved hearing about all the wacky things happening in niche communities and I think its nice to have a dedicated space for those stories.  

> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/PatronymicPenguin**: For the most part, our users are very chill and respectful of the rules. We haven't had many problems and when there have been issues, the mod team is really good about talking it out as a group before making any public statements. We might be a drama sub but we keep the personal and sub drama as low as possible. I think our biggest ongoing challenge is finding the right line of what counts as enough consequences for a post to remain up. There's a balance that has to be struck between amazing writing with lesser consequences and not so great writing with major consequences, and we've gotten it wrong a few times. Personally, the only thing about the sub that really gives me a headache is when pro-shippers and anti-shippers get into it and start attacking each other. I'm strict about enforcing our rules against personal attacks and they always cross the line when that topic comes up in a thread.

>> **/u/Cycloneblaze**: Modding is pretty chill. The community is nice for the most part, and willing to work with us as mods. The other moderators have been very chill and helpful to me as the newbie. Where there are flare-ups they're mostly slap-fights and things which are easy to moderate. Questions which commonly come up are whether a particular post is a 'hobby' or not, or whether it's 'drama' or not, which are judgement calls that I'm still kinda getting my head around.

>> **/u/coffee-mugger**: It’s a pretty good time. r/HobbyDrama only averages a few posts a day at most, so I tend to read every post regardless of whether or not I’m modding. It was a bit tough in the chaos that was 2020, but I’m glad I’m in the role.

>> **/u/foxehgirl**: It’s super fun, for the most part. I’m probably a tad biased—most of my moderation comes in the form of organizing the weekly Hobby Scuffles and monthly Town Hall threads so I get to know the community and learn a lot about them. In the last year of quarantine, it’s been super cool to see the community grow and come together over a fondness for rubbernecking and finding ways to feel less isolated like a community YouTube music playlist or our comfort movie recommendations the week of 1/17ish. 

>> **/u/HypnoticSheep**: It's honestly pretty great. Our users are fantastic, and in general are happy to bring up issues at our Town Halls so that we can discuss rules and potential changes to them in a more public forum than modmail or reports. I've been taking a bit more of a backseat the past few months due to some personal things, but the rest of the team has stepped up and filled in- especially u/CycloneBlaze, who joined recently and hit the ground running. It really is a great team to work with

>> **/u/sand500** It is pretty chill.  All the mods discuss posts, rules, and feedback/ideas for the sub is our mod discord. I take a pretty hands-off role but pitch in here and there. This is only possible because the other mods are amazing. From enforcing rules, removing toxity, running events and responding to user feedback, they do a really great job so major thanks to them!

> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/u/PatronymicPenguin**: There's so many good ones to pick from! My personal top three are the [drama over a guy with a big 'unit' pretending it's small in a fetish group](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/e4ubyu/small_penis_humiliation_discord_is_it_okay_to/), [a tomato forum run like an increasingly unstable fascist state](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ipebo6/canning_food_the_tomato_invasion_of_2020_an/), and [how nuts some people get about their designer shoes](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/invbi4/tieks_i_dont_know_of_anyone_thats_been_shot_over/). Bonus shout-out to this [early post about groups enforcing medieval underwear](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9l9ydd/medieval_reenactment_groups_rejected_over_failure/).

>> **/u/Cycloneblaze**: Ooh, there's a lot. Lately I've been enjoying some of the series on the sub, like the UK football writeups with [this one about financial fraud that sank the most popular club in Scotland](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/kytmbn/). A couple classic favourites are [this crazy story about a dentist who fabricated an entire life as a marathon runner](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/enw2kd/running_dentist_who_won_west_wyoming_marathon/) and [this dude who completely abused zoological naming conventions to name over seven hundred species, mainly reptiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/aomwez/herpetologybiology_how_one_snakeman_has_abused/). And a few of my upvoted posts from the past include [tomato gardening](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/jeeu1s/gardening_tomatoville_has_lots_of_enemies/), [titty redirects](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/dk17c9/wikipedia_the_admin_who_created_80000_pages_about/), and [soup](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/jqp13z/soup_drama_the_borscht_identity/).

>> **/u/coffee-mugger**: As I mentioned above, my favourites are the Snapewives and Stormy Daniels horse drama.

>> **/u/foxehgirl**: Oh boy, I’m a sucker for the Snape and Frollo wives posts, though any of the fan Fic ones are fun. The one about the Re-enactors that banned anything modern, including feminine hygiene products, was wild as well. 

>> **/u/HypnoticSheep**: Boy, that's like picking a favorite kid. In that you love them all, but you know who your favorite is and it's SnapeWives. I will say though, it's really cool being able to talk to some of my friends who have very different interests than I do about major drama in their hobbies, thanks to write-ups in this sub.

>> **/u/sand500** I love posts on topics I know nothing about but this [Transformers](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/kho996/transformers_the_death_of_optimus_prime_how_toy/) drama holds a special place in my heart due to childhood nostalgia. 

> **4: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/PatronymicPenguin**: We're in a pretty stable state and we just finished our Best Of 2020 so we're not planning any major changes quite yet. We have been occasionally chatting about better definitions of what a hobby is but it's still an ongoing conversation. In general we like to bring any big updates to our users as a proposal before making the change, that way we can get input on it, like we did when we created the two week waiting period between drama occurring and being posted.

>> **/u/Cycloneblaze**: We don't have any concrete plans right now; we've been working on smoothing out our rules for a while as we grow, get more types of posts and gather feedback. I only joined in the middle of this, in fact 😄 We'd like to keep fostering a cool community and encourage interesting, on-topic writeups, so suggestions to help with that are welcome!

>> **/u/coffee-mugger**: As our subscriber count grows, I’m hoping that we can maintain the sub’s current high quality standard in writeups.

>> **/u/foxehgirl**: I think on my end, I am looking for ways to continue engaging and building the community in our weekly and monthly threads, but on the whole we are always looking for ways to keep the sub quality up as it grows. It’s been a process as we’ve grown, but I’m thankful for the rest of the mod team for the way we work together to figure stuff out. 

>> **/u/HypnoticSheep**: We have some events and improvements in mind that we're talking over, but no major changes are on the horizon. I feel like we have a great thing going so far, so while we're still workshopping some of the rules, it'll be tweaks here and there as opposed to wholesale rewrites. We do have a channel on our mod discord dedicated to brainstorming and working on future events though, so keep an eye out for some fun events in the future!

>> **/u/sand500** We frequenlty discuss the future of the sub but we don't have any concrete plans right now. We welcome suggestions, please post them in the recurring meta threads.

> **5: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/PatronymicPenguin**: I'd like to say thank you to all of our users! You are the ones who make our sub interesting and we appreciate all the effort you put into your writing and research!

>> **/u/Cycloneblaze**: I'm pleased to be working with my fellow mods and helping a nice subreddit. I'm learning a lot from it. And thanks for asking us these!

>> **/u/coffee-mugger**: I’m glad that you decided to feature our sub 😊

>> **/u/foxehgirl**: I’m glad you reached out and I’m super thankful for the rest of the mod team for being super awesome. I came out as a trans man months after I joined the team and they just rolled with it and didn’t make it a thing—my username is years old and doesn’t make sense with this information, but they’ve not made a big deal out of it. It’s meant more than I can say and honestly they have been one of the least stressful and most supportive (in a working relationship sort of way) section of my life right now.

>> **/u/HypnoticSheep**: Nope, but thanks for taking the time to put together this interview!

>> **/u/sand500** Thanks for reaching out!

[It's even funnier the second time!](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/l7swts/january_29th_2021_rwallstreetbets_to_the_moon/)

We here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay, being that we're all humans and we ought to all like seeing the uber-wealthy getting fucked over, love what's happening with WSB. We love it so much that we're breaking a nine-year tradition and giving it two days in a row. It's a heartwarming story about the commons fucking over the elite. It's a tale of everyone coming together and being the real Robin Hood they want to see in the world while simultaneously burning down the soulless diseased thing that recently misused that name. The whole thing is so heartwarming that I could roast marshmallows on my chest. I ought to get that looked at.

Wall Street deserves to be occupied. Ideally by bulldozers and rubble, but I'll settle for people with signs and masks in the short term. Who could've predicted that such a revolution would come at the hands of a subreddit that's only just evolved opposable thumbs?

Honestly, it's the funniest thing I've seen since that one guy turned himself into a pickle. If you need catching up, check out [yesterday's feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/l7swts/january_29th_2021_rwallstreetbets_to_the_moon/) which went into more depth. This feature is more of a memorial immortalizing the time when Reddit came together and made some rich people cry and scream. God, doesn't that just satisfy you to your core? It satisfies me. I can't afford to buy stocks, since all my poor people money is tied up in pasta and rice, but this is a win for all of us on the bottom, much like the invention of the ball gag.

You're a legend, /u/DeepFuckingValue. An absolute legend. May your glory be trumpeted far and wide and remembered in the history books as the architect behind the time when a bunch of morons fucked the investing industry.

Glory to you, /r/wallstreetbets. I've never respected a subreddit more. Your brains may be smooth, but your hearts are strong. May you hold forever, you beautiful idiots.

**~~3,128,477~~** **~~4,679,462~~** **5,916,497** degenerates *HOLDING* for **9 years!**  
  
Okay, before we start this feature, I want to make two things clear. One: This is not financial advice. I think that should be pretty clear and if you're the sort of person to take financial advice from a Subreddit Of The Day post, you have bigger things to worry about. Two: I have literally no clue what's going on. While I think I have a bare-bones understanding of the whole situation, at the end of the day I am economically illiterate, so if I make any mistakes don't bully me too hard.  

/r/wallstreetbets is a land of wife's boyfriends, YOLOs, FOMOs, 🌈🐻s, among other things. The community description - ""Like 4chan found a bloomberg terminal illness."" - is fairly accurate. Recently, as you probably know, it has **exploded** in popularity - as of writing this right now there's almost a million users on the page at the moment, and the subscriber count has gone up by a few hundred thousand in the time I've been writing this so far. I go on Twitter, and #EatTheRich is trending alongside #RobinhoodApp and ""Wall Street"". I turn on TV, and they're talking about this subreddit on CNN. The mod team [even has a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/wsbmod) made a few days ago that is close to 600k followers AND is verified. When it comes to the title of ""Subreddit Of The Day"", this subreddit has got to be the most worthy in a while. The year is 2021 and Tucker Carlson is agreeing with AOC, who agrees with Donald Trump Jr. and Ted Cruz, who both agree with Ilhan Omar. And they're all agreeing on a subreddit being based. This is so far outside the normal realm of comprehension.  

[**GameStop: Power To The Players**](https://twitter.com/dril/status/381474795310702592)
  
Here's an abridged version of the story - I'm sure a lot of you know the gist already and as said there's already [extensive media coverage](https://www.google.com/search?q=wallstreetbets&tbm=nws) out there. A Redditor known as [/u/DeepFuckingValue YOLOd 50k on GameStop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7eq9p/please_pay_respect_to_rdeepfuckingvalue_and_where/), and now sits on tens of millions in profit. Why GameStop? Well, to ~~plagiarise~~ quote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6uo8q/gamestop_update_part_2_power_to_the_players/): ""This is about more than GameStop, this for many it is about what GameStop represents. A small company struggling on its own finds itself in the sights of billionaire hedge fund managers mid COVID. The hedge fund owners [short (bet the stock goes down)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/572474190016413706/804552446197628988/Screenshot_20210129-032352_Twitter.jpg) over 100% of the stock (making it nearly impossible to go up), the goal is to destroy an already struggling company quickly, and turn a quick buck. GME is the 'everyman' of publicly traded companies and the hedge fund elite are out to crush it. DFV posted a very well thought-out and thorough video of his research, including the fact GameStop e-commerce grew over 309%, and here we are as sub count has rocketed to 3 million users in days *(it's closing in on 6 million now!)* & [the price skyrocketed from $4 to over $300 in a few months](https://i.redd.it/85xtgfa946e61.gif).""   

Somehow, it seems as if this situation is simultaneously a meme and wholly serious for WSB now. It is not only a bit of a meme stock, but also a huge (and I'm talking [King Kong Balls](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g274707-d18154163-Reviews-King_Kong_Balls-Prague_Bohemia.html) HUGE) ""fuck you"" to Wall Street professionals/hedge funds like Melvin Capital. And then there's [the RobinHood fiasco](https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/712708069369782272). A trading app with the slogan ""Let the people trade"" restricts trading in GameStop. Funny how that works. However, as some have pointed out, this could be [a blessing in disguise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect): EVERYONE is now talking about GME. Any talk about GME is good talk, they fucked themselves trying to silence it but did the opposite. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  
  
RobinHood can restrict trade, the Financial Times can [suggest wsb is somehow aligned with the alt-right for being on Reddit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/572474190016413706/804704904189837352/Esz24tqVkAAIJYL.png) (seriously, wtf?), but one simple fact remains - to sum this all up in three words:

**546,363** collectors *spinning the black circle* for **13 years!**  
  
Since the late 2000s, a spectre has been haunting the Western world — the spectre of the vinyl revival. A format since the 50s, the vinyl record's presence has been growing year on year. In fact, [2020 marked the best year for the format in the UK since the 90s](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/vinyl-sales-2020-best-selling-b1779570.html), and it's only growing. As someone who was born when LP sales were almost at their lowest point, the format has always seemed cool and oddly contemporary to me. I picked up my first record player a few years ago (and since upgraded, it was one of those [rubbish cheap ones stuck in a briefcase - avoid!](https://youtu.be/AXV8tXrPOR4)), and my collection has only rapidly expanded since.  
  
/r/Vinyl is a great subreddit dedicated to the aforementioned format. The sidebar has a lot of good info including the [*Community Resource: Useful Links, Guides, and Threads*](https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/854ria/community_resource_useful_links_guides_and/?st=jevkvqga&sh=509bd73), and pinned at the top of the sub is the [weekly questions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/l61hy1/weekly_questions_thread_for_the_week_of_january/). Having lurked and left the occasional question on this sub from the time I was a complete newbie (which I still kinda am), in my experience this subreddit has been nothing but helpful. As with all hobby/interest subs it can always seem as if some people forget that we were all new to it at one point, but generally if you take on board advice given and remember that the plural of vinyl is *not* vinyls, the /r/vinyl community is welcoming for anyone whether they've been collecting all their life or if they just want to find out what the old spinny music format is.  
  
Types of posts include [pictures of setups](https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/l6neh5/my_safe_space/) to [record store hauls](https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/l6djp3/haul_from_the_record_store_only_20/). One of my favourite parts about this subreddit is the rule that ""photo and image posts as well as gifs and short videos must also include a 300+ character description, story, or review of their content"". This keeps the discussion alive, keeps the subreddit from becoming just a picture board, and also means that I can enjoy a post and find a haul cool even if I have no clue what the albums/artists are.  
  
Here to talk more about themselves and the community is a moderator of /r/vinyl!  
  
>#1. How did you come to be a mod of /r/vinyl?  
  
>> I was a subscriber for some time and the mods at the time asked for volunteers to help moderate the sub a couple of years ago. I was selected.  

>#2. What is it like moderating the subreddit?  

>> There is quite a bit of redirecting folks asking common questions over to the thread Intended for that purpose. We have some post requirements with an automoderator that helps, and subscribers often need help getting their posts up. Most folks are just here to chat and have a good time, but from time to time there are some that have a REALLY strong opinion on this or that that need to be calmed down. Overall, it’s pretty fun to help out.  

>#3. What is it about the vinyl format that draws you in?  

>> The overall experience. The ritual. The nostalgia. The thrill of the hunt. Sharing them with my family. The fact that you’re never done upgrading your setup, and there is always new music to check out. Honestly, it’s just fun. Oh, and of course the unreasonable expense and inconvenience.  

>#4. The term ""Holy Grail"" is sometimes used on the sub, both sarcastically and seriously, do you find it true that most people have one? What's yours?  

>> I’m pretty sure that term no longer means what it once did. I think most people look at it as something they really want, or maybe something that just costs a lot. I think it used to mean something very unique and almost impossible to obtain. I have a number of records that took a while to find, and some that I paid too much for, but I’m not sure I’ve actually found a grail yet. I do have some alerts on my Discogs account to hopefully get my white whale someday.    

>#5. Anything else you would like to add?

Don't bother me for a link to Big Tiddy Hitler-oneechan Ero Dating Sim. You expect a lucky prospector to share his hard-won gold?

/r/BadYTAds is a burgeoning community of users who share bad ads they're served on YouTube. Being that YouTube has fought hard these past few years to silence channels that ~~speak heresy against the Imperial canon~~ say naughty words like Ass or Coronavirus, you'd expect their digital Puritanism to extend to what makes them money, right? Wrong. Money is the sole arbiter of morality for a corporation, as an entity that exists with the same relationship toward money as humans have toward senses, emotions, desires, and oxygen. Advertising scams, malware, and Elsa/Spider-Man footscat mpreg vore are all good so long as the children you're targeting earn you money.

Unless your name rhymes with Snackie Chan, you're probably not fast enough to track the wings of a hummingbird in flight. Much like heavier-than-air flight and the construction of Phoenix, AZ, mankind's hubris has extended to the creation of the high speed camera, which can slow down such speedy occurrences and allow us to look at what's going on in those blurs of movement. For instance, the high speed Zapruder film clearly shows JFK's head detaching to fly home to the planet of Old Jersey, thus requiring a convenient cover story...

On /r/SlowMotion, fans of looking at fast things being not-fast share moving pictures of slow motion video, like gunshots and birds and [crocodiles wiggling themselves into the air](https://www.reddit.com/r/SlowMotion/comments/l1j6cn/slomo_crocodile_out_the_water/).

The Sopranos is a TV series that ran on HBO from the years of 1999 to 2007 and focused on the life of Tony Soprano, a mobster in New Jersey with an old-fashioned mindset and a rapidly evolving modern world. The series won loads of awards and during syndication was popular with everybody who had HBO. The introduction was going to end there, but wouldn't you know it, they're making a prequel? The Many Saints of Newark will be premiering sometime this year (IMDb says September 24th, but this isn't a stable year for movies) and will tell the story of a young Tony Soprano getting his start in the mob business. It'll be starring Michael Gandolfini, the son of James Gandolfini, who played Tony in the series. It's also got Corey Stoll as Junior Soprano, along with some other odd choices that I wouldn't have predicted. I remain hopeful, as it's being directed by Alan Taylor, the director behind Thor: The Dark World, Terminator Genisys, and the one which erases those two from his shame, one of the best episodes of Season 7 of Game of Thrones, Beyond the Wall.

If Paulie gets a flaming sword I swear to God...

So, The Sopranos has a bit of a fan community. It's endlessly quotable, has 86 episodes worth of things to discuss, and if your fan theories are really accurate, some nice Italian men stop by your house and kill your dog. Good luck, guys, I'm behind 7 proxies! And I have nothing worth breaking to prove a point. No, not even legs. They're mostly decorative.

/r/TheSopranos is Reddit's place for it all, aside from the shitposting that is /r/CirclejerkSopranos, something a fan of the show should also check out. Unlike a lot of series subreddits, /r/thesopranos is mostly self posts for discussion, questions, and complex mathematical analysis of how Sylvio gets his hair to do that. Oh, and so-funny-it's-bad text attempts at the show's Italian-American slang and accents. I'm not Italian, nor do I play one on TV, so I'm about as qualified as anyone else to try, but I won't. Don't worry, it's fine.

You've probably seen the show, right? If not, go watch the show. It's one of those shows that gets brought up alongside The Wire, Breaking Bad, and Oz as the must-see series of the last few y- holy shit 1999 was so long ago. Fuuuuuuu-

If you feel yourself aging rapidly, step back into the 1990s with characters who want it to be the 1950s. It's fun, you'll like it. Just don't expect positive role models. Practically everyone's an asshole, but then, they're mobsters, so that's to be expected. Yeah, a few people are kind of alright, but they're typically side characters. Watch the series, then come discuss which of them isn't as big of a prick as they could've been. Maybe, if every single one of you watches it, we can finally figure out how Paulie and Christopher got played by some interior decorator. I mean, really? Still, he did kill those Chekyoslavokyans.

You know how many times I had to further ruin that word until my autocorrect would stop correctly guessing it? This is a tough job.

"January 24th, 2021 - /r/Candlemaking: There's something appealing about setting something on fire just to smell it burn, isn't there?",194,l3zysh,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/l3zysh/january_24th_2021_rcandlemaking_theres_something/,4,"#/r/Candlemaking 

**26,684 readers** for **9 years!**

I like a good scented candle. My places typically smell like laundry detergent, so I find ways to change it up for some reason. There's the old ""baking a teaspoon of vanilla extract in an open oven"" trick, and similar, but candles work, too, and don't leave your house smelling like a bunch of cheesecakes had an adult party all over your walls. Plus, burning things is fun.

The wise fellows of /r/candlemaking aren't lazy people like me who just buy a bunch of cheap stuff with appealing names online and light them up. They make their own stuff, by combining wax with fresh ingredients and wicks and the crafting skill of Hephaestus, at least when compared to me. It's actually not difficult at all, though. This is one of the very few times when I can actually perform the hobby being featured without accidentally dismembering myself. I won't regale you with the circumstances of learning to make candles, but I learned. It's fun, even, and who doesn't love playing with hot wax? In a crafting setting, I mean. Don't make me bonk anyone.

The general idea: Heat wax. Combine wax (of which there are different kinds, so look for that) with some oil or something to give it a scent. Pour into a glass mold/container. Insert a wick. Let cool. You now have a candle. I don't suppose it's much different for tallow candles, if anyone's even still making those in the age of electronics and indoor plumbing. Apparently soap making is the same process, but I've never made soap, only strategically dropped it as a form of backdoor venus flytrap maneuver.

It's a fun hobby that I'm surprised hasn't seen a huge uptick during lockdown like bread making went through. We all want our places to smell good, right? Right now mine smells like, well, laundry detergent. I may just try and make some candles soon to change that. Let's hope my eternal badness of doing things doesn't lead to me being beheaded, exiled, inseminated, and declared unfit for office.

Head on over and check out /r/candlemaking for some examples and tips on how to get started. You can also check out /r/candles for recommendations and reviews on similar things.

Well, let me explain how it all works...",183,l3ckln,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/l3ckln/january_23rd_2021_rshittyfantheories_you_dont/,2,"#/r/ShittyFanTheories 

**28,983 readers** for **8 years!**

Did you know that Subreddit of the Day and /r/ShittyFanTheories exist in the same universe? I didn't, but apparently [it's been long-established](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/19mz9s/subreddit_of_the_day_and_rshittyfantheories_exist/). I don't know what you're supposed to do with this knowledge.

/r/ShittyFanTheories is a subreddit wherein people share theories of stories that require only three tenths of a brain cell to work out. If you put more than five seconds of thought into any of them then you've seriously misunderstood the premise. Let me show you an example.

Gandalf is an allegorical retelling of the Tortoise and the Hare story with a strong Turkish undertone. The evidence for this is that Gandalf gets to a place after Sauron but still wins and has a beard.

Go ahead and pick it apart. I don't even know what I just wrote. No brainpower was involved in the creation of that statement.

You want a shitty fan theory? Here you go:

Mario is Natsuki Subaru from Re:Zero who has been reincarnated not into the world of Re:Zero, but into the Mushroom Kingdom by way of a similar powerful magical being: Kamek, who summoned ""Mario"" from another world in order to become a hero and defeat Bowser. Bowser is not even a true villain, but was conscripted to transformation and evil, like the koopas, by Kamek, who rules behind the scenes as something of an avatar of chaos, not desiring political power or anything, just entertainment. He controls Bowser as the villain to watch Mario run through the gauntlet like a hero, over and over and over, the only one who can see his many deaths. As for why Mario has to be Subaru? Because Mario can't speak more than a tiny amount of English and is clearly a huge [s-word I can't use without Twitch banning me]. Also, Luigi isn't a real person, he's a spirit. The toads are just regular toad people, though. Yoshi's normal, but he only misses games like SM64 because he's doing time for tax evasion. Don't worry, he's rich, so it's like a vacation resort with a light prison theme.

Anyway, that's the gist of /r/ShittyFanTheories. Come up with a shitty fan theory, share it, and defend it to the death in the comments. Just don't be the person who does the ""but X was in a coma/dreaming all along"" theory for the billionth time. Unless you're referring to Mario, who did have a game where the whole thing was in his dreams, and another where it was all a play. Natsuki Mario-kun's fair game.

What are your favorite shitty fan theories? Let me know so I can turn them into ""Epic True Confirmed Theory Compilation You Won't Believe #5!!!"" for my second job as a writer for Crappy Clickbait Thieves Inc, a subsidiary of Buzzfeed.

I had to learn how to properly clean the hard way. Growing up, the only thing we cleaned was our sleeping bags, since we didn't have electricity, running water, or walls without holes in them. My uncle, later on, would drill me like I was in the army or something, which I hated, but am glad for now. Still, that only teaches you so much, and it's possible that you could be the best at mopping but not know a damn thing about getting wine stains out of cotton or something. Well, following after a child can teach you many things, including what really counts as a stain and what you can ignore, but mostly it's how to clean up everything.

And now that we're in the future, we've got /r/CleaningTips. Full of wise cleaning sages, they're the college freshman's other best friend. With a huge backlog of tips and answers to countless questions, there's probably no stain, surface, or problem the subreddit can't teach you to clean up. Well, Reddit's search leaves a lot to be desired, so you may need to ask yourself, especially if you have an odd request. Just remember: All blood is pig's blood until proven otherwise, and if proven otherwise, just politely ask for a lawyer and say nothing else.

Seriously, subreddits like these are a treat. They're incredibly useful, especially to young people or those without parents who taught them these things. It should be part of a care package given to new adults alongside voter registration instructions and therapy coupons. To those of you who contribute helpful information to /r/CleaningTips, I can only say thank you from the me of the past. If only you'd been around twenty years ago and stopped me from making dumb mistakes. I won't even tell you with tales. They're embarrassing.

So come check it out. First, though, make sure to vacuum your carpets. It's about time.

I have an old person mindset with YouTube content creators. I'll watch a lot of somebody, binge their back catalog, and then grow bored by them quickly. The ones I do keep up with are rare, and among them, I typically don't watch everything they make. Only a few channels have received the highest award I can bestow, which is to use youtube-dl to just download their videos so that I don't waste bandwidth rewatching them every so often. Among these chosen few, one stands supreme, victorious, and gloriously bearded.

Let me say it: I love Ross Scott. Like Midas, he turns everything he touches to gold, but it's gold seeped in madness, so it's got strange alien engravings, sounds suspiciously like Black Sabbath, and is covered in bean juice. Like beef wellington whose innards are not beef but numerous eyes who speak a strange language, Ross is an advocate for the infinite strangeness of life, where one can peel back the curtain and look at the chaos that governs what pretends to be ordered. If he were revealed to secretly be a member of a Lovecraftian cult I would not be too surprised. This is the kind of mind-bending stuff I love to see, and coupled with witty and insane humor, it's no wonder I love everything he makes. If I were a more annoying person, my shamelessly perfect knowledge of Freeman's Mind would make me a nightmare to talk to with how endlessly quotable it is. I don't want to be that guy.

The only thing I can tell you to do is [to watch some of his Game Dungeon videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/chilledsanity/videos). There's nothing else to say when it comes to it. Either the video hits your soul and you join the cow cult or it doesn't. I'm a believer, so I can't put myself in the shoes of others, but I imagine you'll get it within a couple of videos. His humor probably isn't for everyone, but if it's for you, it'll be like a breath of fresh air after breathing nothing but swamp gas forever. Ross's weird is what explorers spent the better part of the past three centuries searching for. We found it, guys. You really messed up looking in Antarctica and stuff and not the internet.

If you like his humor, or if you're a fan of machinima and somehow haven't seen it, give his Freeman's Mind series a try. Even beyond his other machinima projects like Civil Protection, it's my gold standard for machinima and what it can be as a creative medium. Being a big Half Life fan, it also permanently changed the way I approach those games, and I'll never be able to play them now without constantly thinking about how The Greater Gordon would do things. I'm not the only one, either, as fellow fans of /r/AccursedFarms more or less think in the same vein as I do.

Unlike most Youtuber fan subreddits, /r/AccursedFarms is *not* just fanart of Ross as the antagonist of [Castle Crashing the Beard](https://newgrounds.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Crashing_the_Beard), even though it could be. It's primarily discussion of the channel's contents, the creator, and predictions on the future of the various series he makes. I know, crazy. Of course, there are still plenty of memes, jokes, and reference talk, but it's not an absurd amount in comparison. Maybe it's because Ross's videos tend to be a bit more demanding of the viewer, or because he himself is like a spectral cave goblin who only fades into our world to impart wisdom and then disappears, but it's not like comparable fanbases who spend most of their time talking about social media feuds and asking him to play Minecraft. I like that.

Alright, then. Give it a shot. Hopefully you can find the magic.

Oh, as an afterthought: While looking over this one last time for editing, Ross made a guest appearance in the video of another youtuber I love, /r/Civvie11, whose name you won't be seeing the last of here. Good. He needs to be in more things. I want to turn on a cooking show and see Ross stuffing a turkey full of little gummy gnomes while the hosts try to remember what the number is for the Eastern European police. (Hint: It doesn't matter. They're not coming.)

**108,054 readers** for **11 years!**

To put it simply, fan fiction (which is the last time I'll put a space between fan and fiction) is fictional writing written by a fan. It takes an existing series that fans love and expands on it in non-canonical stories written by the fans themselves. Sometimes these stories are incredible epics with far more effort put into them than their original stories themselves and with peerless lengths whose fictional girth rivals a teen boy hyping himself up on AOL Instant Messenger. Some are self-insert Teletubbies vore fics. We don't talk about those.

Being a terrible author myself, I understand the draw of fanfiction. I've written a couple of terrible fics that I'll keep buried in my embarrassing subconscious as they were pretty bad. So I get it, fanfic authors. I know you. I know the irresistible draw that makes you read about some background character in Harry Potter and want to write a twelve-part hero's journey where they recover a lost treasure and defeat an evil sorcerer. We've all been there.

And it's on /r/FanFiction that such like-minded sorts gather. Not only are they the ones writing the stories, but reading them, reviewing them, recommending them, and printing them out to serve as evidence in court. Though the community has changed over the years, it's fundamentally the same one that I dipped my toes into back in the early 2000s. It's gotten better, as a matter of fact. On the main subreddit, they've got daily threads for sharing and discussing just about everything, a discord server, comprehensive wiki, an FAQ and glossary for newcomers (and for us old people who just don't pay attention or remember too well), and various events that come and go throughout the year. It's a welcoming place in many ways, but even just mechanically, it's a good entry point to the genre.

While preparing for this feature, I decided I'd pick a random fanfic from a series that I love and give it a read, just for fun. Man, there's a story for *everything*, huh? You wouldn't expect the King of the Hill categories to be so full of activity, but I guess everyone's favorite Texanime has that appeal.

Anyway, it's a good sort of folk, and for writers (even us atrocious ones), it's a piece of where most of us came from. Why not show us that embarrassing Transformers/As Told By Ginger slashfic you wrote back in 7th grade? We're all dying to read it.

Eleven years? Wow, congratulations are in order for that alone. Most of the subreddits from that era either blew up into cesspools or got discarded because their mods forgot they existed. Keeping one active and not full of feet pics spam is an achievement.

Cryptozoology. For my generation, that word brings to mind images of Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, their flashlights in the dark forest as they search for something the likes of which Generic Small Town Sheriff is adamant doesn't exist. They looked at or mentioned most major ones, like Bigfoot, the Jersey Devil, the Loch Ness Monster, and you, the reader, ticking most horrific antisocial animals off the list early on through the first season or two. I don't know if cryptozoologists appreciate the fame from The X-Files, but I can't imagine they mind the uptick of interest in their field.

Now, this isn't my usual theme. I don't, personally, believe in the existence of those guys I mentioned. Some are more plausible than others, but I'm firmly unconvinced. That's not why I'm here. I'm featuring /r/Cryptozoology because it is an example of something I absolutely love: Passion for a hobby or interest from a dedicated community. I could spend hours reading about, say, two hardcore vacuum cleaner people talking about their love of some obscure Swedish vacuum engine. Truthfully, I have no idea who some of these crypto-creatures are, but I enjoy reading people talk about them, anyway.

Plus, being a big Lovecraft fan, I love humoring the idea of strange, unknown creatures lurking in the dark. Maybe this is an excuse to talk about the time I found a strange skull in the woods that nobody could identify, but I'll leave that for later. The point is, weird shit exists in the world and I don't claim to be smart enough to comprehend even a sliver of it. Maybe Bigfoot's out there doing whatever a bigfoot does. Probably not, but it's not like it bothers me either way. So long as there's doubt I get to listen to people's interesting theories.

Anyway, this one's for you, /r/Cryptozoology. Bonus props will be given to anyone who can tell me about an interesting creature in Pennsylvania. I'm referring specifically to cryptozoological creatures, not Terry from the dumpster behind Wendy's who eats tires. He's a well-documented abomination, which is different.

What is /r/TheNightFeeling?

It's a quiet summer night, warm outside. Warm enough to have a window open but cool enough that a hoodie is comfortable. A breeze rustles the leaves of a tree outside before brushing by your face. A single car passes by, maybe on a neighborhood street or on a highway off in the distance. The night air has a particular smell, gentle, but one that's only detectable when the rest of the world goes to sleep. You feel like you're one of only a few awake. You're alone, but not lonely. Maybe you just sit there and stare out into the night. Maybe there's a light, off toward the horizon. The world is asleep around you and you're left to wonder at the majesty of it all. You should feel tired, should want to crawl into bed under the covers... but you can't tear yourself away from the night.

/r/TheNightFeeling is a subreddit for that nostalgic melancholic feeling that comes over you when you drive alone at night, or watch a city skyline at dusk with the wind in your face. It's a subreddit for the feeling you get when you're lonely but peaceful, content but sad, and homesick for something you can't quite remember. 

Three examples of /r/TheNightFeeling content:

Nestle, the corporation that has [been boycotted fiercely by international groups since 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestlé_boycott) due to how disgusting their practices are.

/r/FuckNestle is a subreddit which exists to discuss (and meme about) the reasons why every human, animal, plant, and Vogon from the planet Vogsphere should hate this infuriating monument to humanity's collective self-loathing. Nestle is a glowing (from the pollutants) example of the incredible danger presented by the empowerment of corporations over the people. This is what freedom to callously kill, enslave, and destroy does: It leads to killing, enslaving, and destroying. Who'd have guessed that?

This sort of thing should make everyone sick. That any human could support their actions, and proudly defend child slavery and death, creates such a feeling of disgust for the human race that I almost want the Earth to be demolished to build a hyperspace bypass. We don't deserve a planet.

Come be angry with the rest of us at /r/FuckNestle, and catch up [with the informative stickied post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckNestle/comments/hmv0nv/the_reasons_why_we_hate_nestle_so_much/). There's anger to spare, so dive in and let the hate flow through you.

Komi Can't Communicate is a manga series starring the eponymous Komi Shouko, AKA Komi-san. Komi has a communication disorder that makes talking extremely nerve-wracking, and is constantly anxious about it. Enter Tadano Hitohito, a kind boy with a big heart who wants to help Komi face her fears and make a hundred friends. The character list is vast and diverse, which is half the fun of the series. Komi-san is a manga that can be called ""slice of life"", though officially, it seems to be ""comedy/romance"". If you need your manga to include at least one demon-infused ninja, brain-damaged alien warrior, or powerless-turned-powerful hero student, this may not be for you. If you want to feel warm and fuzzy inside, though, look no further.

Such applies to the community of /r/Komi_san. It's a friendly sort, drawn together by the love of looking through the window into the lives of these characters and seeing them do all kinds of wholesome things. There are the debates, but there is a consensus in most things, like that Tadano (AKA Chadano, AKA Tadano-kun-chan) is awesome, that Najimi's only true pronoun is Najimi, and that if Komi-san's adapted to an anime, Komi must be voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto. Well, I may have made that last one up. Still, it's a corner of the manga sphere of Reddit that stays consistently nice no matter the circumstances. There's probably a proverb I could use about the tide or the wind or something to illustrate this in a more clever way, but I'm a simple man.

Come on by and take a look. We're up to 284 chapters right now (assuming one doesn't come out while this is unpublished) and eagerly awaiting the next. Read the first few if you're new to it, and if you like it, do what I did and binge the series with such unbreakable interest that the next time you come home it'll be to an intervention. Trust me, it's worth it.

Tanya von Degurechaff, named mage 'White Silver' of the Empire, is everyone's favorite war criminal. She's terrifying. To put it into perspective, she's the most terrifying person in Isekai Quartet, overshadowing the Supreme Overlord of Death, Ainz Ooal Gown, who visibly recoils in fear the first time they talk. What makes adorable little Tanya so frightening is her mentality: She will kill you and feel nothing but second-hand embarrassment at the Empire's waste of resources that was your life. She is a stone-cold badass motherfucker with the power of a demigod and the body of a child. This is highly abnormal.

Tanya von Degurechaff was originally a Japanese salaryman who was killed by being pushed in front of a train. She was reincarnated into a parallel world akin to World War I as a child within a monarchic Empire reminiscent of Emperor Wilhelm II's Germany. In this world, magic is real, and like any humans with magic, it's been studied and boiled down to a science, albeit a somewhat inexact one. Rather than spiritual energy and the power of friendship, magic works through computations and can be predicted like any science (with one notable exception). Tanya was sent to this world because she is an atheist who refused to believe that the so-called ""God"", Being X, who reincarnated her, is truly a god to be worshiped. Being X wanted her to develop faith, and began testing her to do so. Part of this was making it so that her uber-powerful computation jewel used for magic not only functions despite it being ~~a piece of shit~~ German engineering, which is the best in the world, but making it only work through prayer. To activate her high level power, she has to pray to God, which pisses her off.

From the perspective of others, Tanya is a child (beginning at 9, I'm not sure how old she is later on off the top of my head) who embodies the greatest ideals of the Empire, and is considered an ace mage in the military at such a young age. She's even been awarded the Silver Wings Assault Badge, the highest honor that a soldier can receive, and which is nearly always awarded to corpses due to the absurdly high bar by which it can even be considered to be handed out. She is, without a doubt, the perfect soldier. Intelligent, powerful, loyal, hardworking, and inspires both intense loyalty and fear in her subordinates. This is in spite of the fact that, privately, Tanya just wants to obtain a quiet life in the safety of the Empire's heartland and live out her days in comfort to spite Being X, who intends on killing her through convoluted ""mysterious ways"", as gods tend to work in. Tanya's no pushover, God or no, and will shoot his immortal ass dead if he shows himself. God, I love Tanya. She'd get along well in the [Warhammer 40k setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/YoujoSenki/comments/krhify/cant_find_artist_but_man_40k_youjo_senki_is_being/).

I've actually started reading the light novels for this one. I'm only on the first, though, as it's a very dense read and I don't always have the attention for it. It's great, and I love the focus on conversations, though the battle parts read like an actual wartime play-by-play, which I'm sure a lot of people love. I'm not a military otaku or anything, so I don't really need that level of detail, but I respect it. It's a brilliant series that I've been dying for more of. We got a movie, which was good (and canon, I believe occurring just after season 1, but I'm not sure), as well as Isekai Quartet and some side stories in the same art style, but no season 2. The manga is actually behind the anime, it seems, but I haven't kept up with it.

Well, if you want to hang out with the cool kids on /r/YoujoSenki, you may want to try the light novel. It's not required or anything, but it's a good read, and you won't get accidentally spoiled by anything if someone forgets a spoiler tag. It can be a bit confusing, given all the characters and other names, so I recommend you keep the wiki up while you read. Just remember: Tanya von Degurechaff's the sociopath, Viktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakov is the cinnamon roll, and God's a dick. When you get through watching the anime or catching up on the novels, check out some fan art. Some of the comics people make for the series are hilarious. As a huge Overlord fan, [I particularly like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/YoujoSenki/comments/euelag/i_typeset_the_tanya_and_ainz_comic/).

Alright, enough lazing around on the Empire's dime. Get back to work.

According to my watchlist for completed anime, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the only anime series (or movie) which I've [scored a perfect 10/10](https://i.imgur.com/QWVJhyQ.png). Totally deserved. I'll defend the statement in the title to the bitter end: It's the best. Don't even try coming in here telling me that well actually Wise Man's Grandchild is way better and is only underrated because people are too caught up on things being good or something. I'll accept plenty of things as close seconds, but not first. FMA has an iron grip on first place. I guess you could say a.... Fullmetal grip? Eh? EH? Laugh, damn you.

/r/FullmetalAlchemist is Reddit's fan community for the series, full of every kind of content one could wish for. Fanart, discussion, crafting work, memes, videos, completely valid fantasies about Maes Hughes daddy fantasies, all kinds of things. Since the series ended back in 2010, there hasn't been much new content to discuss. Fortunately, a good series remains a good series, and rather than being spoiled by a bad ending or something, FMA is gold from start to finish, remaining a timeless masterpiece as worthy of discussion in 2021 as in 2010. Unless the aliens invade and we have our minds wiped of anime as a well-deserved punishment for, well, just in general, it'll probably still be discussed in 2040 in a similar light. History will probably forget Claymore, Deadman Wonderland, and Cop Craft, but if it ever forgets Fullmetal Alchemist, it'll take its sweet time doing so. Some classics, like Akira, are simply too good to go away forever.

So there's a lot to talk about. While some series is limited to merely the events and characters, FMA brings up a lot of interesting concepts that could be endlessly talked about. While you won't commonly find people discussing the nature of mortality or the function of God on /r/FullmetalAlchemist, knowing that they're topics that can reasonably be covered within the scope of just the series itself is nice. I don't need to make any logical stretches like when I try to butt in on people to tell them about how Spice and Wolf is really just slow-burn libertarian propaganda, or that Steins;Gate is just a Dr. Pepper advertisement directed by the ghost of Stanley Kubrick who ran wild with the project. With FMA, I can just write a long post detailing just how Mustang's tiny miniskirt edict will stimulate the post-war Amestrian economy, revealing his grand genius, and be in good company.

Oh, and to get it out of the way: Yes, both the 2003 series and Brotherhood are worth watching. They're awesome. One's better, but that's like saying that Jupiter's bigger than Saturn. They're both huge as fuck, so it's not knocking Saturn at all. Watch them both, and check out the FAQ on /r/FullmetalAlchemist to learn more about the topic. If you're an anime fan who hasn't seen them, then you've been missing out on a pretty big piece of the whole thing. There's no better time to fix that. Then, come back and tell us all about your favorite character, why it's Hawkeye, and we can get to talking about what really matters, which is whether milk really does make you taller or not.

It does. Ed needed a nutritionist to tell him that. Too much bread and meat, but at least he didn't have an iron deficiency!

Please laugh...

The Rising of the Shield Hero is one of my favorite anime series, but its first episode is what has stopped me from reading the light novel. The protagonist, Naofumi Iwatani, is the subject of such intense hatred from the world around him, which conspired to fuck him over as much and as hard as possible, that I think reading through it would actually give me a hate-induced aneurysm. One character, named ~~Bitch~~ Malty, is essentially the most unlikable person to have ever been unjustly spawned into creation by what could have only been a dark ritual called [Transmute Shit to Human].

Still, the series is phenomenal. Armed with a shield, distrust of everyone, and intelligence greater than a middle schooler, he outshines the other ""heroes"" left and right to make real headway on the world's problems without inconveniencing everyone he comes across. He saves people, shelters some innocents, and gathers loyal party members and friends Raphtalia and Filo to come along for the adventure. Shield Hero is practically therapy in motion without the suggestion of forgiving and forgetting. Most of us would have been a lot less merciful in Naofumi's shoes, which just goes to show that he really is a good guy.

Shield Hero is a series of light novels, manga, and anime, which originally came from a web novel but bears no canonical relation to it. While the web novel's ended, the light novel (which is what's been adapted to the anime and manga) has been said by the author to be essentially a different series altogether. The anime had its first season, with a second coming sometime this year, which I'm excited for. Maybe it'll make me actually read the light novels. Oh, you know by now I'm never going to have the energy to get off my ass (metaphorically) and read things. Not without snorting half a pound of mysterious powder, anyway.

Why's it called /r/ShieldBro you ask? Well, for one thing, Naofumi's a total bro. Other than that, I really couldn't tell you. There's another subreddit, /r/shieldhero, that is a tenth the size, but is otherwise about the same in terms of content. I guess it's personal preference. I use /r/shieldbro. Whatever wields your shield, or something like that.

Come by and prepare for the new season. I'm sure it will be fun and wholesome and nobody will get mad about it on social media this time. Maybe discuss how much you think it's bullshit that the Shield Hero crew got only a few minutes of real screentime in Isekai Quartet and voice your demand for full-length episodes from next season onward. It can't be just me, right?

*Kazuma, Kazuma!*

*Hai, Kazuma desu.*

Konosuba is short for Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku o, or ""God's Blessing on this Wonderful World"". It tells the story of a NEET, Satou Kazuma, who dies in the most pathetic way possible and is sent to a fantasy world to slay a demon king and free the people of the world. Unfortunately, Kazuma is a shut-in who doesn't care about any of that. Being either a giant asshole or a mega chad, depending on your perspective, he even forcibly takes a goddess in charge of Earth's reincarnations with him to suffer by his side as he makes no moves whatsoever toward accomplishing his objective.

Konosuba isn't a hero's story. It's not about conquering the evil demon king or anything. It's about a group of idiots who band together to be stupid together. Kazuma is a pervert with high luck and low everything else. Aqua is useless at everything but drinking and racking up debt. Megumin is a stick of dynamite that's just as useful as a one-use explosive and twice as embarrassing to be around. Darkness is a thing that gets off on being abused and should just date Kazuma, who's perfect for her awful criteria. These four characters go on adventures that mostly begin with them lying around doing nothing, being reminded that they owe people a lot of money, and then fucking up enough to pay off that debt and rack up a new one.

There's also Yunyun. I wouldn't normally mention a side character except that I proudly serve the Soviet Yunyun and consider her the best character in the series. I've never wanted to attend a birthday party as much as hers. She's too good for the world.

I've not started the light novels, sue me. The anime's great, as is the movie, and I'm sure the LNs are up to the same quality, but I'm already ignoring all kinds of other things in favor of rereading Overlord and staring blankly at a huge trove of entertainment and complaining about having nothing to watch or read. It's a busy life. You can be stronger than me, though. Do what I could not. This laziness has been passed down through the generations, waiting for a time when it could be overcome to read a book like a functioning adult. Next, it's your turn.

Anyway, come degenerate in good company. We've got art, we've got memes, we've got discussion, we've got more art. Don't pretend you're not a weeb who just wants to look at [Megumin suplexing Kazuma into the ground](https://www.reddit.com/r/Konosuba/comments/krza8c/how_to_solve_a_couples_argument/) or something.

**Spoiler Alert!** For those who have not seen The Promised Neverland's first season, go watch it. It's phenomenal. I'll wait.

Okay. In The Promised Neverland, a group of children discovers that their loving home is actually a farm created to raise human children to be eaten by demons. They begin to plan a way to escape before being shipped out. Things don't go as planned, but at the end of Season 1, they manage to get over the wall and into the forests below, which is where Season 2 begins.

Now, I've read the manga and side stories, and it's complete, so there's nothing to spoil for me, but I won't be talking about that. As Season 2 just began a few days ago, I'm assuming that you've watched season 1 and are just starting season 2 like most people.

/r/ThePromisedNeverland is an ascended form of anime subreddit, in that many of its members have seen the end of the story and are now reliving it through a different medium. It's already ended, and now a new generation of fans is coming to enjoy the same world. On the subreddit you'll have the wise manga-readers and eager anime-watchers together, and it's very nice. There's fanart and all the things you normally get from a series subreddit, too, of course. It's surprisingly wholesome for such a dark show.

Come join the fun as season 2 continues. Allow the glory that is Emma's endless optimism to distract you from the pain of not having Phil around. We could all use some Emma optimism right now.

Natsuki Subaru is a Japanese teenage NEET who gets transported from his world to a fantasy world by the powers of magic and a suspicious convenience store. Within the first episode, the title of the series is demonstrated in Subaru's unique power, which is that, when he dies, he returns to life from a save point in the recent past. Only he is aware of this occurring, and he cannot tell anyone about it. Additionally, he cannot control when his progress is saved, or know when he'll return to before he does. Subaru, using this power, sets out to suffer endlessly for the sake of those closest to him, engaging in the world's worst political process while dealing with monsters, cults, flying cats, demon twins, and the machinations of a rich and powerful clown. Last but not least, there's Otto. We like Otto.

Re:Zero recently started the second half of its second season. It's awesome. Go watch that if you haven't noticed the new episode already. I won't talk about it here, but you can talk all about it on /r/Re_Zero or the discussion thread on /r/Anime.

So, /r/Re_Zero. A large subreddit dedicated to the series made up primarily of great people who know much more about it than I do. Much like other series that I love, I lack the energy and attention span to have read the light novels. I started, then put it aside for something else. There's no end to the positive reviews for them, just as there's no end to the positive reviews of the show, and these folks know it. It's a healthy mixture of [awesome art](https://www.reddit.com/r/Re_Zero/comments/krqkfw/oc_as_i_promised_here_is_my_drawing_of_emilia/), discussion, creations, and questions. Since the series is on, you'll also be seeing comparisons between scenes in the show versus the light novel, wherein you'll probably be told to read the light novel a lot. I'd concur, but that'd make me a bit of a hypocrite, right? Still, though.

Come place your bets on who will come out on top this season, who will fall behind, and how Subaru will justify continuing to chase Emilia when his true love is right in front of his eyes? I mean, it's no contest. Otto's clearly superior. Check back next week for my thousand-page fanfic wherein Otto and Felix compete to... Y'know what, I'll leave that unsaid.

Oh, and be ready for some more anime subreddits. From the 7th to the 14th, we're going to be featuring a bunch of them. I guess you could call this Weeb Week, if you really wanted to.

Hunter X Hunter is a long-running manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi, the same mangaka who gave us Yu Yu Hakusho, that has been running in Weekly Shonen Jump since 1998. Weekly, huh. In reality, it's more like Once A Year Maybe Shonen Jump, but who's counting? Apparently Togashi makes the manga by himself, unlike others of his craft who have teams of people, so it only gets updated once per epoch. I'm not certain if that's true, but that's what I keep hearing, and since this is the internet, I'll assume it's correct.

The series focuses on Gon Freecss in his journey to become a great Hunter, which is a catch-all for people who spend their lives doing crazy stuff. They're paid exorbitant amounts of money and given incredible benefits for their ability to beat the crap out of people. In Hunter X Hunter's beatdown-based economy, Hunters travel the world (sort of) and do whatever they please, only needing to take occasional direction from the Hunter Association. Gon's dad is a famous Hunter, too, and also an absentee father who would rather spend his time tomb raiding like Lara Croft or developing GTA:VR to see his son. During this journey, Gon searches for his father, presumably to seek owed child support, and in the process meets a huge cast of interesting characters that, in shonen fashion, help him along the way.

As of right now, the series has 390 chapters, the last of which was released in 2018. Maybe Togashi is taking the extra time to flesh out the rules of Gungi and give us a playable game of it.

/r/HunterXHunter is, of course, the fan community for HXH on Reddit. Given that the time between chapters can be measured on the geological scale, the discussion:media ratio is definitely heavy in the latter's favor, with most of the subreddit being dedicated to fan art of some kind. Of course, the former is still around, such as the usual theories, questions, rewatch threads, and questioning whether it's okay that Pitou makes you feel funny in your tummy or not. There's also the usual confusion around how Nen works, which if you think you know, you don't. It's like the Stands in JoJo, just keep it moving and don't think too hard about it.

It should be said that Hunter X Hunter also has an anime. And a second anime. The first was made in 1999 by Nippon Animation, which gave us such hits as, uh...  Well, anyway, they also got a series in 2011, this time made by Madhouse, a powerhouse studio that gave us all kinds of great series, then yanked most of them away after one season despite their ability to print their own bags of money with every frame. There were also some films, but as I haven't seen them, I can't talk about them. Same goes for the OVAs, video games, musicals, and knowing how huge the series is, I imagine there are some Tiger electronic wristwatch games of it out there somewhere, too.

If you're a fan, have a look. If you're already a subscriber: Congrats to you, and I hope things stay great and another chapter comes out soon. If you're neither, go watch the 2011 anime for a solid introduction to the series, and I'll see you in a week or so when you've finished binging all 148 episodes. Should you like it, the manga's not going anywhere in a hurry, so you can get a *jump* on that, too. Be sure to fall in love with some characters and play ""Will They Ever Show Up Again"", my favorite game of determining who I won't get to see again until their next appearance twenty years after my death.

Well, I'll be waiting. Maybe when I'm senile, and I can experience it for the first time again through head-in-a-jar technology of the 30th century, it'll be finished, and I can finally be complete. Well, as complete as a severed head can be.

**260,005 readers** for **5 years!**

Okay, [othergender] can come too. Here at Subreddit of the Day, we don't care what, if any, gender you are. All meat is the same to our alien overlords.

Not everyone is as enlightened as we servants of the space hamster empire, though, as /r/pointlesslygendered shows. The subreddit is a place to post products and things that have no purpose in being gendered, but are. For instance, my body wash, which I bought because it was on sale and I'm cheap, which is FOR MEN, MEN ONLY, WOMEN USING IT WILL IMMEDIATELY GET BEARDS AND DEPRESSION. Books for women, weights for men, alcohol that cares what you have in your pants. There's nothing stopping anyone from using it, but some marketer in a corporate office thought it would increase sales some percent in a certain demographic if certain focus group-approved words and colors were used, so here we are.

Of course, there are other examples, such as when people proclaim that certain things are for men or women alone, like [how only women can have cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/pointlesslygendered/comments/konys5/because_owning_a_cat_somehow_makes_you_a_woman/). In essence, the subreddit is a mockery of stupid opinions born of people who place way too much emphasis on genitalia in things that genitalia has no bearing on. I'd make a joke here about what products could reasonably be gendered, but I'm just going to piss someone off if I try, so I'll restrain myself.

Give it a look and let me know whether ""sport"" is a valid fragrance, because I have no clue what the hell it's supposed to smell like.

**281,179** *1400-rated Grandmasters* for **12 years**!

&nbsp;

2020 was a wild year for chess, to say the least. First, it absolutely exploded on Twitch. Then it absolutely exploded on Twitch a second time. Then Netflix dropped their hit show ""The Queen's Gambit"", a chess drama in which the main character is a Sicilian Defence player and not a Queen's Gambit player. As I type this, the 2 main online chess sites, Chess.com and Lichess.org, are reporting 206,000 & 26,000 concurrent players respectively, which is just an absurd number of people. The popularity of chess always seems to wax and wane over time: it boomed in popularity in the nineties with the chess computer Deep Blue beating the world champion at the time; it had a boom in the late 60's and 70's with Bobby Fischer just destroying every opponent he came up against.

As a game, Chess is perhaps one of, if not the greatest ever created. It's complex enough that it can be enjoyed by beginners playing casual games, as well as at the highest level, that requires unimaginable amount of study and practice. You don't need to be a master to play a good game, you just have to remember how the horsey moves and you're set.

I've been playing chess all my life, but only got any good at it about 2 years ago or so. I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL4HDCQjhHQ) video of the legend himself, Eric Rosen, being some random Norwegian guy at a game of chess, and it enlightened me to the amount of stuff I didn't know about the game. Like, who knew that thinking about what a move does will actually, like, make you play better? That realisation led me to want to learn more. Now reading is for nerds and dorks, so I neglected to buy/""""""buy"""""" a textbook, instead finding my way to /r/Chess.

/r/Chess is a sub about everything chess (well, almost everything, memes go to /r/anarchychess). Chess news, learning resources, fun tactical exercises, game analyses. It's filled with people who know way more about the game that you or I probably do, and the wealth of knowledge there is enough to aid in any new player's journey into the wonderful world of high level chess. With an extremely knowledgeable and helpful community, it's the best place on Reddit for all chess players, newcomers and masters alike!


&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/2015_BCS_ORANGE_BOWL** There was a massive amount of drama that resulted in the top moderator stepping down, which I'm sure you can find recapped on SRD. The former second moderator (MrLegilimens) decided to hold mod elections for all the slots, including his own seat. I had been posting here for a long time so I stood in the moderator elections.

>> **/u/city-of-stars** I started participating in /r/chess several years ago, specifically during our coverage of the Anand-Carlsen World Championship match in 2014. Back then the subreddit was much more bare-bones than it is today; I started designing rudimentary banner graphics to highlight different events as the popularity of the subreddit increased. During the summer, a conflict of interest was exposed within the moderator team that led to an explosion of drama; ultimately, the head moderator stepped down and new elections were held. I threw my hat into the ring and ended up getting elected as part of a new eight-member team.


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/2015_BCS_ORANGE_BOWL** I just participate in the subreddit like I always have, but now I also remove off-topic posts and offensive comments while I see them. Chess is an international game, so there are some common geopolitical slapfights that crop up. For example, there are a lot of top players from Armenia, and a lot from Azerbaijan. Iran doesn't let their players play Israelis. So both of those conflicts are sometimes litigated on /r/chess. Other than that, it's just the usual cracking down on trolls and spammers.

>> **/u/city-of-stars** A lot of the work is janitorial drudgery - removing memes, low-effort content, off-topic political squabbles and the like. With the sudden uptick in new users we've made efforts to become more active as a moderator team, including implementing a major CSS overhaul, an expanded wiki for beginners and increased promotion of top-level tournaments. But beyond that, I contribute to the community just like I used to do.

> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/u/2015_BCS_ORANGE_BOWL** I like to give advice, so I like participating in any threads where players are asking for advice. Tournament live threads are also fun.

>> **/u/city-of-stars** The [""Best of /r/chess""](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/faq#wiki_best_of_.2Fr.2Fchess) section in the FAQ contains many of my favourite posts from the subreddit's history. Feel free to check it out!



> **4: What advice do you have for new/newer players who wish to get more involved with chess?**

>> **/u/2015_BCS_ORANGE_BOWL** I strongly recommend that they get involved in some kind of chess community. Ideally an over-the-board club, but these days more likely a discord server or a subreddit. Chess can be a very lonely activity if you don't have chess friends. Chess clubs get beginners all the time, so don't feel like you have to improve before you visit one. People are almost always happy to teach new players.

>> **/u/city-of-stars** Dive right in! Don't be afraid to lose, especially as a beginner. Try to play with a community, whether it's a group of friends at your local chess club, or online. Learn algebraic notation and make a habit of writing down the moves from all your games; it might seem like tedious busywork at first, but those notes will come in handy when you're reviewing your games for mistakes afterwards. Also, resist the temptation to immediately throw your moves into an engine - try and work out the moves and lines for yourself. Chess puzzles are great for developing this sort of tactical aptitude; you can find many chess puzzles on places like Chess.com, Chesstempo, and Lichess.

> **5: Chess has seen a substantial boom in popularity in recent weeks and months, and has certainly been thrust into the limelight. Where do you see it going from here?**

>> **/u/2015_BCS_ORANGE_BOWL** Chess often goes through periods of sudden popularity- the Fischer boom in the 70s, the twitch boom over the last summer, the new players from the Queen's Gambit show. It's always good to get more new players. But because of the staying power of chess- it has been played at a high level since the early 1800s- I don't worry too much about the fluctuations. I have no doubt that chess will not be nearly as popular on twitch.tv in one year, as streamers move on to new games. I also have no doubt that chess will still be played in 100 years. High level online rapid tournaments are a new development, and they are here to stay, but classical OTB chess isn't going anywhere either.

>> **/u/city-of-stars** The COVID pandemic, the rise of popularity of Twitch, and the massive success of the Netflix TV series The Queen's Gambit have all brought new people to the game. But this is nothing new - chess has always seen waves of global popularity. Bobby Fischer's reign as world champion in the 1970s led to an explosion of chess popularity in America, and Viswanathan Anand's reign thirty years later did the same for India. Chess was once strictly a royal pasttime of shahs and rajahs in medieval India and Persia, and even through the 1800s was primarily played as an amusement for rich men in coffeehouses scattered across Europe. So it's very heartening to see more and more people of different backgrounds picking up the game! /r/chess always welcomes beginners, and our sister subreddit /r/chessbeginners serves as a forum for those wishing to ask questions and pick up the basics of the game.

> **6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/2015_BCS_ORANGE_BOWL** There are definitely some projects I want to work on when I have more time. I would like to expand the FAQ to cover more of the most frequently reposted beginner questions. We also want to add a system to verify people's titles that they've earned in OTB play. Having a master title carries a lot of respect in the chess world, and traditionally they would get a little (GM) or (NM) next to their name. Right now anyone can put (GM) in their flair, but we'd like to have a special flair for people who can verify their title.

>> **/u/city-of-stars** We're hoping to legitimize /r/chess as a major online platform for discussing, learning about, and following chess. To this end, we've been working on a major overhaul of our subreddit's appearance over the last few months and establishing a consistent tournament promotion schedule. While we are not formally affiliated with any of the major online chess platforms, we do hope to expand our event coverage and establish more of an online presence as a community on places like Twitter, although those are long-term goals and might necessitate expanding the moderator team.

> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/2015_BCS_ORANGE_BOWL** I made a couple of posts on /r/hobbydrama about some drama that happened in the chess community in the past. People might find those interesting to read even if they don't play chess.

>> https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/iylibo/chess_that_time_a_chessplayer_was_accused_of/

>> https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/f9uv4d/chess_sponsor_of_major_online_chess_events_turns/

>> **/u/city-of-stars** ""The Game of Kings"", as chess has traditionally been known as, can be a rigorous and demanding sport. But it's also loads of fun, and after a while, strangely addictive! We welcome players of all skill levels at /r/chess, and we hope you guys find our community engaging and enjoyable. For those of you interested in memes/chess humour, we encourage you to check out our sister subreddit /r/AnarchyChess, a community as chaotic as the name implies :-) Good luck!

All of us weebs have got *that* anime. The one that, if given the chance, we will talk about for hours. We'll make videos explaining why our favorite characters are so great. We'll shout down the naysayers who call it overrated and proclaim its virtues. It's the series we'll watch a hundred times, never getting tired of its jokes, never not getting hyped at its action scenes, and always feeling the same melancholy when it ends.

For me, Kill La Kill *isn't* that series, but I'm being bullied by my friend who fits that bill into writing this. Don't get me wrong: I love Kill La Kill. It's easily in my top five series, but I didn't get pulled in to the same degree as someone I know, who cosplays as [Kiryuuin Satsuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16q43J-dBFg) and once made some delicious Senketsu cookies. Initially, it was a 9/10 series for me, already a masterpiece above even Gurren Lagann (don't @ me if you think that's low) by the same studio, but after hearing her talk about it like I mentioned above, I've come around to understanding its more subtle qualities and the genius of its plot. It's not just another ""lol then there were aliens"" Studio Trigger story. It's solid from beginning to end, telling a singular story that goes beyond what I initially saw it as. Unlike Gurren Lagann, which amazes through visual spectacle, Kill La Kill amazes through masterpiece writing, follows it with incredible character development, and drives it all home with one of the best soundtracks in anime. [If you can listen to Blumenkranz without getting hyped you're not human.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBrNL5peDpA)

Normally, this is where I'd explain the story, but I just can't. I can't do it. You need to watch it to understand it, though it's Trigger, so you'll probably need to read the explanations of someone anyway, just someone smarter than I am. Certified cool gal beats up students with the power of blood magic. There, that's my essay. It has the distinction of having the most powerful Student Council in anime, a teacher who exposes himself to children (but it's cool, I swear), magic clothes, naked paramilitary, and Mako. I like Mako.

/r/KillLaKill is Reddit's fan community for the show, of course. They're fellows who recognize the glory of the series for what it is. Like most anime communities on Reddit, it's primarily memes and fan art with a helping of discussion and questions, so it's definitely geared more toward those who have seen the series than those just starting out. That's fine; it's only 24 episodes, plus an OVA episode, so it's not like it's long or hard to get into. Watch the series, then check in after the final episodes wreck your emotions. Again, if you aren't affected by the finale or OVA, you're not human.

Watch it. That's all that there is to say.

Then, when you're done, come and check out /r/KillLaKill and enjoy the great fan art, strange memes that now make sense, and [whatever this is](https://www.reddit.com/r/KillLaKill/comments/k85l4j/ryuko_pain/). Zoomer humor, I guess. Kids these days, I swear. Apparently Ryuko's been widespread for a meme lately, but these kids and their humor just doesn't reach me in my ancient crypt. There's hardly any wifi down here to begin with. Anyway, whatever your introduction to the series, I'm just glad you're giving it a shot.

There. The contract is fulfilled. I wrote the thing. Quit bullying me.

Happy new year! ***[here's the survey mentioned in the title](https://forms.gle/aukFbV7ZsFXMJiBW7)***, just for those of you who wouldn't make it to the bottom of the post.

Well, 2020 was... Yeah. It doesn't need to be said.

[Here is a scientific graph of SrotD's year](https://i.imgur.com/mS4YwSx.png) (peer reviewed objective fact btw), and as you can see, it's been a difficult year for us here as well. We had a decent start from where we were at during the end of 2019, but then it all went to h*ck when Covid hit, as did everything. However, despite the hardships, we've had a pretty brilliant December, if I do say so myself, in no small part due to the lovely writers /u/Verifypassword__ and /u/Xaviermendel.

But enough doom and gloom ~~though what else is there to talk about in this burning trash heap of a year~~, on top of all of it we've done some pretty cool things this year:

##700,000 Subscribers!

Awesome! Thanks to all the people who make this thing possible. 700,000 people is *huge!*

##800,000 subscri-

Okay okay [this is the same joke I did last year](http://reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/eim6sk/january_1st_2020_rsubredditoftheday_the_annual/), let's just jump to the big one:

##**1 Million Subscribers!!!**

In September of this year, we hit the big one million. It was [6 long years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/2ga2fe/congratulations_in_honor_of_our_100000th/) that we hit the 100k mark, and in 2020 alone we've managed to go from 700k to 1.1 million. Which is just, like, completely insane! Thank you all so much. We're so glad that there are so many people who want to tune in to our little sub, and we hope that we can continue to provide you with interesting subreddits. As we approach the 10 year anniversary of [the first ever SRotD feature](https://redd.it/h14er)(!!!!!), we'll continue to try and Bring the Awesome to you, with cool subs you might never have heard of. There's never a shortage of cool subs out there, and it will be many more moons before we exhaust the good ones.

&nbsp;

##2020 in review

With all that being said, despite the difficulties we've faced as a sub, we've still managed to feature some awesome subs over the year. We also featured some less than awesome ones, can't all be winners I guess. Here's a look at some of those.

##The top features of 2020

**1:** [*October 7th, 2020 - /r/OnlyFans: Take a seat and enjoy the breeze!*](https://redd.it/j6pj26) - You dirty fucks. Written by guest writer /u/EnderbroSonny.

**2:** [*March 13th, 2020 - /r/IsTodayFridaythe13th: Yes.*](https://redd.it/fhyj4w) - Honestly with how terrible this year has been I'm suprised /u/GangControl gave us a Friday the 13th at all. Written by /u/Conalfisher, that guy's an asshole, he removed my post in /r/unpopularopinion.

**3:** [*July 9th, 2020- /r/weeklydictator: A subreddit where anyone can become its dictator*](https://redd.it/ho1ujm) - It's nice when a new sub comes along with a genuinely good new idea, This sub is a fun concept, and I implore you to check it out. Written by guest writer /u/LordDucktilious.

**4:** [*July 18th, 2020 - /r/dragonsfuckingcars: [NSFW] fine draconian and automotive ""modern art""*](https://redd.it/htfh39) - You sicken me. All of you. Written by /u/verifypassword__, whom I have reported to my local priest.

**5:** [*October 8th, 2020 - /r/AnarchyChess: Sac and attack until you win!*](https://redd.it/j7f36p) - Chess really took off this year, and with its collision with the outside world came a huge influx of memeing. I daresay this is my favourite meme sub on the site. Written by /u/Conalfisher, he's a dickhead, he plays the London System.

So those were the ones that everyone liked. [Let's look at the ones that weren't quite universally well received:](https://gfycat.com/snivelingoccasionalannelid)


## The most controversial features of 2020

**1:** [*January 31st, 2020 - /r/BabyYoda: This Is The Way*](https://redd.it/ewov3h) - I love it when two internet circlejerks collide, and the baby yoda circlejerk colliding with the baby yoda hate circlejerk was a delight to see. Submitted by guest writer /u/MajorParadox.

**2:** [*October 16th, 2020 - /r/AwpPorn: Sexy Awps*](https://redd.it/jcslus) - There comes a day in every SRotD mod's where they find themselves staring at an empty calendar, no feature scheduled for the day, no time to write one, and certainly no time to message a subreddit for permission to feature them; and in those desperate times, the only hope is to just feature another sub that you mod. We're not all powermods just here at SRotD ~~(just me)~~, so sometimes we just have to work with what we have. And here it was a sub with 4 posts and 19 subscribers. Written by /u/HoldmyAwp.

**3:** [*December 24th, 2020 - /r/AOC: Reddit's home for fans of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.*](https://redd.it/kjf2db) - There were few political features made this year, but this was an enjoyable one to be sure. Don't worry, there'll be some more buttery US election drama next month, as an /r/SubredditDrama mod it's my duty to deliver. Written by our very own /u/XavierMendel.

**4:** [*January 26th, 2020 - /r/VerifiedFeet: [NSFW] 100% OC pics of feet*](https://redd.it/eu88hm) - Right under /r/AOC. There's a Ben Shapiro joke in here somewhere. Written by /u/verifypassword__, I think we're slowly but surely discovering all of his kinks here.

**5:** [*July 21st, 2020 - /r/SeriesXbox: Everything next-gen Xbox!*](https://redd.it/hv6477) - Well according to the comments, this was just a terrible sub to feature, something about constantly spamming. Honestly I'm unsure how I missed all that, cause I distinctly remembering them PMing me asking me to join the sub once (before the feature), which is already suspicious as shit. Yeah, but the sub's closed down now, so there's that.


And to wrap up this year's annual recap:

##[A survey!](https://forms.gle/aukFbV7ZsFXMJiBW7)

**[Here's a link to the survey!](https://forms.gle/aukFbV7ZsFXMJiBW7)** We do these survey every now and then, to find out more about our audience, as well as how we can improve the subreddit and make it more enjoyable for everyone. It only takes 5 minutes to fill out, so if you have the time, please give us your feedback!

&nbsp;

Thanks to all of you who've reached the end of this annual recap. And thanks to you all for sticking around out little community! We here at SRotD wish you all a wonderful 2021!

&nbsp;

This feature marks the longest one I've ever undertaken because in order to do it I had to go and beat an entire JRPG, and it wasn't a short one. Not even the ones from my childhood, which could be done in a day or two, but a Playstation JRPG on multiple discs. It should be noted that I am atrocious at these kinds of games since I am one of the most impatient people to have ever been born, and that, up to my own devices, I would have quit before Chapter 2. So why'd I stick around?

Well, let me tell you.

Legend of Dragoon (or *The* Legend of Dragoon, but I've never said the ""The"") is an RPG made by SCE Japan and released for the Playstation in 1999. The gameplay will be familiar to you if you've ever played just about any JRPG on the PS1, though it's got its differences, like the odd button mash or two. It's fun, but it's not enough to keep me going and confront the trauma of my old memory card eating my LoD save file (twice), which is the issue that made me give up plenty of games.

Well, it could be the story, right? The story's great, though difficult to summarize due to the intricate nature of everything being explained with another thing that requires an explanation. Put simply as possible: You play as Dart, a spiky-haired hero type who is trying to save his friend, and later the world, from a cast of antagonists, starting with a kidnapping and ending in an epic confrontation of good and evil, which is always nice. I like the story, the characters, and the setting, the latter enough that I'd kill for a second game exploring more of it, but that alone didn't overpower my natural urge to abandon everything out of impatience and laziness. Before you ask: No, it's not the music, either, though it's pretty sweet, so I thought I'd mention it. It's not the graphics, either, though again, they're good for the PS1, and I find them about on par with FFVIII.

What kept me going was mostly /u/DrewUniverse. See, I like seeing passionate moderators, community members, and that sort, and Drew is the type of person I just love to see. They help run the subreddit, discord server, and even [LegendOfDragoon.org](https://legendofdragoon.org), a dedicated fansite for the game that gathers an otherwise disconnected community together. For the past year, Drew has been championing a [petition on the website directed toward Sony Interactive Entertainment](https://legendofdragoon.org/petition/), the rights holders of Legend of Dragoon, intent on remaking the game for the modern day and bringing a great game to greater masses. I urge you to take a look and, if you're interested, sign it and help reach its next milestone.

Back in April, I told Drew that I'd try my best on this. They're a good person, so I'm going to follow through. Let's do this.

The nature of the Legend of Dragoon community is the sort that is enviable to all but the most massive and widely-appealing game communities in that, even with 21 years since the last release, its forums are active and its fans are still hungry for more. They still discuss characters, make fan art, remix songs, write guides, and one fan, /u/AdrianRoszak, is making an entire manga series out of it, the first post of which [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legendofdragoon/comments/ishsid/the_legend_of_dragoon_manga_project_scroll_1/). This is the essence of what I love most about doing this whole thing, and is what made me want to write for Subreddit of the Day in the first place. Small, dedicated communities held together by good people with a firm and unyielding love for what brought them together. /r/LegendOfDragoon exemplifies that better than most.

One major part of the community that I'd hate to forget to mention is the [discord server, which you can find at this link](https://discord.gg/rQWXgK5). It's got hundreds of active members and is set up as a live hub for modding, streaming, and everything else they're up to. For dumb people like me it's also an excellent resource to search when you have problems with or in the game, since somebody's probably asked before and five people have provided great answers already. This is especially helpful when you're emulating the game, maybe because you've bought at least four PS1s in your lifetime, and they've all been stolen or broken, and you're not buying another, and your old PS2 is broken from when your friend accidentally kicked it into a wall, and the replacement you got was stolen, and... Well, I mean, anything could happen, y'know?

When it first came out in North America, it did so at a bad time. For those of you who don't remember, the year 2000 had some juggernaut releases, and June of that year was insane. For RPG fans, Deus Ex and Diablo II both came out on PC within about a week of each other. Realistically, the only people who bought it were gamers who primarily played on the PS1 and could take a chance on a lengthy RPG not tied to an existing brand. I bought it a bit later at a Christmas sale of the same year at the same time that I bought Final Fantasy IX, and that's where fate came in. My memory card ate Legend of Dragoon's save file twice in a row, so I abandoned it to try Final Fantasy IX when I got a new card and never really went back to finish it. Well, until now.

Should you play it? Absolutely. It's one of the best RPGs ever made. It's great enough that, even with an impatience so great that I wish I didn't have to wait for light to hit my eyes so that I can see things, I can still call it a fantastic experience worthy of its stellar reviews. I liked what I'd seen twenty years ago, and I still like it now. Among the many JRPGs I've played, some of which were slogs and others which were unforgettable experiences, LoD earns its place near the top of the list.

But that's not why I'm recommending this to you. I'm recommending this to you because we're a celebration of interesting and awesome communities, and /r/LegendOfDragoon is as interesting and awesome as it gets. It is the epitome of a diehard fanbase; in fact, it's a die-never fanbase. On this day, I want you to check that out, give Drew's words a read, and if you're interested, pick up the game and give it a go. I won't be able to tell you here how to play it like I did due to potential Reddit stickiness with emulation, but you can play it the best way by picking up a copy on ebay for about $10-$20. More than worth the price.

Now, to talk more about /r/LegendOfDragoon and lay it on some more, here's /u/DrewUniverse answering a few questions for us.

>###1. First off, tell me a bit about yourself. How did you discover Legend of Dragoon, and how did you get involved with the community?

>**/u/DrewUniverse:** I am a researcher, archivist, and an advocate for improving the health of the gaming industry. I found Legend of Dragoon by accident at a department store, when I was browsing for demos to play. I first got involved around 2000 at the GameWinners forum as a little kid, then in 2007 with a fanbase rally via Youtube. Ultimately I wasn't ready until five years ago when I got a temporary job as a community manager. Since then it's been about project management, community service, and the intersection of those type of things.

>###2. We've all got a game that means the most to us. What makes Legend of Dragoon that game to you? What about it sets it apart from the rest?

>**/u/DrewUniverse:** It was the combination of being an impressionable child at the time coupled with LoD's story development, interactive combat, sounds, visuals, et cetera. I wasn't a ""Dragon buff"" to my knowledge, but the flying organic armor was already a step above Beetleborgs and I enjoyed that pretty well. 

> The soundtrack stood out because, unlike most games, this OST didn't try to have all its tracks sound like they all belonged together. This was a diverse set of tracks meant to seem ""worldly."" And, while the game has its fair share of derivative design, it also had a lot of original ones. Particularly the Dragons. I am *all* about those Dragons. We learned some cool stuff about them in the last few years too. ;)

>###3. How about the community? Dedicated communities like this are full of gems. What makes the LoD community great? What are some of your favorite things they've done or created?

>**/u/DrewUniverse:** The most noteworthy aspect to mention is the unending passion of the fanbase. The nostalgia overload is quite strong, and hard to subdue. That is saying a lot for a linear, single-player RPG that had no updates since release. We share many overlaps with other fandoms, such as fanart/fic/music and ongoing discussions/questions/media shares. 

> Personal memories include the day I got in contact with Wally Fields, a voice artist for one of the cinematics. He did Dr. Muto! Also, when I started our petition for a remake, the surviving composer Dennis Martin did a write up honoring the game and his involvement, sharing never before seen sheet music. Official sheet music! We were blown away, considering most of the dev team disappeared shortly after release. 

> We've had a significant amount of help from fellow fans in regards to modding, translation, archives, and wiki updates. Together we've found quite a bit of previously-unearthed information and content, both on the game discs and externally on the 'net. 

>###4. The petition to remake Legend of Dragoon has gained over 25,000 signatures so far. On top of signing, what more can people do to get Sony to take notice?

>**/u/DrewUniverse:** It's tough to untrain ourselves from thinking that all we have to do is clamor loudly, but we have to change gears if we expect a positive result. Channel your passion and work with the global community. Unity, numbers, and presentation are key. Also, think internationally. There are fans all around the world who have been signing, and it's past time that we support them in their native languages when possible.

> We also have to factor in the state of the gaming industry and how, unfortunately, dozens upon dozens of layers require careful navigation. It's a lot, and many fans are casual, so it's an incredibly fine balance to maintain. Everyone has to choose to work together, and despite needing to be comprehensive we can't afford to make the campaign too laborious or complicated. It's a constant learning process.

>###5. Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions. Is there anything else you would like to say?

>**/u/DrewUniverse:** Quite welcome, and thank you for having me. To anyone interested in this game, please bookmark and visit [our global fansite](https://legendofdragoon.org). It's a hub of the most comprehensive and accurate information available on Legend of Dragoon, from game data to developer extras to community news. 

> If I could say one thing that puts all this into perspective, it's the testament of the game's enjoyment despite its age. I implore anyone reading this, to recognize that a game isn't better just because it's hot and new. You don't have to see old games as something you just replay or reminisce about. You can have a community for that game today if it has at least half a dozen fans.

> If you are curious to learn more about me or what I've said today, bookmark my [personal website](https://drewuniverse.net/). I tend to blog about the gaming industry, society, and other musings. I'm also pretty fabulous and I bake stellar brownies.

Thank you again to /u/DrewUniverse for answering our questions, their awesome work in this community, and for serving as a standard bearer of the greatness of dedicated fanbases and what they can be. Thank you to the Legend of Dragoon community, both on and off Reddit, for giving me so much awesome to work with.

With a TV Movie, 861 episodes of the show, and over 57 years of the Whoniverse (comics, animation, choose-your-own-adventure books, novels, audio dramas, unlimited rice pudding, etc.), Doctor Who is a show full of subject matter for exploration. /r/DoctorWho is the home to discussion, original artwork, cosplay, reviews, and more about *the Greatest Show in the Galaxy!* 
  
While the series is airing, there are weekly live threads while the episode is airing, post threads discussing the episode shortly after it airs, and speculation threads about the next week's episode (the threads for the last aired series is in the sidebar). Great things I've discovered through being subscribed to /r/DoctorWho include the video [*Every Doctor Who Story 1963-2018 - by BabelColour*](https://youtu.be/czwblMrYWhs) and [this almost comically detailed look at the Time Lords of Gallifrey](http://meshyfish.com/~roo/index.html).

The Silmarillion is a book by J.R.R. Tolkien and edited together by his son, Christopher Tolkien. It is a companion to the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit books, predating the publishing of the many that followed from Tolkien's unpublished works. It tells of the founding of Eä in the will of Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Ilúvatar. Expanding upon The Lord of the Rings like the Bible expanded upon Veggietales, it is essentially a book about how the elves fucked everything up, and teaches you lessons like ""don't piss off Tulkas"", ""a king who doesn't listen to his queen will inevitably die or fuck everything up"", and ""it doesn't matter how big of a dragon you are against Popeye the Sailor Elf.""

I am a Tolkien fan. Lifelong, and of this book, the other Great Tales, HoME, and so on and so forth. Tolkien's Legendarium is my crack, and this is a crack home. So I love /r/lotrmemes, of course, and that's been [featured before](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/a3nof6/december_6th_2018_rlotrmemes_lord_of_the_rings/), but for those of us who want to pretend we're superior because we read the more difficult, unadapted book, there's /r/Silmarillionmemes.

Where else can you refer to Fëanor, mighty a fey king as he, a simp lord? Where else can you discuss who suffered the most between Túrin, Neithan, Gorthol, and Agarwaen? Who else will understand my ceaseless turgidity toward Fingolfin?

Come browse some memes, elf-friend. Let us come together and discuss why being an elf isn't all it's cracked up to be, complain about Manwë, and laugh as we once again make fun of people who think Fëanor did nothing wrong.

Four months and over 300k subscribers? Damn, son.

/r/GoodAnimemes is an example of a subreddit created in competition to its original community. As Reddit's stance in moderation-related issues is generally ""fuck off and make your own subreddit"", they did just that, splitting themselves off and making a community without the moderators that the community couldn't otherwise divorce themselves from. This sort of thing happens very rarely due to the difficulty in creating a subreddit to compete with an already popular one, which leads to the advice of ""just make your own"" being taken in much the same way as being depressed and getting told to ""just cheer up"". The current popularity of the subreddit, out-performing its dramatic period of creation, is a testament to the community's resolve and success. I like seeing this sort of thing, so I thought I'd point it out.

So, in two words, who uses /r/GoodAnimemes? Fucking weebs. Anime fans who sit at their computers watching the latest isekai trash and choosing waifus based on such shallow metrics as making them feel good inside or having a wholesome personality. I mean, who's attracted to that stuff, anyway? It's better to choose based on floor tile quality and Guitar Hero high score. What can you expect? I mean, I'm a weeb, but there are some degenerates around here who cover their homes in body pillows to ward off predators and spend grandma's life savings on overpriced figurines. I'm not that far gone. The only thing I collect are packages of gummy Astolfo snacks. Don't inquire further as to their usage.

In a nutshell, it's a meme subreddit whose focus is on anime, manga, and similar mediums and the culture in general. From the mega weebs who read light novels and cosplay as their favorite characters to the burgeoning weeblets who recognize Vegetable and Krillex from Dragon Ball Z, there's something for everyone. Be warned, though, it does have some NSFW memes, so either be careful when browsing in public or get naked and look at hentai memes on the bus to assert your dominance. Either way is fine.

Of course, being that it's December, it's also a home to Padoru memes. I'm going to keep it real with you, I don't know, off the top of my head, what it's referencing. I'm pretty sure it's the Fate series, but I don't watch that shit. Maybe I *would* if I could figure out how, but its watch order is more complex than a goddamn traveling salesman problem done on paper. All I know of Fate is that all your historical figures are waifus and somebody named Astolfo is there to steal my heart from Nagisa, Felix, and Luka. Sounds dangerous.

Personally, I like most of the anime community. I love the memes, the overenthusiastic behavior, and the living tropes done for comedic effect. For instance, my above hyper-focusing on a very particular type of character, which is a common theme among fans of supreme culture. What is culture? Gun to my head, I couldn't give you a definition, but I know it when I see it. Don't think about it too hard. The whole place is a collage of behaviors and memes that don't just make you laugh from the mouth, but from the heart, the soul, and the prostate. It's an accepting community of all kinds, including newcomers, so you'll fit right in.

So give it a look and see what you think. If you're an anime fan, it'll probably be up your alley.

**96,123 readers** for **12 years!**

We don't often feature location subreddits here on Subreddit of the Day. Only so many people live in and around Pittsburgh, so for the rest of you, there's not much to talk about, right? So why am I featuring it?

Well, because I'm from Pittsburgh and because I get to write the feature.

No, this whole thing won't be yinz jokes and telling you where you should go to get the best sandwiches. I'm not going to make you give your opinion on Utz vs Lays or pretend I know what the hip young city kids are doing nowadays. There are two reasons for this:

1. Because that's lame, bro.

2. Because for the moment I'm not in the city, so if my favorite sandwich place burned down last week and I recommend it I'm gonna look like a fool.

Yeah, much like many Americans in need, I moved out of town in search of cheap medical care. Pittsburgh is, of course, in America, so there are issues. It's also in Pennsylvania, the Keystone State, which is famous for having only a few cities of territory, with the rest having been ceded to Kentucky. Much as I love the area I grew up in, we have to acknowledge some amazing faults it's got. 

Anyway, it's a lively city full of lively people and [gorgeous](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/k3mj59/it_was_gorgeous_today/) [views](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/k3q4et/nighttime_panorama_from_grandview_ave/). There are always things to do, and one of the things the subreddit's good at is finding those things. How would you know about the octoannual tri-county extreme bird wrestling and yoga grilling seminar convention? /r/Pittsburgh, that's how.

Y'know how I decided to feature this? I'd suddenly wanted a particular sandwich with coleslaw and remembered how far I am from Primanti Bros. I miss a lot of things about my hometown, but my weekly ritual of getting one of a few kinds of sandwiches from there to eat for lunch has left a hole in my heart that cannot be filled even by the resulting cholesterol. I've heard some die-harders call it ""touristy"", but man, the sandwich speaks for itself.

Right now, as I'm re-reading this feature for editing purposes, I'm also missing the snow. Crazy year to say that, but it's true. There's something about going a whole winter without shoveling the sidewalk that I just don't like. I hear it's getting buried there lately. Is it weird that I'm a little jealous? [Just look at this picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/kgg4ky/in_light_of_the_unfortunate_departure_of/) from /u/requires_reassembly of part of the city, or [this one of an adorable dog in the snow](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/kg8jyz/pupper_and_i_needed_to_walk_up_the_hill_and_see/) by /u/AffenTittenGeil. How can anyone not find that beautiful? [I'd go so far as to call this one art](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/kginqb/omnious_snowy_morning_in_the_burgh_seen_from/), by /u/Zrimmyjr.

Anyway, this one's for you, Pittsburgh. Party some more for me. Social distance-style, y'know.

Did you know that /r/ArmoredWomen was featured once before? [On September 12th, 2016, as a matter of fact.](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/52egeh/september_12th_2016_rarmoredwomen_no_boob_plates/) Go read that and take special care to read the interview with the head moderator, /u/StrangeGibberish.

Now, you're all aware of why this subreddit exists. Art of all kinds is filled with armor that makes [no goddamn sense](https://i.redd.it/2djesleusz161.png) at all. Oftentimes the armor is [completely pointless](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/032/279/036/4k/igor-scherba-.jpg), and although the quality of the pieces can be [beautiful to look at](https://i.redd.it/7zlxjlzjhz061.jpg), it's distracting when you see someone go to battle in the kind of attire you'd buy from a lingerie store. All these examples were pulled from /r/ImpracticalArmour, the other side of the coin to this subreddit, so give that a perusal as well when you can.

It's generally women who get the impractical armor treatment. Men get it too, but not to the same degree. Thus, /r/ArmoredWomen was set up to showcase women in actual, practical armor. Stuff that won't get you killed by any glancing blow or errant arrow, both of which have been occasionally known to happen on battlefields. Plate armor is the most common, but leather armor and even cloth armor can be reasonable as well. Of course, the subreddit is about reasonability and a lack of sexualization, so things like magic or future technology can still be in play, they just can't be unreasonable or sexualized. Personally, I'm less of a reasonability purist than some on the subreddit, but that's just a matter of opinion.

Now, I'm not the best person to talk about sexualization, being an asexual, or the best to talk about women in art, being neither a woman nor an art. [This is the epitome of my desire right here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFNFxYxol2g) However, I do know a little about art and armor, if only by nature of viewing a lot of it and collecting good art for so many years to assist with D&D and fantasy writing. I see a lot of the impractical pieces, and filtering through all of them to get to the good stuff, where the good stuff is appropriately layered beneath steel and leather, is a difficult endeavor. Still, it's worth it, even if it means you no longer get the discount for buying impractical armor that requires one-fifth of the material.

Come to /r/ArmoredWomen. We've got women in armor. Good armor, good art, and good people to discuss the good armor and good art with. All without [whatever the hell this is](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/031/888/202/4k/ren-wei-pan-peanut3.jpg) to clutter things up. Seriously, what the hell is that?

It's been a tough year for us all. From COVID to social unrest, 2020 has felt like 10 years packed into one. Because of this, I think there's no better time to get into the spirit of Christmas - the religious stuff if you're into that, the joy of giving presents, and most importantly being with family even if that means not physically.  
  
So this December 25th, indulge yourself in alcohol, presents, and of course a truck-load of food. Go on, you deserve it. And if you're by yourself this year and maybe can't get into the atmosphere as much, do yourself a favour and look at some of the great decorations over on the /r/Christmas.

Most of what I write, at least when it comes to politics and other controversial subjects, is satirical, sarcastic, or something of that nature. Not today. Today is a good day. Today I get to feature a subreddit dedicated to one of the few politicians I actually like. One of the few politicians whom I don't need to defend or say ""it could be worse"" when I talk about. Let me state this, unequivocally and clearly: I would, in a heartbeat, vote for President Ocasio-Cortez.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman to serve in the US Congress. Perhaps due to her youthfulness, she mostly interacts with supporters on Twitter and other social media rather than the dusty newsletters sent out by the staff of the assistant of Congressman Elmer B. Oldman. Her fundraising is primarily grassroots, allowing her to reflect the will of the people of New York's 14th district rather than the big corporations who typically fund congresspeople to ignore the people. She is, as an advocate for the people, a progressive Democrat that believes in plenty of great things, like feeding the hungry, showing compassion for the suffering, and helping your fellow humans, which earn her the scorn of the Republican Party, as she goes against their most core beliefs in those ideals.

As one might expect, she's attracted fans and haters aplenty. Part of the reason for both is that she isn't the least bit demure; attacking her on Twitter is a bad move, because she enjoys tearing people apart with the kind of brutal honesty that is as refreshing to see in politics as water in a desert. This has given rise to a second subreddit, /r/MurderedByAOC, which catalogs the countless thrashings she delivers to others. This holiday season, why don't you treat yourself to the always-appreciated gift of watching some right-wing politicians get shut down and made to look like bickering children in front of a global audience? I'll bake cookies, you bring the eggnog, and we can all laugh at Ted Cruz. As is tradition.

/r/AOC has some of the greatest hits of the Congresswoman's verbal smackdowns and earnest education on display. [Look at this one which, at the time of this writing, is semi-recent.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AOC/comments/k42t8h/aoc_on_lobbyist_influence_in_the_democratic_party/) I love it when she talks about lobbyist and corporate power over politics. The words ""corporate control plagues our whole system"" are as sweet as candy to me. Compared to any normal politician, AOC is ahead of the curve. Compared to America's politicians, she's an outstretched hand from real civilization reaching back to try and drag our Mad Max dystopia into the light. America's a rough place to be if you're poor and underprivileged. It's nice that someone in power acknowledges that.

As an aside, can you believe that /r/AOC gained about 22,000 subscribers during the time it took me to feature this? It didn't take long, let's put it that way. It's wickedly fast growing. Even that number will be out of date by tomorrow when this goes live, which is just great.

Here's to you, /r/AOC. I hope someday we can all (us non-New Yorkers, I mean) cast our votes for her and, for once in our lives, be uncompromisingly proud to call someone our President.

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is a mouthful of a title, so many fans just call it TenseiSlime, after its Japanese title, Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken. It's also called Tensura, but I haven't seen that used too much. It is what it says on the box: The story of somebody who got reincarnated as a slime. Would you believe that a little blue ball of jelly could turn out to be simultaneously an intelligent and capable person, an adorable and lovable character, and devourer of living gods, all while still being the star of a great series? I've watched my fair share of isekai anime where the overpowered protagonist barrels through the story with neither challenge nor serious entertainment, and to compare something like Wise Man's Grandchild to my boi Rimuru is sacrilegious. It'd be like trying to compare Curly Joe to John von Neumann. Let me explain it in a way you can understand.

[He is adorable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TenseiSlime/comments/kgixe0/rimuru_tempest/) That ought to have covered it, but I'll continue. He pisses panacea and can turn tiny elderly people into JoJo characters. Benimaru loyally serves him ~~in his harem~~, and you may know his VA, Makoto Furukawa, as Saitama from One Punch Man. My boy Rimuru is just that great.

Speaking of his followers, he's got a lot of them. Unlike other protagonists, Rimuru puts in work and changes the game from Dragon Quest to Civilization pretty early on, founding a nation and improving it with his knowledge from a background in contracting and development in modern Tokyo. I *think* Rimuru's from our near-future, since I believe he mentions Final Fantasy 17 at some point, but that series has had trouble in the past with counting properly, so who knows? Well, that knowledge, and supreme power of being able to create manga (sacred texts) on demand, has lead to prosperity for all. I couldn't count all of his followers if I spent hours doing so, so I'll just give a shout out to my favorite follower of his: Shion, his secretary. From her first scenes to her latest, it's all been great. The runner-up may be Veldora, the world's most powerful tsundere, but we haven't seen enough of him yet for me to call him a favorite.

Now, do note that I am only caught up on the anime and manga, not the light novels. They're downloaded and in my library, but I haven't got around to reading them. I'm really lazy when it comes to starting new things. Somebody I know told me that the LNs are boring because they go into tons of detail about the construction of Tempest, and that immediately made me want to read them even more. I live for those details. Everything I've read and heard is positive, so it's on my to-read list, but I need a kick in the ass to do it. It should also be noted that there's a Web Novel as well, and I recently got told by a commenter to read that, but I'm not sold just yet.

So, with all that out of the way, we return to /r/TenseiSlime. As you expect, and know from our recent features of similar kinds of communities, it's a fan subreddit for the series focused on discussion, debate, fan art, and memes, which I picked to feature because it's full of great and friendly people, [has a strong FAQ for newcomers](https://www.reddit.com/r/TenseiSlime/comments/giosud/frequently_asked_questions_that_time_i_got/), and is a subreddit I personally enjoy. It's going to be picking up much more steam in the coming months as the second season of the anime will be airing beginning in January, and I'm excited to see the episodic activity return. From what I remember, that period in the manga was incredible, so anime-only fans are in for a real treat. I imagine the LN fans feel the same when I get a new manga chapter.

They're also fellow men and women of culture who recognize Rimuru as a divine being of supreme adorableness. [Just look!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TenseiSlime/comments/kazw88/wink/) This is fine art right here.

Anyway, give the anime a watch, then join us in January for season 2, when you can be a part of the live airing fun. If you like the series, try out the manga, check out some side stories, and, of course, grab the light novels and, unlike me, actually start them.

Modernity is overrated. Technology has made us poor branch-swingers. Inside, you long for the trees, the canopy, the green of nature. Your soul cries out in this gray concrete world, your eyes burning as they stare endlessly into a screen of store-bought light, never knowing the sight of the infinite stars. Life is complicated; work, capitalism, war, debt, struggle. You know it's not real. It's not what life is supposed to be.

They're the machines of man's own making in our quest to punish ourselves for our hubris in thinking we could claim the Earth. Thinking we could live forever by building Hell atop the barren land of what was once our Garden of Eden.

It's not the way it should be.

Couldn't it have been different?

What choices would you make if we could do it all over again?

Would you not be content to relax in the sun, never knowing stress or grief?

Would you really miss the hardship you left behind?

Or the hollow person you once were?

No.

Reject humanity.

Goblin Slayer. A light novel series by Kumo Kagyu released in 2016 and slated for manga, anime, action figures, and protagonist body pillows almost immediately. Unlike a lot of popular anime, which focus on energy beams, harems, and the power of friendship, Goblin Slayer is about comparatively low-level adventurers in a somewhat bleak world who only seem to interact with the bleakest, darkest, and worst part of it: Goblins.

These aren't the goblins from /r/TenseiSlime. They're not lovable, friendly, or good. These are goblins that deserve nothing but a quick death; not for their benefit, but for the benefit of everyone else in ensuring that they don't live a second longer. The only good goblins are the ones that never crawl out of their stinking holes, but as they're too big of assholes to just stay down there, in practice the only good goblin is a dead goblin. Goblin Slayer knows this. He knows this so damn well that nobody even knows his name. He's just the Goblin Slayer. He's the one that makes goblins of all kinds hear boss music when he shows up.

But he is not alone. In keeping with the tradition of calling everyone only by their careers or races, he's joined by Priestess, Elf Archer, Dwarf Shaman, and Lizard Priest. Honestly, I don't think anyone has any names, or if they do, I don't know of them. This practice stems somewhat from Goblin Slayer's prevailing theme of being a tabletop game played by the gods. These gods are sadistic shits, but they're gods, so what can you really expect?

In the same vein as other series subreddits, /r/GoblinSlayer is the reddit hub for fans of the series. Though typically geared toward those who've read the light novel, it's welcoming to all. Admittedly, I've had the LNs for a while and just haven't got around to reading them, having been distracted by a few other series. I'll get to it, I swear! Still, in the meantime, I'll check out some of their nice fan art, read something, inevitably get spoiled, and be protected by my dumb swiss cheese brain and forget everything by the time I get around to reading the LNs (tomorrow for sure).

Seriously, though. Give it a try. It's a fantastic anime, and from what I've seen, the manga's up to the same standard, so let that be your introduction if you have the same kind of patience and inability to start new things as I do. Then, read the books and come back to speculate on whether Burglar is off stealing from a dragon in a company of dwarves or not, or if we'll ever find out anyone's real name, or if the DM of the gods will ever throw in their setting-breaking homebrew and rock Goblin Slayer out with a plasma rifle. Y'know, the usual stuff.

And remember: The only good goblin is a dead goblin!

RTGame is the name (from birth, I assume) of a [YouTube/Twitch variety gaming content creator,](https://www.youtube.com/c/RTGame) which is a longer title than I thought it would be. He plays games and shows people the games and people laugh. Starting with Team Fortress 2, he later abandoned the world's foremost hat simulator and associated shooter minigame to play things like Minecraft, Pokemon, and other games, usually what's popular.

Well, what I like about him is that he's funny, has a relaxing Irish voice, and his videos are typically the perfect length to eat dinner to. Life's boring when all you eat is rice and potatoes, but somehow, he makes those potatoes taste better. He's not the channel you put on if you want your world rocked like a fistful of shady pills. He's the channel you put on to relax after a hard day's work at the shady pills factory. Even for a jaded old fart like me, the day just gets a little brighter when I see a new RT video.

Besides just sorting by popularity, he's put together [a playlist of his best videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLliBvQE3gg9dk314FkAlVcTqnnKUHLfSx), which should start you off. Personally, I like his [Cities: Skylines videos, which can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLliBvQE3gg9dNVEj6v6iXaTqqrZYwFc7e). I wish every channel had their games sorted into playlists like he does; it's a small thing, I know, but I'm a small-minded man.

You may have seen some of his Minecraft videos shared around, actually. Typically, they take the form of him gathering hundreds of players and making them do things, like dig a giant hole, build Greenland, and die of starvation. Imagine actually producing quality, entertaining Minecraft videos in 2020. Like the rest of his content, they're basically a meme factory for fans to fill the world with cute animals with fleshy interiors, enormous, beautiful works of architectural art, and a Tesco. It's peak Minecraft building, and if you're a fan of the game, you definitely need to watch those.

I should also mention that he's not always alone. He plays with a group called The Irish Lads, who are connected through their mutual love of candy bracelets. No, hang on, it's their nationality. Always get those two mixed up. Anyway, shout outs to /r/CallMeKevin, /r/Jackscepticeye, and /r/NoglaOfficial. I haven't actually watched these fellas much, so I can't tell you much about them, but together, the four of them work well. They're simultaneously a mixture of the ""my last few brain cells"" meme and a hidden camera show where a babysitter is trying to prevent calamity at the hands of chaotic children, except there is no babysitter. Additional shout outs to Daithi De Nogla for having a name that doubles as an Irish shibboleth.

There's no better thing that I can say beyond ""go watch a couple videos and see for yourself"". That's how media like this tends to be. Watch it, then come back and check out /r/RTGameCrowd. You'll need the context, because otherwise none of the thousand memes will make sense to you and you'll become horrified at the strange fanart that depicts RT as RT-D2, the Irish droid, or something. (That's probably not real, but give it time.)

So, there it is. If you're looking for a recommendation, this is it. Go give him a look.

**29,346 readers** for **9 years!**

The West Wing was a political TV drama that ran from 1999 to 2006. It was created by Aaron Sorkin, the renowned writer/director behind works like The Newsroom, A Few Good Men, The Social Network, and Enemy of the State, among others. It revolves around the staff of the President of the United States, whose offices are within the West Wing of the White House. Featuring drama, intrigue, campaigns, and an awe-inspiring rendition of Ronny Jordan's 1993 hit 'The Jackal', it was a hit show during its airtime and has created an enduring fanbase full of nutcases who rewatch the whole thing every year or so.

As a fellow nutcase, The West Wing is to me a bittersweet memory of a time when America had hope in its political system. Prior to Sorkin's leave from the show at the end of season 4, it showed the system as it ought to have been. Politicians on both sides of the aisle were more honest, believing in their platforms and doing what they thought was best to advance the causes they believed in. Democrats and Republicans could respect each other because they both believed in doing what's right for America, only disagreeing on how they were to do it. Following the project being picked up by John Wells for season 5 onward, it began to show the system as it was, full of posturing, lying, and using the electorate more as a tool than an object of purpose.

Of course, even the darkest predictions of The West Wing paled to reality in the end, and the prestige and authority of the presidency it shows is just another joke in an already funny show, but we'll ignore that for now.

Fourteen years after the show's ending, fans continue to watch and discuss the series with each other with all the familiarity of a show in its prime. Commonly, there are discussions over Wells and Sorkin, whether Toby was right to do what he did in a certain arc, and listing reasons why Leo is the show's true heartthrob. There's also actor discussion, though it's not as common. Does anyone remember when Matt Santos moved to Miami and started killing people in Dexter? Has anyone noticed how old Bradley Whitford looks now? He looks like he's about to drop the hottest night-time political talk show episode of all time.

Fun bit of personal trivia, actually: It was my love and repeated viewings of The West Wing that made me go to the doctor when I first started noticing some weird health issues that I remembered Jed Bartlet having. Unfortunately, unlike the President, I don't seem to have the ""good kind"" of MS. Still, I have to thank Aaron Sorkin for giving me a heads up.

There's not much else to say, given that fan subreddits for shows are often alike. So instead I'll dedicate this last bit of time to formally recommend the show to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's a fantastic series, and if you need any additional persuasion, well, consider the following: It's got Martin Sheen as the POTUS.

Give it a go, then come to /r/TheWestWing and talk about why your favorite character is CJ, or, if you have a different favorite character, talk about why you're wrong.

**135,302 readers** for **8 years!**

I confess, dear readers, to being a weeb, though not as big of one as some of my friends. I've watched a lot of anime and read some good manga. Yet, to date, I've only read a couple of light novel series. Why is that, given that I read a lot? Well, most series just don't interest me enough to go through the effort of reading a series of books. Would you really want to read Dragon Ball Z: The Novel?

> ""And this..."" Goku spoke, readying himself.

> ""Eh!? What's he doing!?"" Gasped Master Roshi atop the Lookout, his mind's eye focused on his student's image.

> ""Is to go even further beyond!"" Goku exclaimed, and from him rushed a torrent of great power, growing and ceaseless, until it threatened to engulf the world.

> ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!""

Yeah, that's just not as fun for me, either. I want to *hear* Goku yelling and powering up. I want to *see* the reactions. I want the music, the voices, or at the very least, manga panels showing me what's going on. How else can I stare longingly at Krillin's beautiful baldness, hearing the sweet voice of Monkey D. Luffy coming from him and wishing, just once, he'd yell ""Gomu Gomu no Destructo Disc""? Not through a book, that's how.

So what made me want to read Overlord's entire collection of 14 novels, side novel, and dozen-ish side story novellas in the span of a few days? It wasn't just boredom. They're actually just that good. From someone who touts his Goodreads list like a better man might tout a happy life, family, home, or other accomplishments, it's one of the best series I've read. The author, Maruyama Kugane, is owed a bucket full of awards for his writing, which shines through even after being translated. It's a fantastic series with lovable and memorable characters, a deep lore, great world building, and lots and lots for the fanbase to discuss and debate.

Which brings me back to /r/Overlord. They are my fellows, the ones who acknowledge this series for what it is: A gem, competing with the rest of the isekai trash in its wake for attention, but more deserving than most series of its kind for it. The fanbase, the largest on the internet for the series that I could find, spend their time discussing, debating, and theorizing, mostly with questions about who would win in a fight, but not always. Much like a desert, there's also a lot of thirst going around, but that's every similar subreddit, I suppose.

What I like most about /r/Overlord, though, is how nice it is. Everybody's just swell. Despite having over a hundred thousand subscribers, it still acts like a small niche community in a lot of ways. You learn to recognize the regulars; which ones are great men of culture and which ones don't love Mare, that kind of thing. It's one of the examples I'd pull out to describe a great fan community if I had friends or anyone who would ask me about this kind of thing. They may also ask me who my favorite character is, to which I'd begin my long essay on the merits of every single one of them, from overlooked originals like Cocytus and famed waifus like Shalltear to New Worlders like Neia and Brain, before I finally tell the truth. It is the great Phillip-kakka, of course. Second is Neia, though. I've only had Neia for three volumes but if anything were to happen to her I'd kill everyone in the New World and then myself.

So you may be asking: ""Should I watch Overlord?"" My gut answer's ""yes"", of course, but I'll talk some more, because why not. If you want an isekai that isn't trash, watch Overlord. If you like Isekai Quartet but are confused by the weird bone daddy and his friends, watch Overlord. If you want an old school D&D-like fantasy series with lots of meta twists and Japanese influence, watch Overlord. Overlord is a whole world of cool that's meant to be dived into and experienced, not just passively suffered through with your phone out like Sword Art Online or your weird uncle's fourth wedding.

Watch it. No, don't add it to your list and promise you'll get to it soon and then find it five years from now; watch it. Then, if you like it, read the light novels. There's an FAQ stickied on /r/Overlord to help you out, and questions are always welcome. You can ask me anything, just don't ask me to dinner. ... Please ask me to dinner, actually. I yearn for social contact.

Alright, that about does it. Leave questions about the series in the comments if you wish. I may or may not reply to them all with ""Sasuga, Ainz-sama"", depending on my mood.

&nbsp;

To listen to and ""understand"" music generally takes a bit of experience, and a familiarity with the genre. A level up from that is being able to analyse music with some degree of rigour, being able to identify not just the what, but also the how, of what makes the music sound how it does. And it's another big step up from being able to analyse music to being able to compose your own, whether that be classical music, hip-hop, rock, jazz, or really any genre. Being a composer is a difficult job, arguably one of the most difficult paths a musician can go down. But it's the composers that create the soundscapes found in the world around us, whether they be classical composers or more recent film composers, like [Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDsCtDRV2uA) and [Joe Hisaishi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBADF1LdP3g). A massive amount of time and creative energy goes into writing music, and for aspiring composers, it can be extremely off-putting, seeing all these great composers and wondering how you could ever compare (and as a composer myself, I speak from experience). That's why it can be so helpful to have a place where you can discuss composition with others, and /r/Composer is just such a place!

/r/Composer is separate from /r/ClassicalMusic and /r/MusicTheory, in that it specialises in the compositional process of music: While /r/MusicTheory focuses on analysing music and learning theoretical techniques (things which are very much important for learning to compose), and /r/ClassicalMusic is broader still, this subreddit is geared towards aiding amateur composers of all levels. Whether you're looking to find out the basics, get feedback on your compositions, or even looking to commission music (or take commissions yourself), this sub is the prime place on Reddit to do so!

It's been 9 long years since [/r/Composer was last featured here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/jtl40/august_25_2011_rcomposer_do_you_really_think_i/) by the man himself, /u/SRotD, and since then it's grown 100 times the size, amassing 35,000 subscribers, an active community filled with composers of all skill levels, an expansive sidebar & [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/wiki/index), and more!

This week is Classical Music Week, so it would stand to reason that the ""main"" sub being featured this week is /r/ClassicalMusic (which we featured [here!](https://redd.it/kb2c16)). However, as much as I love that sub, I really believe that /r/TheRedditSymphony is the star subreddit here. It's most likely the largest virtual orchestra on the internet.

These days the idea of a Virtual Orchestra is relatively widespread, as the Coronavirus has forced everyone to stay at home; many of the largest philharmonic orchestras in the world have done their own (usually scaled down) performances, including the [New York Philharmonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3UW218_zPo), [Rotterdams Philharmonisch Orkest](https://youtu.be/3eXT60rbBVk?t=44), and dozens more. 

But the Reddit Symphony Orchestra has been doing this for a long time now; since [their brilliant first performance of the Avengers theme song](https://redd.it/8sqzkj), all the way back in June of 2018, they have done a whopping 67 performances of music from all genres (with many more on the way), they've done [classical music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1Xljyi8tI), [video game music](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheRedditSymphony/comments/ijwtdx/gerudo_valley_performed_by_the_reddit_symphony/) (this one in particular is just amazing), even music [written by other Redditors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMOTe42aZ4Y). I mean, 67 performances is just *staggering*. That's hundreds of talented musicians who have taken the time to prepare and perform their part for it. And as a musician who has partaken in virtual orchestras before, it's a *lot* more difficult than you'd imagine, even for parts that would otherwise be simple in a regular orchestral environment. And it goes even farther than just performers too, the RSO has people organising, editing, and even arranging the music being played. It's an entire operation.

If you play an instrument, I highly recommend checking out this subreddit, and looking into participating; the parts are generally not too difficult, and the community is extremely welcoming to anyone interested in taking part ~~(because, like all orchestras, they're desperate for players)~~. And if you're not a musician, I mean, the sub is still sweet, in my professional opinion, it's one of the sweetest subs on Reddit.

If you're at all interested in participating, or are just curious about the process, there's lots of information on the /r/TheRedditSymphony sidebar, including [an FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditSymphony/wiki/index#wiki_faq.3A) and [how to participate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQ0DItfvdwLV25SjEWNtCRF5g7BZjxiQQy7yC_atWLw/edit?usp=sharing).

&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/CasuallyNothing** Well, I made this! Don't worry, I'll expand on that, but the long-short of it is I wanted to play music, so I made a virtual orchestra!


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>>  **/u/CasuallyNothing** It's honestly... *too easy.* I have no idea where these people came from, but they literally don't do anything bad. I'm scared... /s


> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/u/CasuallyNothing** Can I say all of them? Well, I'll toss out a few:

>> * A staple, [our definitive REAL guide on playing with the RSO!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditSymphony/comments/hluc60/official_guide_on_recording_for_the_rso/)

>> * Some more serious ones would be ['La Nuit'](https://youtu.be/FnmaEESmQH0) which is especially incredible because the indivdual who mixed this, basically learned how to do that because they joined our community!

>> * [Breaking the Blue](https://youtu.be/bCoAfyA2wgI) is again, another incredible one because this piece was an original composed by this person, then they organized it all as a project, got recordings for it, and mixed together a performance of it! That's as home-grown as it gets!

>> * And of course, how could I leave out where it all started? [The Avengers Theme Song!](https://youtu.be/pUjWCBxlRRQ)


> **4: Tell us a bit about The Reddit Symphony. Where did the idea to create this project come from?**

>> **/u/CasuallyNothing** The short story is that; I'm a trombonist, and in real life I didn't have many opportunites to play near me. I took to the internet in search of a virtual orchestra, because *surely* this must already be a thing, right? Well, it was a thing... in like 2011... with professional orchestras. There was also the short-lived /r/redditsymphony that I missed by *literally* just a month or two. It never took off, but maybe I would've been able to help it get started. So, with the naive thought of ""It can't be that hard"" I whipped up /r/TheRedditSymphony, and took creating our first performance: *The Avengers Theme Song!* I won't bore you with the details, but it was a success in my book, and we've been off to the races ever since!


> **5: How has the sub changed since the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic, now that most people are familiar with programs like Zoom, and now that other orchestras are doing their own online recordings?**

>> **/u/CasuallyNothing** Well, we've definitely gained some traction during this time, but it's honestly hard to tell whether it's purely *because* of COVID, or because we're spreading the word about us well enough generally. I'd like to think it's a mix between the two, and hopefully once the reigns are put on this situation globally, we'll still be able to grow our community and perform together!



> **6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/CasuallyNothing** Well, generally I'd like there to be more opportunities for everyone to participate in some capacity. The muscians, of course, but also even having aspiring composers get their music played as well. We've done a 'Composition Competition' once before- to massive success- and that is currently our plan to have a yearly- or even bi-annual competition of this sort to give that opportunity to our up-and-coming composers. And of course just growing our community in general!


> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/CasuallyNothing**  Is it too shameless to plug our YouTube channel? Listen, I'm a little biased, but these are some SERIOUSLY impressive performances, all done virtually, by a wide range of musicians, with some really talented individuals organizing, and mixing, these multi-genre performances. And as we figure out this process, we're only getting better! ~~Be sure to like, comment, and subscribe!~~ Too cliche? But sincerely, we do all this so that we all- performers and audience alike- can enjoy these performances brought to life by a group of musicians who otherwise may have never even met each other. Check out some of our 60+ performances here! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAl3fvW4KndiZAQtPmFCUFD6nImDC89Gv

^(*""oh but srotd jazz isn't classical music why is it in the classical music week you should have named the week Western Art Music & Early-Mid 20th Century Popular Music week if you're goin-""* SHUT UP I LIKE JAZZ TOO OK)

^(*""also srotd that title is a reference to a swing piece not jazz it even says swing right there did you even try with this feat-""*)

Jazz is an huge genre, with a range of music stretching pretty much a full century (or longer, depending on your definition). The music in it ranges from nice and relaxing to absolutely fucking insane. The amount of complexity and history behind the genre is immense and easily rivals the likes of classical music (which we've covered extensively earlier on this week, click [here](https://redd.it/kb2c16) if you haven't seen that!). But oddly, it seems to have been lost in the public eye somewhat. While classical music lives on as the cool orchestral genre ~~(iT hAs aN oRcHeStRa sO iT mUsT bE ClAsSiCaL)~~, jazz has gained the reputation for being somewhat difficult to listen to, and thus people don't. The most you get is simplified background music, or smooth jazz. And yeah, it's often really, *really* complex, it could be argued that it's more complex than music from the classical era, but I don't believe that's a bad thing. I believe it to be a very good quality, in fact. So if you clicked on this not caring much for jazz and not listening to any jazz more complex than [Fly Me to the Moon](https://youtu.be/mQR0bXO_yI8) (which is an absolute tune in and of itself, despite it being swing and not jazz but ok I'll just stop talking now), I'll try and break it down a little bit. 


Jazz is just a bunch of trumpets and saxophones playing the wrong notes.

....

.... Okay, okay, jokes aside, as a middle class Irish classical musician, I am not the right person to be explaining jazz to people, and I'd probably get it wrong and offend a good lot of people if I tried. Broadly speaking, it's defined by heavy use of improvisation, swing, complex harmonies and similarities to ragtime and blues, but that's the surface level Wikipedia tier definition, if you want a better explanation, you'll be hard pressed to find one in writing; your best bet is to just listen to jazz and figure it out. As Louis Armstrong said, ""If you have to ask, you'll never know"". I think this concludes the irrelevant mindless rambling section of the feature. Now onto the subreddit of the day itself, /r/Jazz!

/r/Jazz is a sub that's been going on for quite some time now. 12 years, in fact. In that time it has been the hub of jazz discussion on Reddit. Whether you're looking to find new jazz to listen to, looking for feedback on your own jazz or jazz solos, or just looking to talk about certain bits of music or artists, /r/jazz is the place to go. The sub is filled with all levels of jazz musicians, and really musicians in general (ie. Classically trained clarinettists wishing they had saxophones, no im not speaking from experience shut up). For any aspiring cats, there's a wealth of information on the sidebar, and the community is filled with wonderful people that'd be sure to help you out with whatever you need!


&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/r/Jazz Moderator** There was a call asking for more moderators several years, ago, and as a veteran reddit moderator and jazz musician, I thought I was a natural fit, so I took up the job moderating /r/jazz


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/r/Jazz Moderator** Moderating /r/jazz pretty chill. Our subscribers do a great job of staying on topic, and being respectful for the most part. The mod team mostly let's the community decide what they want to see with up votes and down votes. It is rare that the moderation team has to intervene other than dealing with spam, or the occasional troll.


> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/r/Jazz Moderator** I really like the jazz listening club. It's a great opportunity for members to come together and share opinions. It also lets us discuss an entire album rather than one song at a time like we do for most posts. There was a series a while back where users were posting their take on improvising over a new song every week. Sadly that died out after a while, but it was really fun while it lasted.


> **4: What's your favourite jazz album, and who's your favourite jazz artist?**

>> **/r/Jazz Moderator** There are too many favorite albums to list them all, but Giant Steps is a great classic. for the more modern sound We Like it Here by Snarky Puppy gets a ton of listening time. My favorite Jazz artist is Dizzy Gillespie. Manteca was the first Jazz song that I listened too because I wanted to, not because it was homework or part of studying for jazz band when I was growing up. His ability to combine swing, afro-cuban rhythms, and bebop is something else.


> **5: How do you recommend people get into jazz if they've never listened to it/paid attention to it before?**

>> **/r/Jazz Moderator** This is a really hard question. There's such a wide variety of jazz styles and crossovers with other genres. I would say give it all a try until you find something you like, and then dig into the artists that played on the song you like. Most jazz musicians play in several projects, so chances are really good that once you find something you like, there's a lot more to uncover. Look for guest appearances and side projects from the musicians you like.


> **6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/r/Jazz Moderator** We don't plan on changing things much. The subreddit is a haven for jazz enthusiasts, where we keep jazz music front and center. That's a rarity among music subreddits, and we're content to keep things as they are for now.


> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>>**/r/Jazz Moderator** If you're interested in learning more about Jazz, we've got a lot of great tools in the sidebar of /r/jazz including a wiki for people just discovering jazz for the first time and links to every past listening club post (there are over 200 of them!).

**364,939** theorists *modulating* for **11 years**!

&nbsp;

It was the artist Wassily Kandinsky that said *""Music is the art which has devoted itself not to the reproduction of natural phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist's soul""*. In other words, music has an ability to achieve abstraction far greater than, say, a painting does. Or to simplify further, music isn't limited by the medium which it's created on, and it can evoke an emotion by itself, without needing to imitate real life. Kandinsky is often considered one of the pioneers of abstract art, art like [this](https://www.wassilykandinsky.net/images/works/57.jpg). His ideas about art were heavily inspired by ideas found in music, stating that *""music is the ultimate teacher""*. He was a Russian living in the musical Late Romantic & Impressionist periods, and the popular music at the time would have been from the likes of [Wagner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA), [Tchaikovsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_kJosheX7k), [Rachmaninoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21z-K5ChWbE). This music was all very focused on expression and emotion, far from the regular, strict structures found in the works of Mozart or Haydn. It is a wonder that with the same set of tools, one can create such different works of music. And that brings up the big question, how? How does one even begin with writing music? That's where the wide world of Music Theory comes in.


/r/MusicTheory is a place where you can ask questions about all things music theory: writing music, analysing music, arranging, discussing pieces of music whether it be classical, jazz, or even pop & hiphop. All music has theory behind it, whether it's western classical, terrible Soundcloud rapping, or even traditional Japanese music. Though, let's be real, this is Reddit and it's extremely Western-centric, the /r/Musictheory sub is mostly geared towards Western Classical music. It's a sub that has been a hub of discussion for 11 whole years! That's worth a commendation.

Even if you don't know much about music theory, this sub is still a vastly helpful and informative sub. The community is super welcoming to newcomers of any level. For those wishing to learn more about theory, the sidebar has many useful resources, and there are many years of posts you can search to answer any questions you may have. In short, the /r/MusicTheory sub is the best place for anyone wishing to learn more about music in general, not just classical music, but all music, and I recommend any musicians here go check it out!

&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **u/nmitchell076** I was an undergrad theory nerd ca. 2011, when a friend of mind was like ""have you ever been to /r/musictheory, it's such an elitist circlejerk!"" That always sticks out to me, because when I actually came here, I found the opposite to be true. So anyway, I just hung out around the sub for a while, until I started grad school and found out one of my peers was a mod (/u/vornska), and after a bit, he invited me to the mod team, and I've been here ever sense!

>> **u/Zarlinosuke** I realized gradually over the years that whenever I asked Google an off-the-beaten-path music theory question, it would more often than not lead me to this sub, and I found myself generally impressed with the level of both thought and respect that I saw here, especially given Reddit's general reputation. Lurking for years eventually turned into posting occasionally, and then I just so happened to end up in a fun music-theoretical conversation with one of the mods at around the time they were looking for more people to join the team, and so I did!

> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>>  **u/nmitchell076** Easier now with more mods! It has never been a very hard sub to mod though. We aren't that big, we don't attract many trolls, and our user base is generally exceedingly well-behaved.

>> **u/Zarlinosuke** So far it's been quite enjoyable. It's for the most part not too different from what it was like posting here before my days as a mod, in large part because discussions thankfully tend to be kind and civil. Keeping an eye out for a few rule violations is something I'm used to from teaching counterpoint anyway, and so for the most part it's just the nice feeling of getting to talk about music theory a lot and helping others to do so.

> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>>  **u/nmitchell076** Hands down, [musical lemmings](https://amp.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/2fr83k/musical_lemmings/), the time cube of music theory. In fact, you'll see a comment of mine in there saying ""this is my favorite post"" and it remains true to this day!

>> But in all seriousness, I think my substantive favorite post was a thread from our now-defunct Article of the Month series where the author of an article on punk music (Dave Easley) [unexpectedly showed up to](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/3e77q6/aotm_analytical_appetizer_how_punk_riffs_work) our discussion of his article. It was... spirited, to say the least. But I always really admire the way Dave was able to transform what was initially a quite hostile response to his article (you academics don't get punk!) into a space of really productive dialogue between fellow punk enthusiasts.

>> **u/Zarlinosuke** This isn't something that I have much of a record of, unfortunately. But I see brilliant things around every day!

> **4: Music theory can seem extremely daunting to a beginner. How do you recommend people get started with it?**

>>  **u/nmitchell076** If you are really just getting started, I think you want to get a solid grounding in the basics by someone who has a lot of experience teaching students. You really do want a textbook, and a quality one, since there's a lot of really bad theory textbooks out there... but happily, there is a really great open source, totally free music theory textbook: [Open Music Theory](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/front-matter/introduction/), which begins with an AP-music-theory-level fundamentals section and goes all the way through an entire undergraduate theory curriculum, and even has sections on pop and jazz theory! One of our mods /u/m3g0wnz, is actually one of the authors!

>> We have a lot more apps, videos, and visual aids in our sidebar and FAQ as well, but I really think making Open Music Theory the core of your learning experience will do wonders for you!

>> **u/Zarlinosuke**  I can speak only from my own experience, but I know that it helped me a lot that I was never trying to learn theory as some dull means to an end. It's simply that I wanted to learn more about the music I enjoyed, and I had experience with that music both as a player and as a listener, and I wanted to learn to compose like that too, so I started reading up on the materials and techniques that were involved. It was thus never just an abstract pile of words and numbers for me--the music came first, and theoretical terms were mostly just of the ""oh that's the name for that thing I already know about"" type. Thus I think everyone should start from the music they both know and love--not only will the study be more enjoyable, but it will make way more sense.

> **5: Tell us an interesting theory fact!**

>>  **u/nmitchell076** The months of the year map onto the the keyboard in a really interesting way: if each of the twelve keys in an octave are one of the 12 months of the year, then all the months that have 31 days are white keys, and all months that have a different number of days are black keys. So like, starting on January as F (31 days), the month ahead of it is a 28-day black key (F#=February) and the month behind it is a 31-day white key (E=December), and it turns out you can systematically map all the months onto the piano this way!

>> I have no idea why the months are like this. But it's certainly neat!

>> **u/Zarlinosuke**  Chinese musicians and music theorists devised something a lot like twelve-tone equal temperament, long before that was a thing in Western music--some even think that seventeenth-century Europeans got that idea from China! At the same time, China appears to have gotten the idea of rotatable diatonic scales from Indian musicians. The music-theoretical worlds of long ago were far more connected that we moderns tend to assume, and so it should be no coincidence that we find surprisingly familiar concepts in supposedly unfamiliar systems.

> **6: The /r/MusicTheory subreddit, and really all of modern music theory, is very much focused on Western classical music, and general Western ideas of tonality and music as a whole. What do you think of this? Do you feel it's something that needs to be changed, or is it fine the way it is?**

>>  **u/nmitchell076** So, I think any opportunity that one has to do antiracist work, to have counter-hegemonic conversations, to make the world more equitable, and to dismantle white supremacy is a good thing. Of course, I think where these conversations matter the most is at the level of the academic institution: its really professors, textbook writers, grant committees, etc. that need to get their ass in gear!

>> As for the subreddit, it's a tricky line to walk. Because in general, we take a hands-off approach to moderation. We are more like conversation facilitators than content creators. So I suppose my view is that the subreddit will change if its users want to, I don't see it as my place to direct its focus as a mod.

>> That said, we do provide services and subreddit features: the FAQ, the composition challenges, etc. These are places where we have some more direct control over what we want the subreddit to be. And so periodically, we should perhaps look at those features and make sure they encourage thoughtful engagement with diverse repertoires.

>> **u/Zarlinosuke**  I do think we're at a point at which it makes sense to expand the discipline more into other types of music. While it's no surprise that a discipline based in an English-speaking and majority-white cultural sphere would found itself on European classical music, we're clearly living in a time in which that heavy Western classical dominance is no longer satisfying to a high number of people who are interested in music theory, and that's for several reasons relating both to the changing populations of our field and schools and to the wider cultural climate around us now. Some alarmists seem to think that calls for greater diversity are also calls to cancel Western music, or to consign it to an ""evil"" bin, but I really don't now anyone who genuinely feels that. We seem generally agreed that Western classical music should continue to be studied--it's just that current curricula are so heavily based on it that it seems like there's plenty of room to be made to remove some amount of it in one's required course load to make room for other musics. Furthermore, the resources out there for self-study in Western classical music have never been better, and anyone who's curious can dive in as deep as they'd like.

> **7: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>>  **u/nmitchell076** Well, I'm working on final edits on an academic article about the subreddit! To appear in the Oxford Handbook of Public Music Theory, so stay tuned!

>> I'd like to develop a recurring subreddit feature that encourages users to think critically about various ethical issues in music making. A thread that would, say, prompt people to talk about appropriation (and not just in the shallow ways its often discussed), colonialist legacies, antiracism, copyright lawsuits and the role of analysis in those cases. And so on. Basically to say ""hey, the world's out there, how might theory interact with it?"" But I think to make this feature work, we'd need to build a compelling set of discussion prompts, and also get someone who is willing to diligently moderate those conversations. But it is something I think would be valuable!

>> **u/Zarlinosuke** I don't have any particular plans, and am happy to let the user base determine its future, provided it doesn't turn into some ugly ""non-Western music is inferior"" platform, which I somehow doubt would happen.

> **8: Anything else you want to add?**

>>  **u/nmitchell076** Not while my dissertation needs editing!

**11,776** players *blaming their reed* for **9 years**!


&nbsp;

There are many woodwind instruments in the orchestra. In fact, the particularly perceptive amongst you may have also noticed that, indeed, there are a lot of instruments in the orchestra in general. So why am I featuring /r/clarinet above the rest of the instrument subs, you may ask? Two reasons. One, I play clarinet and am absolutely biased, and two... Well... Okay that's really the main thing but still this sub is really good trust me.

^(yeah I'm not selling this one very well am I)

Anyways, r/Clarinet is a sub for all things related to the musical instrument, [the *clarinet*], which if you're unfamiliar, is a woodwind instrument that uses a cane reed vibrating into a bored cylindrical wooden pipe to create sound. Or in other words, you blow into it and it makes cool noises. It's an extremely versatile instrument, being used in both classical music, jazz music, and it even pops up (no pun intended) in rock & pop music from time to time, such as in [Van Halen's Big Bad Bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RPx6A3gKiA), or [Radiohead's Life in a GlassHouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKrAPSootn4). You may also know it from the one, the only, [the Monster's Inc theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOCc8D2rbkQ). Maybe you've seen videos like [this](https://redd.it/hbdpxr) on the front page, of great clarinettists absolutely shredding it. These examples are all in a fairly jazzy context, but [it's also very expressive in a classical environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS8hk0kL2sE&t=2840s).

Point is, it's got a dope sound. Now back to the sub. From the sidebar:

>Feel totally free to post any cool links of clarinet music or videos as well. We love clarinet music and clarinet performers here!

Which pretty much explains it all really, it's a pretty relaxed sub, as a hobby sub should be. You can post your own playing and get feedback, you can post your favourite performances from around the internet. The moderation is generally pretty lax, which is a nice change from the occasionally draconian moderation that can be found on Reddit. In my experiences on /r/Clarinet, the community is nothing short of exemplar. They're helpful, kind, and supportive, whether you're a complete beginner or have just started playing. This subreddit is a gold standard of what an ""education"" sub should be. If you wish to learn clarinet in any amount, this subreddit will provide all the assistance you could ask for over the internet (an irl teacher is still superior but that's a whole other conversation).

**1,280,148** Musicians *practicing* for **12 years**!

&nbsp;

There's a lot that could be said about classical music. Like, a *lot*. The term classical music is extraordinarily broad. I mean, it essentially encompasses 400 years of Western music. That's why I really don't think there's anyone out there who can say they *dislike* it. In a genre as encompassing as this, there'll always be something for everyone.

Anyways, rambling aside, this feature is the beginning of a full week of commemoration. **From today until the 17th, /r/SubredditoftheDay will be featuring a subreddit related to Western Classical Music each day.** For the 17th is the 250th anniversary of one Ludwig Van Beethoven. If you've not heard of Beethoven, well shit, I don't know what to tell you. He's [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKl4T5BnhOA). He's also [this guy](https://youtu.be/ChygZLpJDNE?t=860), and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU), and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mVW8tgGY_w) (not his best work but y'know can't have your 8 year old dropping Hammerklavier can you). Ask literally anyone on the street to [name a classical musician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlCEmPF4-V0), and their answer probably be this guy or Mozart. It's hard to overstate the impact this guy had on western classical music. After Beethoven had hit the scene, classical music changed forever. Your symphonies went from being like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k16t0zdgeuI) to being like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNRxHyZDU-Q). Western music as a whole would be completely different today if it weren't for this man. Yes, even you kids with your ""dup step"" and ""electric music"" wouldn't have those without this angry looking deaf guy.

Onto the Subreddit of the Day, /r/ClassicalMusic. As I'm sure all of our sharp minded readers have figured out, it's a sub for all things classical music. To be technical, the sub is mostly about Western Art Music, Art Music being the catch all term for western music written with classical harmony and such (since it's a little confusing having both the Classical Era and the Classical Period). Whether it's discussing composers, specific pieces, looking at new classical works (""contemporary classical""), or just posting about your favourite piece, /r/ClassicalMusic is an excellent sub for all things classical music.

I spoke with the moderators of /r/ClassicalMusic, to get a little insight on the sub and their perspective of classical music in general. Here's a few words from them:

&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/Baroque--** I’ve always had a passion for classical music. Naturally, as soon as I created a Reddit account I began searching for a platform where I could interact with others that share the same interest. I stumbled across r/classicalmusic relatively quickly and immediately knew that I had found somewhere that I felt comfortable and welcomed. It wasn’t until a year later when the subreddit had reached the one million member milestone that I reached out to the mod team and inquired as to whether or not they were looking to take new mods onboard. As luck had it, they had just commenced a recruitment drive, I applied and was successful.


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/Baroque--** Moderating the sub mostly consists of performing basic moderation duties, such as clearing the queue, checking modmail and trawling posts to ensure that discussions are remaining civil. Other than these tasks, whenever we find a post that sits in a grey area, we often convene with the moderation team as a whole using Discord to discuss how we would like to proceed. We also occasionally provide spontaneous suggestions for amending rules that any one of us thinks needs to be adjusted, and are able to partake in interesting dialogues that strengthen our teamwork and working relationship.


> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/u/ConspicuousBassoon** I quite enjoy posts depicting important figures of classical music doing ordinary, human activities. Pictures of Debussy visiting a beach, Shostakovich sitting with a pig, Stravinsky posing by a piano, etc. I feel that these are instrumental (no pun intended) in showing non-classical listeners that classical figures, even the greats, are not some elite, pompous, exclusive group that you need a degree to appreciate. They are people, like you and me, and their music is just as accessible as their humanity. My personal favorite post of this type is ""Shostakovich posing with a kitten"" for two reasons. One, it's a kitten, how can I not love it? Two, Shostakovich looks like everybody's grandfather in that picture, further emphasizing the human side of legendary composers. I'm so glad that photo is one of the top of all time on the subreddit.

>>And also the post showing different composers' drawings of treble clefs. It makes me feel less insecure about my inability to write clefs.


> **4: What do you see for the future of classical music in the modern age? Do you think the works of Haydn, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, etc, still have a place in the popular music of today?**

>> **/u/number9muses** They can, and still do! Thanks to the internet, classical music is more accessible now than any other time in history. But people are still worried about the genre dying off (funny, people have been foreseeing the death of music since the 14th century. Those dang kids with their lutes and madrigals!). I think that the greatest barriers are 1) lack of exposure (I blame the education system for dismissing the arts as unimportant and the first to cut funding from) and 2) cultural attitudes and stereotypes against classical music. Too often I see classical music treated like a homework assignment. Or worse, from a vocal minority of people who look down their noses at others and seem to evoke the classical pantheon as a marker of their own ‘high’ status and intellect to ‘appreciate high culture’. These pretentious and old stereotypes make classical out to be something by and for elitists and so can’t be as exciting and enjoyable as other music. That is, classical is treated as the “culture” that sparks “counterculture”. I think that the good news is, over time, these kinds of assumptions about art and music have changed for the better. And I think that giving classical a new context (that is, not something you have to dress up and sit in silence at a theater to listen to) will continue to help people appreciate it more. Think of how much music is made popular because of films, TV, and video games. Even someone as ‘avant garde’ as Ligeti can be made mainstream through film (2001; A Space Odyssey / The Shining / Eyes Wide Shut). 


> **5: Who are some of your favourite classical composers?**

>> **/u/the_rite_of_lingling** I feel like I speak for nearly every classical listener when I say this is a hard question! There is so much variety under the umbrella term ‘classical music’ - it’s certainly not all relaxing piano - and it can include not just Western classical, but the classical music of so many cultures across the world, that it’s hard to pick favourites. I do think that people begin to gravitate towards particular areas in classical music though - I really like the music of Gustav Mahler - he was about in the late 1800s/early 1900s and wrote these huge, expansive orchestral works. They just contain so many different colours and moods and make me feel so many different things! I think it’s amazing how intimate he can make the music feel, even though there are often hundreds of people working together to play it. Another composer I’ve been discovering recently is Samuel Coleridge-Taylor - he was a British composer in the late 1800s too. I find his music to be somewhat lighter than Mahler’s and he is the composer that I turn to whenever I am in need of a mood boost. He wrote a fantastic **[clarinet quintet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-MV8LyP1DM)** (clarinet + 2 violins, viola and cello) that often gets overlooked but is very beautiful and makes me so utterly happy listening to it! I also adore his more popular cantata (piece for choir and orchestra) called [**‘Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast’**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxOaE9RBezA) which never fails to bring a smile to my face.


> **6: What are some classical pieces that you would recommend to people less familiar with the genre, or that you feel are ""must-listen""?**

>> **/u/number9muses** -- [**Rachmaninoff - Piano Concerto no. 2, mov. 1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_VCbnqbwwA) (the whole concerto is great, but I’ve always loved this opening movement. Throws you into a dramatic storm, has a beautiful melody cutting through it, has very “Russian” moments, as well as haunting orchestration near the end) [**Ravel - Une barque sur l’ocean, orchestral version**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1aISfH5Yus) (originally for piano, Ravel later orchestrated this piece and he creates a great sound-painting of the sea. Sometimes shimmering, sometimes murky, sometimes the waves crash and sometimes it is calm, and has a hint of melancholy and nostalgia) [**Mozart - Flute and Harp Concerto, mov. 2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hIRXX_7gME) (ok so this might be the most stereotypical “Mozart” piece that falls into the stereotype of his music being ‘pretty’ and ‘heavenly’, but it is genuinely gorgeous and the melodies speak for themselves) [**Stravinsky - The Rite of Spring**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP42C-4zL3w) (honestly, if you haven’t heard this before then you are missing out. This is one of the revolutionary pieces of music history. Nothing like this had been written before, and it is one of the main influencers of all music since it premiered in 1913. It’s raw, colorful, with multiple keys and rhythms happening at the same time, and despite how “unexpected” it can be, it feels natural and primordial) [**Chopin - Barcarolle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU21X-wmD0Q) (a gorgeous piano piece that starts off as a ‘simple’ song that slowly grows bigger and brighter until it has a kind of transcendent and luminous finale) [**Shostakovich - String Quartet no. 8, mov. 2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjvTTfbpWjY) (really you should listen to the whole quartet, but this specific movement is intense to the point of being a head-banger. In a way it feels closer to heavy metal than classical.) [**Bach - Prelude and Fugue in a minor, BWV 543**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfnkz1cFp8g) (while the [*“Toccata and Fugue”*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGKfqSJbeAg) is super famous, especially around Halloween, an even better gothic sounding organ piece is this rhapsodic prelude and fugue that makes me feel like I’m in a haunted castle) [**Debussy - Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnz4T33Jl7I) (an unusual piece when it came out, but it perfectly captures the kind of dreamlike-imagery and language used in symbolist poetry. You follow the melody through different keys, unsure of where you are going, but not caring too much. It kind of does feel like laying under a tree on a warm summer afternoon) [**Beethoven - Symphony no. 7**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrm9jEo_Pk) (I feel like I can’t not include Beethoven, so here is my favorite of his symphonies. Let this blast from your speakers. It’s powerful, fun, dramatic, triumphant, all that)

> **7: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/the_rite_of_lingling** I think we will do more community events - we’ve had some opera streams and listening parties in the past, and they seem to have gone down well and it’s a nice way to reach out to people in the community, so we’ll be looking at hosting more of those. I think our plans for the sub just mainly include reaching as many people as possible. I genuinely believe there is a piece of classical music for everybody, no matter who you are or where you came from, and I think that the sub is a great tool for discovering and learning more about this amazing corner of art with lots of like-minded people. 

> **8: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/SuperBreakfast** I have had the pleasure of moderating r/classicalmusic for quite some time, and long before I entered that position, I would have been the first to tell you it’s absolutely my favorite corner of the internet. Moderating such a large community surely can be a difficult process at times, but I wouldn’t change it for the world. I am not a professional classical musician, so I haven’t had the pleasure of meeting many people who are as fascinated by the world of classical as I am. Being able to connect with others in something of a niche genre has been one of the best experiences of my life. I’m able to also utilize my skills as a historian, and I feel like moderating a community which receives a plethora of posts allows me the ability to constantly continue to learn and research. As a moderator, my team and I strive to keep content relevant to the subject matter, but we also try to keep the community engaged by doing listening events, which is always an exciting time. As time has propelled forth, it is becoming evident that this has grown from being my favorite part of the internet to becoming a substantial part of me. It’s not just a place where users can merely talk about classical music and listen together, but a place where we can all learn from one another, find inspiration, and much more

Don't worry, I get it. Maybe you don't own a system a game you care about is exclusive to, or the gameplay is much worse than the story, or you just want a refresher. I've been there. Instead of playing through the entire game and paying attention to the story every bit of the way, you can always just watch it. Y'know, like a movie.

/r/GamesTheMovie takes video game stories and puts them into long-form video format. They tell the entire story of a game or series, cutting down the gameplay and leaving cutscenes, important dialogue, and any other information relevant to the plot. I mentioned in the /r/HaloStory feature the other day that a [16-hour Halo movie exists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM-iAFVmlcI) in this format, and this is the subreddit I found it in. Most of the movies aren't anywhere near that long, but some don't seem long enough. [A Kingdom Hearts game in under 4 hours!?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamesTheMovie/comments/ja3aau/kingdom_hearts_15_remix_3_hours_45_minutes/) I need that much time just to figure out the premise of those games, let alone the plot itself.

Movies exist for most of my favorite games, but they definitely focus only on newer titles. You won't find, for instance, a Secret of Mana movie, and though some Final Fantasy games are adapted, it's only VI and onward. Thankfully, the subreddit does have a monthly request thread where you can ask someone with the time and talent to do so to make a game movie for a title you want, though there aren't usually many requests that I've seen. I don't think Viva Piñata: The Movie is getting made anytime soon, friends. It's a sad day for Piñata Island and therefore the world. :(

Anyway, it's a great resource for fans who want to remember what the hell happened in a game they've beaten ten times and forgotten due to lizard brain prioritization, or, well, any other reason, really. Maybe you just really like looking at the pretty cutscenes. They *are* pretty.

As a quick aside, the subreddit prominently links to a French companion subreddit, /r/FilmsDeJeux, but it's private. Maybe it's temporary, I don't know, but any French speakers out there with an interest may want to keep un oeil on it.

In the dark times, the newest Smash game was Brawl. The competitive scene was dominated by Meta Knight, rules were debated endlessly, and tournaments were in disarray, and when the world needed ScorpionMaster94 the most, he vanished. Brought to ruin by slow gameplay, random tripping, and SSS+ character dominance, the community looked upon the ruins of a mod known as Brawl+ and foresaw a light of hope in the form of Project M, an effort by dedicated fans to fix and revitalize a game they wanted desperately to be good.

Nowadays you've got SSB Ultimate and controversies around Nintendo continuing to be jackasses toward fans of their older games, such as by trying to stifle Slippi and netplay tournaments in Melee, but a certain group of fans isn't surprised at all. Project M has had a long, contentious history defined by its refusal to die when it was told to and its admirable tenacity in keeping a game alive against all odds. It's only right that we take a minute to acknowledge that perseverance. I won't go into the issues further, so if you're interested, just read the Project M page on SSBWiki. For a more general look at Smash's current issues with Nintendo, check out /r/SmashBros, the general series subreddit, for more information.

/r/SSBPM is the subreddit for Project M, and it's where fans of the game gather to post clips of people getting dunked on and where people who get dunked on ask for help improving. Much like a similar subreddit, /r/SSBM, which is for Melee, it's oriented around the game's more serious side, including the competitive community, but only due to the fervor of said people; it just as enthusiastically accepts new players who are eager to give the game a shot. Just be sure to [read the FAQ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/wiki/faqs) first, which answers most common questions, and you'll be well on your way.

If you're a fan of the Smash series and are looking for something new to play, give Project M a try. It's easy to get started, especially if you already have Melee set up on PC, or if you have a Wii and an SD card already, and easy to start playing. Plus, it's got Roy, Our Boy™, so you don't even have to think about what character to pick. If you do decide to branch out, though, every character is viable in different ways, so you never feel constrained to one or two if you don't want to use them. Personally, I like to just pick random to flex on people when I'm not up for the antics of my main. Still, it's up to you. Play how you want; that's just one good thing about Project M.

I *love* Halo. Buying the Xbox on release, along with Halo CE, DoA3, and something I can't even remember now, was the beginning of many awesome memories. I hadn't read 'Halo: The Fall of Reach' yet, because I didn't anticipate liking the game as much as I did, so all I had to go on was the game itself. It was awesome.

But, a game or two later, I did give them a read, back when there were (I think) three of them. The story was already awesome, but man, Fall of Reach brought it above and beyond. I distinctly remember reading about John and his team on their first mission to infiltrate a rebel base and kidnap the commander and thinking to myself, ""Well, this rocks."" If I'd known I'd be writing about that moment a decade and a half or so later I'd have tried to come up with something better.

Wouldn't you know it? There exists a subreddit for fans of the Halo story. It's aptly titled /r/HaloStory, and they're my kind of people. Now, I'm not as big a nerd as the people there who can remember the name of every Forerunner, Engineer, and Grunt, but I respect that. In my day, the Forerunners were mysterious and unseen, humans were a new race, and rampant Cortana simping was not only accepted, but encouraged. These issues, and many more, are the kind of things that crop up when you take a break from the series (and the series takes a break from PC), but the big brains at /r/HaloStory never left the Domain. Come see what they're all about, and if you're interested in the books and comics, [they've even got a nice reading order page for everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/Halo/wiki/literature). I also want to give a shout out to [this 16 hour video showing the majority of Halo's visual story, called Halo: The Complete Saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM-iAFVmlcI), which is an example of the kind of content you'd find on /r/GamesTheMovie, which is pretty cool, too.

Give it a watch if you have nothing else to do for an entire day, then come talk to me about why Dr. Halsey is the MVP of the Human-Covenant War, and that if not for her, Earth would be a lifeless, glassy rock.

Do you sometimes have a bit too much faith in humanity? Feeling positive about the world and the direction it's going in, even in the year of our lord 2020? Do you want to ruin your own day by exposing yourself to the worst this site has to offer? Well, do I have a subreddit for you!  
  
/r/WorstOf is what it says on the tin, it is the worst of Reddit. This subreddit has led me to the worst corners of this site, like [a COVID denial subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/jvvi06/uanalprolapsev1_describes_nursing_homes_on_a/) (cringe), [the ProtectAndServe pro-cop subreddit saying it's not the police's job to protect and serve autistic people](https://np.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/ixlmfd/rprotectandserve_explains_how_autistic_people/) (mega cringe), and [outright Holocaust denial on the Tucker Carlson subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/ins23t/outright_holocaust_denial_on_rtucker_carlson/) (holy shit). Those are the three worst posts on I could find on the subreddit from the last few months, but a great thing about this subreddit is that by sorting by top of all time, it reveals some of [the worst of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/39e7yr/the_worst_of_reddit_today_is_all_of_reddit/)... from the past!  
  
In [this classic post from 7 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/15yl38/ratheism_user_creates_quote_in_this_moment_i_am/), an r/atheism user created the quote, ""In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god's blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence."" r/cringe then decided to repost it to r/atheism pretending it was a Neil Degrasse Tyson quote. It, of course, then got upvoted to the front page. [This post from 3 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/665rv4/this_reddit_admins_response_to_such_an_extreme/) is just worrying - an openly racist and sexist call for murder being okayed by a Reddit admin. In [this post from 4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/5cvhg8/raltright_is_subreddit_of_the_day_a_selfdescribed/), it described how /r/SubredditOfTheDay declared /r/AltRight... as subreddit of the day... uhhhhhhhh....   
  
Yeah. [Not one of our proudest moments](https://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU). Guess we've all got a bit of /r/WorstOf in us.  
  
To sum up, as I stated before, this subreddit more than anything just makes me feel bad about humanity. However, to flip it on its head and attempt to spin this into an optimistic post, it's good that these terrible posts aren't going completely unchecked. These aren't just people in an echo-chamber nor are they a majority; /r/WorstOf exists to chronicle the bad side of reddit, but more than that it shows that no matter what some fascists or conspiracy theorists get up to in their own small bubbles, there are always people to make fun of them for the batshit positions they hold.

>> **u/dewlanpls** Of course not I don't have a death wish  

>> **u/RZYao** No, I haven't been to there, nor do I believe it's possible.

> #Do you know anyone from Wyoming?  

>> **u/WyattBrisbane** Personally, no  

>> **u/dewlanpls** No I prefer friends who aren't tied to the government  

>> **u/RZYao** As far as I know, they don't exist.  

> ‎‎
> #What do you say to those who have been to Wyoming?  

>> **u/WyattBrisbane** They haven't been there, the moment they got too close they were captured by government agents and brainwashed into thinking that's where they went, then sent on there way  

>> **u/dewlanpls** Why do you crave attention so much that you would risk all of our lives by lying about such a thing?  

>> **u/RZYao** It's all a simulation from the moment they cross the border.  

> ‎‎
> #Why do you think so many people are subscribed to /r/WyomingDoesntExist?  

>> **u/WyattBrisbane** People can see through the lies and found a group of like-minded people  

>> **u/dewlanpls** More and more, people want to know the truth about the world and this is arguably the biggest secret out there.  

>> **u/RZYao** They either have found the truth, or are interested in learning about it.  

> ‎‎
> #To sum up, does Wyoming exist?  

>> **u/WyattBrisbane** Nope  

>> **u/dewlanpls** Absolutely not

https://www.reddit.com/r/iagreewithmyhusband/comments/968zfz/the_post_that_started_it_all/  
  
The above link is the post that started it all. No, not just started the subreddit. It was around before the creation of Reddit, before the creation of the internet, before the creation of humanity, before creation itself. This meme was the origin point of everything, and it started it all. It set everything in motion - it truly is the post that started it all. 
  
Sorry, I got carried away there. My brain is a bit tired, but can you really blame me? Try reading through the [top posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/iagreewithmyhusband/top/?sort=top&t=all) on /r/iagreewithmyhusband for an extended period of time. It's not exactly a bad experience, in fact I'd recommend it, but it does not do wonders for your brain cells. To put it simply, this is a subreddit revolving around variations of one relatively obscure meme from over 2 years ago - ""I agree with my husband"". The original is linked above, and somehow this became a format popular enough to warrant its own subreddit with 10k+ subscribers. I'm glad it did, because when this subreddit hits it hits hard. My favourite posts include:  
  
* [""Everyone is in agreement""](https://www.reddit.com/r/iagreewithmyhusband/comments/9696x9/everyone_is_in_agreement/), a very wholesome post depicting a happy relationship :)  
  
* [""Discouraging Wife""](https://www.reddit.com/r/iagreewithmyhusband/comments/9bk5h4/discouraging_wife/), a not wholesome post depicting a less than happy relationship :(  
  
* [""The True Truth""](https://www.reddit.com/r/iagreewithmyhusband/comments/96ch3v/the_true_truth/), a 2-year-old post predicting that the meme would die within a week.  
  
That last post isn't entirely wrong, but it's not completely accurate either. The subreddit carries on, getting hundreds of upvotes a month on posts such as [this great Among Us-themed one](https://www.reddit.com/r/iagreewithmyhusband/comments/iu8w2r/idk_green_kinda_sus/). Moral of the story? I guess it's that older meme formats are still great. So if you'll excuse me, I'm off to watch some [leekspin](https://leekspin.com/).

I fucking love /r/copypasta. There is nothing bad, nor could there ever be anything bad about /r/copypasta. For those who don't know, ""copypasta"" is defined as ""a block of text which is repeatedly copied and pasted by individuals over various online forums and social media sites"", such as [Reddit.](https://i.redd.it/18qmo596hl841.jpg)  
  
The ability to copy and paste has given power to users for decades. Writing an assignment the night before it's due, on a subject you have no knowledge about? Easy - copy and paste from Wikipedia! Losing an argument with someone online? Then just copy and paste a long elaborate insult from /r/copypasta. Copypasta comes in all shapes and sizes. There's the [short pasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/jyrnig/if_you_watch_spiderman_2002_in_reverse_its_about/), the [long pasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/k1dukh/a_giant_list_of_puns/), even the [medium pasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/k20dgu/i_need_a_femboy/). All pasta is welcome. I personally love taking the funny medium-sized ones, such as [""The ending of the WWII is AWFUL""](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/k03b3i/the_ending_of_the_wwii_is_awful/), and copy and pasting them into group chats, where they assume I've written it out and leave me on seen in pure awe of my autism. Of course, they don't know that I'm actually not that funny.  
  
The classic pasta, the creme de la creme, the tour de force, the magnum opus, is of course the Navy Seal copypasta. If you are unfortunate enough to not be aware of this classic pasta, it goes as follows:  
  
\*ahem\*
  
>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.   
  
  
  

Yeah. Amazing, right? That about wraps up today's feature, please share your favourite copypastas in the comments and remember to like and subscribe (and hit that bell icon)!

Dogue is a subreddit that is focused on high fashion/style magazine cover edits! We carefully moderate the subreddit to maintain a high quality, OC centered approach to submissions.

We have recently decided to expand our rules to allow cats in a special magazine called CQ (Cats Quarterly). Otherwise all covers must be of Dogs and say *Dogue*!

We have only a few rules:

1. Dogs and cats only!
2. Covers must be in the style of Vogue.
3. No request posts. Requests must be made in the stickied thread.
4. OC only. Reposts from this sub and images from the web are not allowed.

To encourage new posts we have tips & tricks in the sidebar, including photoshop templates to help you get started!

No. This is not a satire.

No. We are not trolls.

No. We are not joking.

Decades ago, an evil rose from the shadows, invading every home of every christian American family. It shattered our good and healthy ways to live, ruthlessly dragging the young folk to an abbyss of filth, addiction and degeneration. Disguising itself as entertainment, this evil finally showed its fangs, painted by innocent blood.

This evil is called video games.

For as long as I can remember, my local radio station has accepted listener submissions in the form of three song “sets”. Over the years, I have found some of my favorite music thanks to this format. I wanted to share this with as many people as possible, so I created /r/SelectASet.

Members of r/SelectASet can share music with each other in the form of three song sets. Each set must follow a theme, as specified by the author. This idea has been AWESOME so far thanks to the over 800 members who have joined in our first month. I can’t wait to see where everyone takes it with their creativity and support for one another.

We’ve also been holding weekly contests. Each week, members submit sets that fall under a specified theme. This has created a lot of community investment and involvement. Some past themes are “covers that are better than the original song” and “songs I wish I could hear for the first time again”.

Anyone looking to find or share some dope new music should absolutely come see what we’re all about!

Welcome to r/ItsSnowingOnMtFuji, this subreddit is surprisingly about haikus, but not just any haikus, really weird haikus. Let me explain.

r/ItsSnowingOnMtFuji is named after a video from GameGrumps where they were making really bad haikus, and ending each haiku with ""Its Snowing On Mt. Fuji"", which since that has too many syllabals, it made it not a haiku, but eh, close enough.

And ""eh, close enough"" is prettymuch our motto at r/ItsSnowingOnMtFuji. Is your haiku a few syllabals off? Who cares. Is it about a really strange topic that people will judge you for in the real world? We wont. Is there a funny haiku you made that people will hopefully think is funny but you are too scared to tell it to anyone you know because you are a weird outcast that nobody pays attention to? We can help with the haiku part, just not the rest. And that is why you should join r/ItsSnowingOnMtFuji

&nbsp;

Internet chess has had an interesting few months. We went from being a fairly conserved group on the web with no drama, to being practically full on mainstream in Twitch culture in about 12 weeks, which brought many of the... Traits of Twitch culture along with it. I would say that this whole thing took off when famous streamer [xQc](https://www.twitch.tv/xqcow) started learning chess alongside Hikaru Nakamura, one of the strongest chess players in the world and also an avid streamer. Imagine explaining that to the grandmasters of 50 years ago. Since then it's blown up, with [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) (bad) hosting a tournament in which many super popular Twitch streamers are playing in. Even the fucking *chess world champion* is somewhat involved in chess streaming these days. It's fair to say that chess has had an enormous surge in popularity over the past year, this is probably the most popular it's been since the 50's. [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) (bad) and [Lichess](https://www.lichess.org) (good) both have massive userbases, no doubt related to the quarantine, and [Chess24](https://www.chess24.com) (lmao no) has countless grandmasters streaming and commentating on games.



However, through all of this new wave of popularity, and the endless drama and dumbfuckery it brought along with it (I wrote this feature a few months ago and I've had to delete like 3 paragraphs because they were referencing outdated drama), one thing has stood tall above all others, one thing bringing communities together. Memes. /r/Chess doesn't allow memes, ~~or fun~~ (**UPDATE**: Since writing this feature a few months ago, /r/chess now allows a little bit of fun). Hence why /r/AnarchyChess exists. It's a sub that excels in making original chess memes, unoriginal chess memes (guys 2.Ke2, laugh now), and mocking the everloving shit of every front page /r/chess post (so much so that there's even a bot specifically for telling you what /r/chess post each AChess post is parodying).


&nbsp;


Here are a few of my personal favourite posts on the sub, in no particular order:

This is a completely SFW subreddit about fans! It's about the fans that spin, the fans that cool, and the fans that circulate air. 

We also love [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyFans/comments/ir2rre/but_for_real_what_is_it) about fans. 

It is a heavily moderated community so that you guys don't see stuff that isn't about fans. I hope you all like it!



r/OnlyFans is, as the name suggests, a subreddit only about fans. We are of course referring to the spinning fans, otherwise known as contraptions with rotating blades that create currents of air for cooling or ventilation. The only exception to this rule is hand fans, which do not have blades and are not rotating but they do blow air and are called fans.

So is it just a boring sub about fans? Not really. r/OnlyFans is as much about fans as it is about memes and jokes about them. Since the subreddit is called how it is called, you can imagine what a lot of jokes are about.

That being said, if you bought a new fan, own some nice pc coolers, or just want to show us some proper blowing action, you’re more than welcome to do so! What are you waiting for? Take a seat and enjoy the breeze!

This is a small community where people can discuss and debate almost any topic they want. Relationship advice, politics, games, music, movies, and anything else you can think of. The opinions of the subscribers are diverse and civility is strictly enforced.

As long as your topic appropriately asks a question or generates a discussion, it is welcome in the sub.



Discussion is a community of people just looking talk about anything that’s on their mind. Sports, politics, pop culture, games...anything is welcome in the sub. This is a sub where civility matters. It’s a mix of anything, and a place where users want to avoid the larger subreddits because a smaller community of users with diverse opinion appeal to them.

Civility is strictly enforced and trolls are not welcome, so users won’t have to worry about their opinions being called “stupid.” A diversity of viewpoints is heavily encouraged in this sub. Discussion is like a virtual pub, so grab a virtual drink and talk about anything that’s on your mind!

A subreddit where users can find support after they have ended a friendship, whether of their own accord or someone else's. If they miss their former friend, get angry just thinking about them or just want to feel less alone, we're here for them and ready to support and listen. 





 It's a subreddit where users can talk about how their friendship ended and receive support and encouragement from others going through the same thing. There are plenty of video essays and articles on the emotions involved with losing a friend, but these same tools remind us that there are ways to cope and deal with one's new sense of what's normal. 

Whether it's grief, anger, indifference, numbness or what have you, having a falling out with a friend hurts and makes you feel more alone. This sub reminds users that they're not alone in this, creating a safe space for anyone to talk about what's on their mind. The mod team personally comments on posts, invites users and communicates with users in private if they need additional encouragement.

/r/slotcars is for everything related to the great, long-lasting hobby of slot car racing. Old cars, new cars, great tracks, news, features, and everything else pertaining to the sport of getting a small toy car around a circuit the fastest.

For a long time slot car fans tended to be older dads and grandpas, but as things got less expensive and more available, younger people have gotten into slot cars. The hobby has been around a long time, and has been on life support on and off over the years, but not anymore. 

/r/slotcars has a lot of stuff. We post news about upcoming cars and tracks, people post pics of their layouts, some [small](https://www.reddit.com/r/slotcars/comments/igr0qg/pulled_this_old_aurora_kit_out_of_some_old_boxes/), some [large](https://www.reddit.com/r/slotcars/comments/imgxub/temporary_garage_track/). One redditor posted pics of a layout he made during the lockdown entirely [out of cardboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/slotcars/comments/hn186q/update_corona_canyon_details_in_comments/). Another made his layout on an [old door](https://www.reddit.com/r/slotcars/comments/hf4ncg/my_4lane_hollow_core_door_figure8_layout_speed/). Here's another really nice  [quarantine track project](https://www.reddit.com/r/slotcars/comments/hcmop8/dads_quarantine_project_looks_like_hes_been/). 

Some people build [really sweet street racers](https://www.reddit.com/r/slotcars/comments/i9gmfw/ready_for_some_drag_racing/), some collect great [race cars of the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/slotcars/comments/f8ftym/some_1970s_f32s_including_a_chuck_palmer_and_a/). We all share a love of slot cars and have a pretty great little community going on at /r/slotcars.

**3.8k** members for **10 years!**

During my time on Reddit, I've found that there is more interest in language than I ever could have guessed. It's amazing how many people I've connected with who subscribe to three or four language communities, newsletter, or services, yet are still looking for something else.

To help address the needs of our fellow Redditors we decided to reopen the [r/LearnANewLanguage](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnANewLanguage) subreddit. Our goal is to make this subreddit the place on the internet for language crowdsourcing. But, to be honest, it's really up to the community members to decide our future.

We recently started a daily vocabulary quiz using crowdsourced translations and we are asking our community members to pitch new crowdsourcing projects. Thank you for your support and welcome to our community!

**308** readers for **8 years!**





My subreddit is pretty much what is sounds like. Almost every day (I don't posts on weekends or holidays) I make a post about a certain car. It can be anything from a 1993 Geo Prizm to a Ferrari 458. 



r/caroftheday - basically exactly what it sounds like. Old cars, new cars, great cars, awful cars; r/caroftheday is a small community dedicated to cars in general. Almost every day I make a post about a particular car. Sometimes it's an exotic supercar, and sometimes it's a 64 horsepower Lada 2107. I include a wide variety of cars in my posts, and I also like to include plenty of information about the particular car I'm posting about. All subreddit members are allowed to make their own COTD posts if they want to. 

The subreddit has been around for about 8 years. It had 60 members when I took over last November. I made a few posts, gave up for a while, and have decided to continue my efforts to revive the subreddit. We currently have 304 members, a number that has slowly risen over the past several months.

When you hear the word ""gambling"", you might first think about a lot of cash, huge piles of poker chips, slot machines, betting, Las Vegas, and large risks. Of course, a ton of websites and video games exist that offer you a money-free gambling game with in-game currency. Or, you could visit r/1through10.



r/1through10 is a subreddit for guessing the correct number between 1 and 10. You simply post your guess in the title, and the moderator will soon tell you were your guess correct or not with a random number generator. Did you lose? You'll get a one day ban from the subreddit and your post will most likely be downvoted by the community. Did you win? You'll get your post most likely upvoted by the community and you can try your luck and guess one more time!



r/1through10 is simple and safe. The gambling method is easy to understand and run, and the only currency you are going around is your Reddit karma. The subreddit also hosts special events occasionally, such as a larger range of guess-able numbers, and special prizes, including unique user flairs or Reddit Awards. Hop in, good luck!

**30,373** Gary lovers for **1 year!**

Do you have a cat? I do, and I absolutely love them. They might not be as sociable as dogs, but they still manage to make me relaxed when I'm around them. In fact, cats can help your body to release dopamine and serotonin, which reduces stress, according to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intimacy-path-toward-spirituality/201507/if-you-love-cats-may-be-why). Cats also can help you to release oxytocin, which is linked with the feelings of getting in love.

I have 2 cats, Miina and Poju. They are siblings and have been with us since they bornt. They play with each other a lot, however, all of this happens when I'm already going to sleep. They are taking naps all day and then keeping me awake by running around the house and making a huge hullabaloo. But how's Gary doing?

Gary is a 6-year-old domestic long-haired cat. He was rescued by the Calgary Humane Society after being found with a broken hip. The shelter performed a femoral head ostectomy (removing the head of his femur) and put him up for adoption. Gary's mom saw that he had the same injury at the same age as his now-brother Duke (an 8-year-old Lab/Newfoundland mix) and knew they needed to live together. They've been brothers for almost five years!

r/Gary_The_Cat is for archiving the adventures of Gary from their Instagram account with over 233 000 followers. Gary does a lot of different kinds of activities; From playing (or fighting) with his dog pal Marge, to hiking in beautiful, postcard photo-like places. Gary especially likes to take a nap on the front of the boat meanwhile the owners of Gary are paddling. He is also taught to walk on a leash. They started slowly on the training, and they would have just sat together for a few minutes before going back in. As Gary got more comfortable being on a leash, they slowly started to lengthen their walks - from just wandering around the yard, then taking walks in a park, and later starting to actually hike. And here we are!

However, you should know when and how you should start to train your cat being on a leash. Here are some tips from Gary's FAQ:

> It’s important to make harness training a positive experience for your cat. Make sure you provide positive reinforcement (i.e .treats), especially when you’re starting out. You don’t need to start harness training as a kitten. We started with Gary when he was already four years old. In less than a year we’ve made huge progress in what he’s comfortable with.

Gary definitely is one of my favorite cats online. I also really enjoy the photos they're taking, they're really beautiful! You definitely should check this subreddit if you're in love with cats, or beautiful landscapes. Or both!

**366,400** *droplets* for **7 years**!

&nbsp;

/r/Raining is quite self-explanatory. It's a sub for posting anything and everything related to rain. 

Perhaps I'm biased, being from Ireland, but I think rain is just the nicest weather, or it least, when the rain isn't fucking bucketing down for days on end, it certainly can be. Too much sun is just not fun for anyone, it gets too hot, my uber pale ass gets sunburned, the potatoes die, etc, etc. Rain though, rain is cool. Both literally and figuratively. It's easy to warm up when you're cold but it's very hard to cool down when you're warm (writing this from a 24 degree humid as fuck non air conditioned room btw, send help), so in sunny weather us poor folks in the jet stream are cursed to spend hours, if not days sitting in unbearably hot, humid non air conditioned hellholes. Rain, on the other hand, makes everything nicer. It's what keeps everything looking nice when the sun is out. It's nice to sleep in. It's got the **A E S T H E T I C** vibe to it sometimes, it's just the all round better weather. It's the meteorological equivalent of a [minor seventh chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minor_seventh_chord_on_C.mid).

 Nobody really likes being stuck in the rain, but we certainly like looking at it. If you're looking for nice pictures of rain, or art depicting rain, or pretty much anything else related to it, this is the sub to go to.

There's tons of really nice aesthetic content on the sub, ranging from [pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8k9rrq/this_japanese_restaurant_during_last_nights_storm/) to [drawings](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/9eznry/someone_suggested_i_post_my_drawing_of_this_rainy/) and [paintings](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/d3uqfc/i_painted_my_rainy_street_at_night/) and [images where I honestly can't really tell if it's real or not because of how cool it looks](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8mv3tl/it_rained_so_hard_the_city_became_like_blade/). There are also [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/cythti/cant_wait/), because this is Reddit.

This is the sub's 3rd time on /r/SubredditoftheDay, [being featured last in 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/a1h4qi/november_29th_2018_rraining_some_people_feel_the/). However, I feel like with the quality of the sub, it deserves the extra recognition. They've grown by 100,000 subscribers since the last feature and I hope they continue to grow from here.

Overall I think this is just an excellent sub for anyone who likes looking at nice pictures and occasionally nice memes. I highly recommend looking through it on on a sunny day when there's nothing to do and no reason to go outside.

New Patriotism is the dedication to the positive values, ethics, and principles that rightly inspire pride in the nations that embodies them. It is a place for people who value a devotion to the principles of democracy, and seek to hold their leaders to standards that will make them proud. New Patriotism is about loving Freedom, Courage, Liberty, Compassion, and your fellow citizens. Nationalism means standing behind your country even as it does wrong, Patriotism is about standing behind your country to drive it to do what is right.  
  
/r/NewPatriotism is a subreddit dedicated to sharing stories about the people who embody those values, and writing that illuminates why those values are important, as well as a place for people who are off-put by the right-wing conception of (pseudo) Patriotism - the type of ""Patriotism"" used to promote agendas that are not Patriotic. A go-to examples being the phrase ""Support the Troops"" being used to send troops to kill and die on foreign soil in unjust wars, using vast amounts of resources, while demonizing those who oppose the war as being ""against"" their country's military. And so, /r/NewPatriotism is also here to highlight examples of the Pseudo-Patriotism that exploits the concept of nation pride in order to further unPatriotic ideological agendas.

The sub responded with several hundred signatures adn strong desire to help. Small town police are over their heads and the family needs help solving it. Not a case popular with the media, it's a small town murder with motorcycle gangs, a popular local man, and his step daughter holding the smoking gun but saying it wasn't her fault. Read about how horrifying that night was with faces in the window, pounding on the door of an isolated home in the middle of the night,  blood on the driveway, a mysterious backpack, and so many interesting turns.

**2,003** subscribers, a subreddit for **3 years**!   
  
Malayalam cinema originated in the 1920s and has since flourished to now become the fourth-largest film industry in India, preceded only by Hindi (/r/bollywood), Tamil, and Telugu. Roughly 100 films are produced every year in Mollywood, as it is also sometimes called. It is known for realism, inventive cinematography, and colourful dance sequences in its films, which has put the southern Indian state of Kerala in the world map. Over the decades, several films have been presented at prestigious international festivals like Cannes, Venice, Biennale, and TIFF. While Shaji N Karun's Piravi (1989) won the Golden Palm, Adaminte Makan Abu (2011) saw itself sent to the Oscars, and most recently Moothon (2019) won several accolades at the international film festival circuit. India's first 3D film, My Dear Kuttichathan (1984), was also a Malayalam feature.  
   
Malayalam cinema is the arena of internationally noted personalities such as Adoor Gopalakrishnan, M T Vasudevan Nair, Mammootty, Mohanlal, and Resul Pookutty to name a few.  
  
/r/MalayalamMovies is a small way to appreciate the works of these personalities and engage in lively discussions involving new and old films, with a tinge of retrospection of the 1980s and 1990s which are arguably dubbed the golden periods of Malayalam cinema. Come, join us, and explore more of Malayalam-language films from a country that is the third largest film industry in the world.

**808** homebrewers for **6 Months**!

The r/Pathfinder2eCreations subreddit is a fairly new but active community of creators and players who work together on homebrew (custom) designs to be used in Pathfinder 2e. For those that don't know, Pathfinder is a tabletop RPG akin to D&D, in fact descended from an earlier version. Pathfinder 2e is the second edition of this game, which released about a year ago. Pathfinder is the number two most popular and best selling TTRPG behind D&D, with the second edition growing rapidly in its fanbase as more content is released. Our subreddit provides a place for designers to release their content into the world, for gamemasters to find new content, and for players to learn more about the game they love.

The subreddit was founded about 6 months ago and boasts ~800 users at the time of writing. Our users are active, averaging 300 page views and several new submissions each day. We have weekly pinned threads to encourage users to submit new ideas for others to design, and are in the process of planning competitions and contests for various designs. In addition, our users provide invaluable insight and feedback on designs. This allows the creators to produce content more inline with the player's needs and up to a level of quality that, considering it is given away for free, is quite impressive.

Some examples of our the quality content produced in our sub include [a complete, 28-page rule set](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2eCreations/comments/hybwao/warship_and_airship_combat_for_2e_playtest_release/) on using ships within the game, a [series](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2eCreations/comments/hasbm7/magus_thesis_war_priest_version_of_wizards/) of [refinements](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2eCreations/comments/hbdgmw/magus_thesis_v2_the_updated_version_of_a_gish/) for a [custom](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2eCreations/comments/hdrze1/magus_v3_now_a_class_archetype_for_sorcerers_and/) [class](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2eCreations/comments/hf1149/magus_v4_gish_class_archetype_for_sorcerers_and/) (there is more, I can't fit it all), and [full length adventures](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2eCreations/comments/hm83nq/creation_of_the_day_chapter_one_of_a_three/). As you can see our users are rather dedicated and passionate about this game, and about sharing their love with others. Often in the form of horrible monsters.

**7,237** subscribers, a subreddit for **3 months**!  
  
/r/stupidloopholes is a subreddit for loopholes that are weird, crazy, or just plain stupid. Loopholes occur when the law is just ambiguous enough to bend, but not break. This subreddit is for loopholes that, logically, should not work, but they do anyway.  
  
This sub started with posts that were about businesses that used creative, but dumb techniques to sell products that were technically not legal. It quickly evolved into a place to share all loopholes which sound so stupid that they might just work.  
  
We feature articles that show people using creative loopholes to game the system, or sometimes the other way around. When somebody figures out a way to pull one over on the government or a large company, it is something that we can all admire. And while It is always nice to root for the underdog, sometimes the big guy screws with the little guy in such a way that you can’t help but be impressed.  
  
Much of our content is serious in nature, but there are many posts that have been funny, sad, or even scary. We also allow memes to be posted on the weekends, so there are definitely some laughs to be had as well. Thanks for reading, I hope to see you all over at /r/stupidloopholes.

**148,719** tankers for  **9 Years!** 

One of those SFW ""porn"" subreddits, /r/TankPorn is a subreddit for tank enthusiasts! Although according to the sidebar, it is for all things *""Battle Tanks, Armored Fighting Vehicles, Armored Cars, Self-Propelled Guns and Support Vehicles affiliated""*. Ranging from the earliest armored vehicles, modern day prototypes, and even to futuristic designs, if someone can argue that it's a tank, it's welcome!

Ever since news spread of the usage of tanks on the battlefields of the Great War, people became fascinated by them. They became so popular that British National War Savings Committee started using them to sell bonds, creating [**Tank Banks**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/gallery_tank_04.shtml). So with such a strong historical precedent, it's no surprise that has large community on reddit!

I ~~recently~~ talked with some of the moderators of /r/TankPorn to ask them a few questions about their subreddit!

^(Answers edited for formatting purposes)

>#1. Why did you start/join the subreddit?  

>>**/u/zach9889**  I've always had a passion for military equipment, so I started this community for folks with similar interests to share cool photos and foster technical discussion. Things didn't really take off until after Ethan and the rest of the gang joined as a mod, each bringing something different and valuable to the table.

>>**/u/MaxRavenclaw**  I like tanks. I subscribed to the sub to both see cool tank pics and find out more about them. I noticed the flairs could be improved. I offered to do that and my offer was accepted. The current flairs are my creation for the most part (based on images from Tanks Encyclopedia, and others). After that, I did the usual mod duties. As with most subs I mod, I mostly focus on the CSS. But I'm proud to be part of the mod team of one of my favourite subs. It's an honour.

>>**/u/KapitanKurt**   I've held an interest in military history since I was a young man so this and other subreddits help fulfill that. When I received the invitation to help moderate r/TankPorn a few years ago, I jumped at the chance. If you ever have the chance to climb into a tank, like at a museum or such, I recommend you give it a try.

>#2. What's moderating the sub like?  

>>**/u/zach9889**  To be honest, for me it is easy. I check the mod queue and keep tabs on any reports or potential direction changes with the sub. The rest of the mod team does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to formatting, for which I'm grateful for, otherwise the place would look and hum along nearly as well.

>>**/u/MaxRavenclaw**  Easier and pleasanter than even /r/DerScheisser. I swear, /r/TankPorn has to have one of the best communities I've had to deal with when it comes to drama. There's basically no drama to be found here. Compared to modding some of my other subs, it's a pleasure to go through the mod queue here.

>>**/u/KapitanKurt**  It's fairly easy and zen when compared to other subreddits that I moderate as there's not a lot of drama. Our group of moderators work well together.

>#3. What are some of your favourite posts?  

>>**/u/zach9889**  My favorite [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/dtkgcg/a_few_weeks_ago_i_asked_for_you_all_to_name_my/) was from late last year when /u/Sheo1812
 came to the sub and asked the community to help him name his tank, which became the beautiful ""Karen"".

>>**/u/MaxRavenclaw**  Cool pics are the main theme of the sub, and I love them, but if I also love the discussions that happen in the comments. Honourable mention to those. The question says posts, though, so without further ado: [Old vs New](https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/ahhsng/the_time_is_now_old_man/) for highlighting the evolution of tanks in a single image, and [Wittmann's Tiger](https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/enu8dh/the_tiger_1_that_michael_wittman_and_his_crew/) for showing that no tank is invulnerable.

>>**/u/KapitanKurt**  There are so many. Here's some examples:

>> - [Tanks Firing on Exercise Iron spear 2019. Shot from the commanders hatch of a CR2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/erthlk/tanks_firing_on_exercise_iron_spear_2019_shot/)

>> - [Tank people vs. normal people](https://old.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/6e6khp/tank_people_vs_normal_people/)

>> - [Jagdpanther Maybach Engine Sound](https://old.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/emf5kd/jagdpanther_maybach_engine_sound/)

>#4. What are your plans for the sub in the future?  

>>**/u/zach9889**  As long as this community remains a forum that fosters the quality content and discussion that it's founding is based upon, I'll be satisfied.

>>**/u/MaxRavenclaw**  Hopefully, get to adding more flairs already. I've been planning to do that for quite a while, but I never seem to find the time, patience, and energy for it.

>>**/u/KapitanKurt**  We fortunate to continue our growth having surpassed 100K users a few months back. That was a noteworthy milestone for us. Last year, we created a sister subreddit called r/TankPornMemes as a safety valve for those tankers who like to blow off a little steam and have some fun. We try innovative and creative things to hold user's interests such as having custom tank flairs available. We added era-specific submission flairs. Max does that formatting work for us for which we contribute ideas, etc.

>#5. Anything else you want to add?  

>>**/u/zach9889**  Can't stress enough how much the other mods have helped this sub grow and thrive with their technical and subject matter expertise.

>>**/u/MaxRavenclaw**  Thank you for covering us, and thank you to our community members and my fellow mods for making this sub great. Cheers!

>>**/u/KapitanKurt**  Only to say thank you for the opportunity to showcase our sub.

[r/engrish](https://www.reddit.com/r/engrish) a Subreddit dedicated subreddit for phucked up speeling mistks and grammar that wierd is. Plus all the things inbetween like plain phucked up text. The premise is that you submit anything that was poorly written, or as the sidebar says, ""an engrish phuck-up"". I was intrigued because of all the hilarious content that makes it onto that subreddit. It made me want to improve my grammar and spelling, as you can tell I'm a work in progress.

In this subreddit, you can find anything from a poorly made translation to a bad grammatical effort from someone who speaks English. The funny part is that these kinds of events are quite common in real life, so the subreddit is always filling up with interesting content. The moderators have done a great job in growing the subreddit into a brilliant community that barely needs moderation at all.

Howdy, y'all. I didn't create Wild West Pics; I just discovered it as a dead sub with no new pics in 2 years. I helped to revive it Spring of 2020. I fell in love with it, & have been there every day since.  

We like to see wild western historical/vintage pictures including, but not limited to: cowboys, American Indians, farming, outlaws, loggers, miners, vaqueros, rednecks, roughnecks, ranchers, hunters, and/or everyday life in the country.  

Wanna make a submission? Please include **location/date**, if known in the caption of the post. Sources preferred, but not required. Have a brief history or interesting fact of object or person in picture. If you got it, flaunt it, as they say. **NSFW** tags on executions, assassinations, dead or dying humans, dead or dying animals.

This is a Wiki to general guidelines I keep in mind for good submissions:
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier  
    
>1850–1924 (myth of the Old West). The heart & soul of the American Wild West & this subreddit.  
  
But the fun thing about regions & history - it's like a spider web. Connections influence the wild west even across borders. Usually I'd like to keep this sub contained to the USA, usually pre-1940s. But hay, we got plenty of Métis on both sides of our border with Canada. And Pancho Villa was crossing the Mexican border to raid Columbus, NM. So, southern Canada + northern Mexican history pictures are okay & welcomed so long as it feels like it fits into the wild west theme.

You can only use six words ......

To create a somewhat interesting story.

Now for a six question interview


>#1. Why'd you start/join the subreddit?
    
>>**energytheif** ""For adoption: Abandoned subreddit, barely moderated.""

Now for the longer answer: 9 years ago I stumbled across the subreddit after reading about the story reportedly written by Ernest Hemingway that is claimed to have been his favorite story: ""For sale: baby shoes, never worn."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_sale:_baby_shoes,_never_worn)

I was intrigued by how much story there really was in those six little words, arranged just so - there is mystery, tragedy, pathos. It's really an elegant story, wherever it came from. The subreddit was essentially empty, very little traffic, very few subscribers. After messaging u/passwordispassword3 - the creator and moderator at that time - and receiving no reply, I petitioned the admins and u/hueypriest granted me ownership. I began cross-promoting the site and grew it from a few hundred subscribers to over 58,000 where it is today.


>#2. What is moderating the sub like?

>>**energytheif** ""Takes a village to moderate here.""

Now for the longer answer: It's honestly pretty easy to moderate. Although it's pretty high volume, the community is quick to report violations. The most common reports have to do with attempts to be clever and skirt the rules by submitting five or seven word stories, and wrapping it in some meta logic. Although clever, we remove those posts really quick.

The team of u/jonusfatson, u/Hilltopchill, u/AlexAndertheAble and u/russxbox do a great job keeping the peace 'round these parts.


>#3. What're your favourite posts from r/sixwordstories?
    
>>**energytheif** ""I think, therefore I vote up.""

I really like posts that make me think twice, and tell a story about the human condition in some way. There are some really depressing stories, but lots of comedy, sci-fi, romance and other genres too! Here are some of my favorites:

-[Favourite 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/sixwordstories/comments/13ia3n/he_bottlefeeds_his_wifes_killer/)

-[Favourite 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/sixwordstories/comments/1vbdbt/the_smallest_coffins_are_the_heaviest/)

-[Favourite 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/sixwordstories/comments/3t2j8n/ai_pretends_to_fail_turing_test/)

The top voted post by far is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sixwordstories/comments/2b5y7c/trust_the_government_everything_is_fine/).

Not only did it bring attention to government censorship in the era of reddit's opposition to SOPA, it generated some of the most interest discussion I'd seen on the sub.

>#4. Will you make changes to the sub?
   
>>**energytheif** 

Obviously as a ""gimmick"" subreddit, we aren't planning to change the rules. We're planning to dust off a concept we used in the past, running some community contests around a theme. Some of the past contests have been great, for example https://www.reddit.com/r/sixwordstories/comments/pn0el/rsixwordstories_community_challenge_2_a_love_story/. I think we did about ten or eleven of these, and it's time to bring the concept back.

>#5.Anything else you want to add? 
    
>>**energytheif** ""I believe that limitations breed creativity.""

Thanks for the spotlight, I'm happy to have fostered a place where redditors can express their creativity and experiment with really-short-form writing. One thing to remember: The comments don't have to be six words - discussion is encouraged!

Check out the sidebar as well, some other great writing communities out there besides our own.

>#6. Why is it six words specifically?
    
>>**energytheif** 

Because of how much story there really are in those six little words, arranged just so - there is mystery, tragedy, pathos. It's really an elegant story, wherever it came from.

**7,792** subscribers, a subreddit for **5 years!**  

One of the highlights of being a writer for Subreddit of the Day is that you're constantly looking out for great subreddits you've never seen before to feature. One of the ways we discover them is through user nominations, where anyone can send in a subreddit they think deserves SROTD ([click here to submit your own!](https://goo.gl/y2rRB3)). A subreddit I discovered this way is /r/DonutSteel, a tongue-in-cheek subreddit with two types of posts (mainly) - the first is where users submit their own tacky [original characters](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/613/323/e2e.jpg) with the declaration that no one should steal them, ironically of course, as if anyone would want to; and the second type is that of the actual unironic OC, typically originally posted on DeviantArt and Tumblr before being widely shared and mocked.    
  
So huge shout out to /u/SpideyTenses who nominated this sub. The initial message I got was ""Some crazy shit going on at r/donutsteel I don't know if it's already been SROTD, but some guy has taken it over with a fan art collection based on a character that is the offspring of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Minion. It's wild. I just hope it gets some more attention."" Now, I didn't know about this subreddit prior to this, nor did I really know about what this subreddit was from just that message, but I was hooked from ""some guy has taken it over with a fan art collection based on a character that is the offspring of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Minion"". When I went over to the sub, it was as described.  
  
/u/Mingehog, whoever they are, has created a whole detailed universe of characters which are based on the premise that Sonic The Hedgehog had offspring with a Minion from the Minion movie Universe. Each day Mingehog (brilliant name, by the way) is releasing new comics based on this universe and the content is top notch.  
  
Overall, the subreddit is great for a laugh and the community is very supportive and kind. Definitely worth a subscribe.   
  
To shine some more light on the origins of this amazing subreddit, here is an interview with the founder of /r/DonutSteel, /u/Deceptichum:  
    
> **1: How did the subreddit begin?**  

>> **/u/Deceptichum** I was posting on a thread, most likely about the Cold Steel/""Nothin' Personnel kid"" meme. Eventually someone made a remark about how there should be a subreddit for OC characters like this and here we are 5 years later with a slowly growing pool of content both genuine and parody.  
  
> **2: What is it like moderating the sub?**  
  
>> **/u/Deceptichum** My moderation style is rather lax, anything that's not spam or outright hateful generally stays but even than the community has been so supportive that it's never been an issue.  

> **3. Do you have a favourite post(s)?**  

>> **/u/Deceptichum** I have a soft spot for the real OC, the ones that somebody uploaded to DeviantArt 10-15 years ago when they were a child. Where they gave a real try to make an original character but they're power fantasy copies.  
  
> **4: Anything else you'd like to add?**  

>> **/u/Deceptichum** If you check out the subreddit, make sure to give all of the Mingehog comics a read as they're a recent addition to the subreddit but there is a lot of effort put into them and they're fast becoming one of the subreddit favourites.

*A warm-blooded egg-laying vertebrate animal distinguished by the possession of feathers, wings, a beak, and typically by being able to fly.*

Notice something strange about that definition? Yeah, there's, for some odd reason, no mention of arms. It is pretty obvious that birds are meant to have [arms](https://www.reddit.com/r/birdswitharms/comments/6vifyj/idk/). Don't you think? Just seems like their anatomy is begging for some beefy forelimbs.

Personally, I can't stop laughing at some of the [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/birdswitharms/comments/6b0dnu/in_the_animal_world/) on here. In addition, it's for sure one of the highest effort and highest quality subreddits out there, despite some of the posts making me outright [uncomfortable](https://www.reddit.com/r/birdswitharms/comments/ht101q/women_birb/).

###The mods were kind enough to stop by for an (albeit small) interview, so let's see what they have to say about certain aspects of the sub:

>#1. What is moderating the sub like? What is your least and most favourite bit about it?

>>**Merari01**  It's pretty relaxed and laid back. The rules are simple. Most items that require moderation are just redirecting people to r/peoplewithbirdheads.
    
>#2. What is your favourite ever post from the subreddit?

>>**Merari01**  Hard to say. We have a user who creates art just to post on this subreddit. I really like that.
    
In general, the sub is very chilled and there's awesome content everywhere- check it out!

**15.8k perfectionists for 9 years**

Picture what your dad would probably have a wet dream to, put it in subreddit form and now you have r/garageporn. A place for people to showcase unnaturally neat tool racks, [lots of bins??](https://www.reddit.com/r/garageporn/comments/htqbqj/getting_closer_one_bin_at_a_time_so_ready_to/) and much, MUCH more! There really is something for everyone here...

Contrary to *a certain recent submission here*, r/garageporn is totally sfw- no need to worry about seeing half naked garages or something of the sort. 

###A sneak peek at some posts...

-[Gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/garageporn/comments/gvin51/pretty_proud_of_this/)

I think you probably get the gist of the sub by now- drooling over other people's productivity... now for a small interview with /u/alphinx!

>#1.Why did you start/join the subreddit?
    
>>**Alphinx**  Garages and workspaces are portraits of those who utilize them. The old proverb is true, ""The garage is the window to the soul."" To see such a glimpse into the true nature of man is highly generative of creative light.
    
>#2. What's moderating the sub like?

>>**Alphinx**  It is a privilege to be a part of a movement that is so singlehandedly shaping the way the world perceives garages.


>#3. What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>>**Alphinx**  There are some really life-changing posts. From garages of people who ride motorcycles to garages of people who like having their tools organized, it is so hard to pick a favorite. Almost all of the posts have a certain undefinable quality. They represent a state of freedom from storm or disturbance and they evoke an almost tangible contentedness. They are all just so good.

>#4. What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**Alphinx** We hope that the subreddit will gain international, worldwide attention so that it can fulfill its purpose of bringing peace to a world full of turmoil. I also think it would be neat if we could have /r/FridgeDetective -esk posts where we try to surmise facts about the poster based on the picture of his or her garage.

>#5. Anything else you want to add?

>>**Alphinx** It is a subreddit full of pictures of well-organized garages. Need I say more?

So whatever it's for- inspiration, flexing or more, get your ass down to r/garageporn

110,780 screaming fans *crossing Abbey Road* for **11 years!**  

The Beatles, aka: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, aka: the Fab Four, are a group that needs no introduction. Any attempt to introduce them in just a few sentences will fail to fully convey their immense combined talent, cultural significance, and overall greatness. Between their stylistic range, beautiful harmonies, and a timeless message of love, the Beatles are indubitably (in my mind) the greatest band of all time, and the art that they produced in such a short period of time speaks for itself.  
  
Such a great band calls for a great subreddit, and luckily, /r/Beatles delivers! Content ranges from discussion, to pictures, videos, and memes! (Although the memes and shitposts are confined to the weekly Shitpost Sunday.) There is also a [poll thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/gil32c/rbeatles_official_poll_thread/) with very interesting and positive discussion (which is rare for Reddit!). The sub also sports a brilliant old Reddit subreddit design - the header scroll of album covers in particular is very cool. Overall, /r/Beatles is a great subreddit to browse through whether you’re a hardcore Beatlemaniac or not.  
  
To elaborate on their love of the band and describe more about the subreddit, here is an interview with a couple of the mods:
    
> **1: At what age did you start listening to The Beatles and what made you fall in love with them?**  

>> **/u/texum** Early teenage years. In junior high, I had to take a class that was essentially music history. At the end of the semester, we watched a documentary called ""The Compleat Beatles"". I vaguely knew the Beatles before that, but thought of them as ""old-fashioned"" music. In the doc, they play the song ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" and talk about how great the ""Sgt. Pepper"" album is. That perked up my ears, since it wasn't what I had thought of the Beatles before then. The next time I was at the local public library, I checked out ""Sgt. Pepper"", and the Red and Blue Albums. I was hooked. It was kind of perfect timing for me personally, because the ""Live At the BBC"" album came out a few months later, and the following year, the ""Anthology"" was released and was a big topic of conversation nationwide.  
  
>> **/u/frogsyjane** I was 13 when I first started listening to The Beatles. I became close friends with a huge Beatles fan, and he made it his mission to make me one, too. He sent me a mixtape with songs mostly from the White Album, and I just loved the complexities of the harmonies and how modern it sounded. We were entering the golden age of alternative music at the time (mid-90s) and these songs were definitely the forerunners. I just felt happy listening to them.  
  
> **2: I'm not sure how tough this question is - who is your favourite of the Fab Four (and is it like picking your favourite child)?**  
  
>> **/u/frogsyjane** I used to be strictly a John girl. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to appreciate Paul’s consistently beautiful melodies. I never disliked his songs, but I think something about John’s badass, creative persona resonated with a younger me. The truth is, The Beatles’ magic came from the tapestry of their relative strengths and weaknesses. If I were asked to pick my top ten favorite songs, I think many would still be John compositions, but there are some absolute stunners by Paul and George, too.  
  
>> **/u/texum** All four were important. Without all four Beatles, it wouldn't have been the same band, and they needed all four to make the band into the international phenomenon they became. This is a question that constantly causes flame wars within the Beatles community, so I'll leave it at that. It's the Kirk vs. Picard, Joel vs. Mike, Lebron v. Jordan of the Beatles community.  

> **3: What are your favourite album(s) and Beatles era?**  

>> **/u/texum** As I alluded to, the first album as an album I fell in love with was Sgt. Pepper. Eventually, I gravitated to Abbey Road, but that didn't last long. For a long time, I would have said Revolver, because of the tremendous leap between it and Rubber Soul that came before it. There's rarely, if ever, been such a tremendous leap between two albums by any band ever, and Revolver remains one of the great albums of all time. That album was showing a band that were willing to explore beyond what they may have been comfortable with, and succeeding at every turn. However, more recently, I think I'd say the White Album is my favorite. It was the band at the peak of their power. At that point, they knew what they were capable of accomplishing. Revolver is a band trying to prove something, while the White Album is a band with nothing left to prove, where they decide to do what they want. Maybe not quite every song works as much as it should, but no song outright fails, either. They explore the breadth and depth of their talent as a band like they did on no other album in their career. So to me, it's the one I think that most resonates. But that opinion has changed before and may change again. Rubber Soul would probably be my favorite if it were any other band. Please Please Me and With The Beatles are amazing in comparison to any other rock albums that came out before 1964. And Help! is criminally underrated.  
  
>> **/u/frogsyjane** My favorite era tends to be just as they were stepping into their more mature shoes. “Rubber Soul” is generally considered the turning point from early to late Beatles, and I love that you can hear such a difference. I maintain you can hear some of that difference in “Help!” which is the album before “Rubber Soul,” but you can also hear some of their beginnings, and I find a lot of joy in that. So “Help!” is one of my favorites, but the other is “Abbey Road,” which feels like a quilt of the 3 main songwriters’ best work.   
  
> **4: Any favourite Beatles quotes?**  

>> **/u/texum** Lyrically, it may be ""And in the end, the love you make is equal to the love you take"". John Lennon's solo ""God"" is also a pretty amazing summary of the whole Beatles' experience up to the end of 1970 (not to mention his own personal journey), especially when juxtaposed with George singing ""My Sweet Lord"" right about the same time. There are a ton of great lyrics in their catalog, it's hard to single anything out. As far as non-lyrical quotes go, it's also hard to pick something out, either. Their 1964 JFK Airport press conference sticks out. One thing you realize when you become a superfan is how smart and funny they really were, how quick-witted they could be, and how constantly they were trying to crack each other up. A Paul quote that sticks out from the Let It Be sessions, is when John starts questioning, ""Why do they call it 'Great' Britain? [Maybe they should call it] 'Fantastic' France. Or 'Amazing' America."" And Paul chimes in, ""'Huge' Spain."" Which gets John laughing. Those kinds of moments are heard throughout the Beatles' career, and are part of what make them special. I love all sorts of other bands, but there are few bands that really had the sense of humor they had, and could balance it with making quality music.  

>> They also loved each other a lot, and wrote a lot about love in general. Much is made of the distance between them after their break-up, but a good quote that sums up their later relationship comes from one of John's last interviews in 1980. When asked about the possibility of a reunion for the umpteenth time, he doesn't dismiss it, but is skeptical it'll ever happen. He then follows up with: ""The Beatles might be over, but John, Paul, George, and Ringo go on. I still love those guys. They'll always be part of my life.""  
  
>> **/u/frogsyjane** My favorite quote comes from Paul, who could snark with the best of them. In 1966, Time magazine reported with some scorn that “Day Tripper” was about a sex worker, and “Norwegian Wood” was about a lesbian. A reporter at a press conference later asked Paul to clarify their intent, and he came out with, “We were just trying to write songs about prostitutes and lesbians, that's all.” I mean, how else are you going to answer that question?    
  
> **5: What types of posts on this subreddit are your favourite? (Between discussions, fan art, memes, etc.)**  

>> **/u/texum** It's all good. It just depends on the post. Some discussion posts are the best. There are some amazing fan art posts, and fan music/performance posts, too. The memes at their best are fantastic, though there are definitely some shitposts (which we try to confine to Sundays).  
  
>> **/u/frogsyjane** I love it when somebody posts a photo or video I’ve never seen, an intimate little moment that lends some more insight into their personalities. The first time I saw my favorite photo of John and Paul together was on this subreddit.  
  
> **6: And lastly, what is your favourite post on the subreddit? (plus anything you'd like to add)**  

>> **/u/texum** Anything new. There can be a lot of repetitive questions, so any news, or any new perspective on an old topic is always welcome. There are some amazing scholars and superfans who are constantly adding new insight, along with newbies who bring in a different perspective and questions that may not have been asked before. So there's always something that keeps it exciting and interesting.  
  
>> **/u/frogsyjane** I don’t really have a favorite post, but I love that the community allows others to share their interpretations of our favorite music and fan art. People are so creative, and I don’t have a creative bone in my body, so I get to live vicariously through others. Admittedly, I haven’t been as involved in the sub as I’d like to be—grad school!—but I hope to bring my A game back soon.

"July 9th, 2020- /r/weeklydictator: A subreddit where anyone can become its dictator",671,ho1ujm,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/ho1ujm/july_9th_2020_rweeklydictator_a_subreddit_where/,20,"r/WeeklyDictator is a subreddit that tries to simulate a place under dictatorial rule. Anyone is able to become The Dictator for at least a week at a time, but in order to do so, they must make propaganda, start revolutions, and rise to the top.

There is, however, way more to the subreddit than just becoming the dictator. You could get one of the many different government positions, you could join one of the (fake) political parties, you could merely participate as a citizen, the list goes on.

Much of the subreddit's lore could be discovered on our website we update regularly. Moreover, if you're just wanting to chat, you could participate in one of our subreddit's chatrooms or simply join our discord. If you have any questions relating to the subreddit, read the top pinned post.

Why rule with an iron fist, when you could rule with a golden one?

[/r/Felogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Felogy) is a place to discover words you've never heard of, because they don't exist.

They're completely imaginary markov-generated words that *sound* like English words, but *totally* aren't. Words like aften, forliatitive, and toconance. You could use them in a complete sentence, but you'd sound like a peabonswit. Or you can slip them in the middle of a perfectly considly sentence, and nobody would know the difference.

I got introduced to [/r/Felogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Felogy) through a [thread in late 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6rk2yr/comment/dl5nb87) on dataisbeautiful, and since became obsessed. The sub slipped into dormancy later in the game, but I brought it back to life with a ""Nown of the day"" bot that I built. You can also [request a word from the bot here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=felogybot&subject=Hi!&message=I%27d%20like%20a%20word,%20Trebeck!).

Think of the possibilities. Lewis Carroll coined the word ""chortle"" in a nonsense poem, ""Jabberwocky"", and there are words being minted all the time—and not all through nonsense poems. Imagine what we can do through the power of the internet. (We have monthly contests that feature nonsense poems if that's what you're into as well.)

You know words that just *feel* right or wrong—or one way or another—based on connotation? There's a real thing going on here. Think of how you would define ""ashoundly"". Now how about ""hodittle""? What about ""forticience""? You would think one's probably terrifying, the other cute, and another intelligent or strong. So you're more likely to define them that way, and people are more likely to agree on your definitions that way.

And you know words that lack definition in the English language? There are real words (yes, moving on to real words now) like ""Forelsket"" (Norwegian) and ""Wabi-Sabi"" (Japanese) that have no proper English translation. We do that all the time here: generate a word, make up a creative definition, and we have a brand new word. It's up to us to first ""Proun"" these ""Nowns"", define them, and agree on them.

The English Language was designed by a committee. Rumor has it that the platypus was made the same way. [/r/Felogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Felogy) intends to put them to shame. Well—the committee part, I mean.

Famous Definitions:

* [Twad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Felogy/comments/6s5tv8/twad_n_pejorative_slang_used_to_describe_an/)
* [Amorth](https://www.reddit.com/r/Felogy/comments/6rnc7c/amorth_n_the_value_one_has_in_terms_of_friendship/)

/r/FolkUnknown is a place to discover new folk music that you otherwise may never have heard of. You can post any kind of folk that is new or obscure enough that you don't think we've heard it yet. Oftentimes on subs like /r/Folk the most popular posts can be lots of the same artists and sets, which is fine for most listeners, but oftentimes many of the best pieces of folk music can be found in the relatively obscure places. Folk music is an enormous genre, if you can even call it a single genre, and there's so much to listen to, and so much that unfortunately goes unlistened too simply because it's not well enough known. /r/FolkUnknown seeks to help bring these pieces to light!

Here are some of the types of folk acts you'll see on this sub:

[Luke Carey - Big Fish (2019, Live song premiere)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgizlUF_v7k)

[Brazen Thieves - debut EP (2020, bandcamp album)](https://brazenthieves.bandcamp.com/releases)

And if it is a bigger name, it is a song which is new...

[Sarah Jarosz - Orange and Blue (2020, Living room performance of a single off her upcoming album ""World on the Ground"" out June 5th)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv-Y2iYZi28)

[Colter Wall - Cattle Call (2020, Live cover for Little Jack Films)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2lxXG5ZGVQ)

... or performed in a different style...

[Bill Ryder-Jones ft. Marcus Mumford - Seabirds (2016, La Blogothèque's A Takeaway Show series)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_AZOWl-Moc)

[Tors - Sorry (2020, Isolation Edition)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp4Mnj_gMLw)

...or both...

[Taylor Ashton ft. Darlingside - Nicole (2020, Darlingside accompany him on his song live in concert as he opens for them)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYbsgND8Sc4)

...so that it is fresh to even avid folk fans.

If you enjoy folk music, or even just want to learn more about it, /r/FolkUnknown is an excellent sub for it!

You'll need to gear up. Where could you find weapons with the strength to take down such creatures?Why, in the shop, of course. The /r/ItemShop!! ^(im not apologising for that)

/r/ItemShop is a sister sub of /r/BossFight, except while /r/Bossfight specialises in the bosses themselves, /r/ItemShop deals in images of weird objects instead. It takes mildly cursed images of various objects, gives them a name, tells us the object's effects, and gives us whatever DND-esque lore it needs. You have [deadly weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItemShop/comments/emp4e5/old_timey_slap_bracelet_70_flexibility_25_attack/), [tomes of great knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItemShop/comments/dkj6i6/the_holy_trilogy_100_speech_to_female_npcs_50/), [suits of impenetrable armour](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItemShop/comments/e2a40j/cats_armadillo_armor_50_armor_20_speed_30_chance/), any powerful item of the arcane you can imagine, you can probably find a shitty bootleg version of here!

**7,289** *subscribers* for **1 year**!

&nbsp;

r/neapolitanpizza is, as you probably already have guessed, about pizza from the centre of Italy - Naples.


Different to pizza most people know, Neapolitan pizza is traditionally baked in a wood-fired oven with a floor temperature of 380-430°C/716-806°F and a dome temperature of 485°C/905°F. The baking of the pizza takes only 60-90 seconds. 
The pizza also has a raised edge, called *cornicione*, and has (due to the high temperature and quick bake) a soft and elastic texture.

But Neapolitan pizza is not only about some technical data, it also embodies a philosophy of using a few but high-quality ingredients. Good tomatoes, fresh mozzarella fior di latte (cow)/mozzarella di bufala (buffalo) and so on.

r/neapolitanpizza is a place for admirers of Neapolitan Pizza and for those who want to learn more about it. Our members cook with different ovens, such as: Ooni, Roccbox, Wood-Fired (Brick) Oven or Effe Uno (electric oven) and thus providing the community with valuable experience. 

But we don't only accept homemade pizza, Neapolitan pizza that has been consumed by our members at a restaurant are also welcomed.

Our mission is also to make Neapolitan pizza known to more people and to teach those who are interested in this type of pizza. Therefore we offer resources such as a [Glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/neapolitanpizza/wiki/resources/glossary), what [Baker's Percentages](https://www.reddit.com/r/neapolitanpizza/wiki/resources/bakers-percentages) are or [useful links](https://www.reddit.com/r/neapolitanpizza/wiki/resources/links) to YouTube channels, flour mills, books or websites.

Currently, we also work on tutorials like: Homemade Mozzarella or dough making process from the start to the end, made by our users.

Some examples from our members:

**31,495** *readers* for **6 years**!

&nbsp;

For as long as Reddit has existed and idiotic teens have had internet access, there has been a phenomenon known as Summer Reddit. Every summer and really every holiday season, the quality of the Reddit front page gets objectively and measurably worse, as 15 year olds cone flocking to the site en masse, with their terrible 42069 jokes and ""ha that look like penis please laugh"" and all the other fun cringeworthy shitposts that they bring with them. Perhaps it's just all of us old folk going out of touch, or maybe it's that ***the number 69 is not funny in the slightest and neither is responding ""Nice."" 50 times*** *. 

^(* Note that there are exceptions, including particularly high effort shitposts that are meant to be ironic. Not many exceptions though.)

Now Summer Reddit may have started... A little early this year, for whatever reason. And while it's true that as subs like r/teenagers and r/pewdiepiesubmissions grow, the symptoms of traditional Summer Reddit begin to diminish, it is still most certainly a noticeable effect. Also, there's nothing that Reddit love more than relentlessly making fun of people who don't know how to be funny. 

As you may have already gathered, /r/SummerReddit is a subreddit for highlighting these classic Reddit moments of immensely terrible attempts at humour that become oh so common this time of year. Now clicking on the sub you might notice one thing, that being that it's apparently **dead as fuck**. Did the SrotD mods even check the sub beforehand, you may ask? Fret not, imaginary person, for there's a good reason. In the spirit of the season, /r/SummerReddit is private for most of the year, only coming out when that special time of year comes to pass. As of this feature being made, /r/SummerReddit has just opened for this year! ~~Actually it opened like 2 days ago but shhhhh~~ 

Due to the nature of this sub, it would not be useful to highlight any of the current good posts, since they're all, you know, from last summer. But still, you're all smart and funny, you know the types of post that go on this sub! The type which you find on the top of /r/all, that you'd think would be peak /r/comedycemetery material, but has like 30k upvotes and enough Reddit Premium to pay off your mortgage. We've all seen then and cringed a little inside at them. If you've not seen them, somehow, go to any meme sub and you'll find them. 69 jokes, sex jokes, /r/imveryedgy shit, peak Reddit Moments with insulting normies and ""reddit do your thing"" and all sorts. In short, shitposts. They pop up in every corner of Reddit. It's all memes now. There are only a few large subs that don't allow memes in any capacity these days, as they've become so entrenched in the culture of the site and of the Internet as a whole. It's just an unfortunate truth that 1. Like, all of these memes are made by teenagers, and 2. Most of them are trash.


I suppose it could be time to simply accept that Summer Reddit doesn't hit as well as it used to. I very much disagree with the idea that Reddit is dying or anything of the sort, but it can't be denied that it's changed a lot since June 2013, when this sub was made. ""Meme culture"" has taken hold, and meaningful discussion has largely been pushed aside for circlejerks and shitposts. Similar to the global climate in years to come, Reddit may be entering an eternal summer, in which those that we laughed at and mocked in years prior, come to define the platform. Or perhaps this is all just alarmist bullshit, and this sub is just a mean spirited pedestal upon which the old guard can mock kids just trying to have fun with their SrGrafo meme templates and their wholesome 100 breathtaking Reddit Moments. I suppose that's all up for debate. Either way, Summer Reddit, whether it's still around or not, was a thing, and this sub will continue to diligently highlight the shittiest shitposts that Reddit have to offer this season.

[r/beyondwholesome](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondwholesome) is one of the happiest of the subreddits. During this difficult time, our goal is to make everyone feel much happier and relaxed based on a beyond wholesome, funny, and a cute setting!

""Beyond wholesome"" means a further side of wholesome, or more than just wholesome. Whether the post makes you smile and cry at the same time, or laugh and think it's really cute at the same time, it's beyond wholesome content! Just to be clear, memes, GIFs, videos, and text are all allowed!

Yes, you may be thinking, ""But there are already many other similar subreddits created before this."" For example, r/sodamnwholesome, r/wholesome, r/MadeMeSmile, etc. But r/beyondwholesome was created to be beyond wholesome, not exactly just wholesome. More like a mixed feeling of not only wholesomeness, but above it. Above the clouds. Above human imagination.

Sometimes mods will post a beyond wholesome content (comics, videos, pics, etc.) and ask members of the community to pick a title for the content. Then whoever posts the best title for the content will earn a GOLD AWARD! Other types of events are also expected to come... stay tuned, fellow Redditor!

We have introduced many post flairs including ""Cute"", ""Beyond wholesome"", ""Awwwwwww"", ""Made my day"", ""Funny"", and many more to feed up content! Every week, mods will flair ""Post of the week"" for the best posts posted in 7 days, and they may be likely to also give an award unexpectedly! Also, over 10 interesting and wholesome new user flairs have been created to make yourself feel included!

Best beyond wholesome post: https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondwholesome/comments/g49all/i_think_this_fits_here_hopefully/

You probably saw all of that hype of Animal Crossing: New Horizons and DOOM Eternal, being both released on the same day. I really wasn't familiar with those games before, but the sudden influx of the hype got me interested. However, I don't own Switch for Animal Crossing, nor high-end PC for DOOM Eternal, I've decided to stick with the mobile version of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. For DOOM, I tested out the original 1993 DOOM.

What I've noticed about the Animal Crossing community is, that it's really positive and kind, which fits the style of the game too. The game is so relaxing and your stress easily abates. Just visit your animal friends, fulfill tasks, and design your island meanwhile listening to the calming soundtrack and hearing the steps of walking on the grass. If you are more of a green thumb, the game also introduces you to gardening!

r/ACNHGardening is a subreddit for those green thumbs. The community there helps out on watering the flowers, giving advice, trading garden-related items, showcasing own gardens, and hosting giveaways. I'm really surprised by the sub's fast growth; over 17 000 subscribers just in 2 weeks. I didn't expect that at all, and most likely neither did the moderators. Let's ask a few questions from the creators of the sub u/cizzie97 and u/Calico-Queen, and from a moderator u/N3DSdude.

>#1. You've had an incredible growth on the sub. Did you expect that at all? How has that impacted how you moderate the sub?
    
>>**cizzie97**: It's been crazy I really didn’t expect much, in terms of modding we are very lucky to have an amazing mods team here on Reddit and Discord and we do our best to keep up with everything. 

>>**Calico-Queen**:  It’s absolutely insane if I’m being honest, when I joined the moderator team, the sub had 77 members. I genuinely thought that it’d stop at 100 or so, but within two hours it grew into over 1k members I believe. I think it really hit how big it was going to get when we hit trending on Reddit in less than 72 hours. It’s impacted the way I moderate the sub by being more aware of what’s going on. I tend to check the subreddit quite a few times a day, and make sure when I have a moment and see something I love or can help with I comment. I want people to know that they are being seen and that their posts are making people think or putting a smile on someone’s face.

>>**N3DSdude**:  It's impacted quite a lot, I'm having to keep an eye on the mod queue because of the insane amount of posts we get but it's great to see the community booming.

>#2. What's the best thing about moderating r/ACNHGardening? And what's the worst?

>>**cizzie97**:  The best thing is definitely seeing everyone’s pretty flowers and the wholesomeness of it all. The worst has to be our mods don’t get our flowers watered as much as we’d like.

>>**Calico-Queen**:  Oh my gosh I absolutely love modding for r/ACNHGardening! My favorite thing though would be when people post pictures of their garden. They aren’t often, but when I see them they put a smile on my face, and I really wish people would share their photos more. They give me so many ideas on how to make my little island in-game better. 
    I definitely think that the worst thing would be when I find out someone goes in and purposely destroys someone’s garden. I mean it’s a game yes, BUT so many of us have put countless hours into it to make our islands something we love. A lot of us use this as our creative outlet, socialization, helping others, and even to just enjoy something of our own. Something we can have control over, and something that can help us relax after a bad day. I just don’t understand the pleasure people get out of ruining something that someone worked so hard for.

>>**N3DSdude**:  The best thing moderating the Reddit would be the wholesome community, its nice to see individuals helping each out by watering their flowers in New Horizons. The worse thing about moderating the subreddit would be dealing with a lot of scammers who are trying to steal flowers from players, it can sour the player's experience which is bad.

>#3. For an outsider who sees the community from the view of a normal user, it looks very positive. How do you see your community from the perspective of a moderator?

>>**cizzie97**:  Definitely positivity all around! Every day it’s lovely flower gardens or gardeners saying thank you to others for the help they have received I just hope it continues in this direction for as long as people play  ACNH

>>**Calico-Queen**:  I love this community so much, and I am in awe over how helpful people are. They literally go out of their way to find infographics and Google documents for people who need help. People go out of their way to help water, and will even give away flowers for free more often than not. It’s incredible to watch this community evolve, and share information with each other. 
There are always good days and bad days when it comes to the internet, but this subreddit almost always puts a smile on my face. It makes me happy to know that there are people out there, who genuinely care about making other people happy. Even if it’s virtual, at this time in all of our lives this game is something a lot of us truly needed. We needed to be able to have an outlet, a way to be creative, and more importantly, a way to socialize with friends and family both new and old.

>>**N3DSdude**:  I see the community from the perspective of a moderator as very promising because of how helpful and amazing the community is. As long as scammers are prevented from causing bad experiences the ACNH Garden Party Reddit will continue to thrive!

I'm appreciating the moderators taking the time to write these. Just for your information, the creators of this sub had no past experience from moderating or creating a Reddit community. Thus, they made a hit sub on the first try. I recommend this sub for every Animal Crossing: New Horizons player. If you really aren't specialized in gardening, the sub also gives out advice on designing and giveaways. As I'm not an ACNH player, I just love to watch how positive the community is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modernism is a global architecture and design movement that emerged in the 1920s as a response to accelerated industrialization and social changes. Pursuing ""order"" and ""universality"" in architecture, modernism utilized new materials and advanced technology and rejected old, traditional, historical ideas and styles, and ornamentation. Modernism emphasized function, simplicity, and rationality, and created new forms of expression with a new aesthetic.

One of the main things that differentiated modernism from the previous architectural movements was the strong sense of social responsibility, in which architecture should raise the living conditions of the masses, almost completely forgotten until then. As a result, this movement gained mass popularity after the WW2, when modernist planning was implemented as a solution to the previous failure of architecture and design to meet basic social needs. During the 1930s as much as 15% of the urban populations were living in poverty, and slum clearance was one of the many social problems of this decade.

This new aesthetic resulted in modern buildings characterized by clean lines, simple geometric shapes, pure cubic forms, ribbon windows, flat roofs, and functional, flexible open interior spaces with plainly exposed structures that were considered appropriate for all nations and cultures.

Reddit is a wonderful place. You've got so many awesome subreddits, whether relating to politics, gaming, technology, economics, or social issues, that it gets tough to decide whihc sub to read. Oh, and the memes. Reddit makes the damnedest best memes, ain't i right? The tens of subreddit memes can make even a stone-hearted man laugh.

Now, you and I are probably reading this ourselves. But there are people who are unable to see (or too lazy to read). Screen-readers come in handy here, allowing the users to listen to the content as it is read aloud by a TTS service. But. therein lies the catch.

Reading out text-based posts? Easy-peasy, consider it done. But what do we do in the case of memes, or other images? This is where the very awesome team at /r/TranscribersOfReddit come in. The volunteer team spends their time transcribing the text from images in a comprehensive and formatted way, making it easier for the differently-abled to participate on reddit.

/r/TranscribersOfReddit is an example of volunteers stepping up to fill the gaps unknowingly created by the rapid advancement of technology. Feel interested and want to contribute? Go on to the sub, read their FAQ and the rules, and you could be a transcriber too!

Have you ever experienced an eerie sensation while walking through a hotel hallway late at night? How about while crossing through an empty parking garage, or while being inside a school during break? If you can recall this feeling, you’re already familiar with the concept—and sensation—of liminality. Liminal spaces are hard to define with words alone, but you’ll know them as soon as you have the pleasure (or displeasure) of encountering them in real life.

As one website notes, “liminal spaces are transitional or transformative spaces. They are the waiting areas between one point in time and space and the next.” That is, they’re physical spaces that are typically occupied only for a limited time as we move from one place to another. Being in these places—stairwells, elevators, airport terminals—at odd hours or for an unusual amount of time can feel uncomfortable, nostalgic, and even creepy.

/r/LiminalSpace serves as an archive for photos and videos of physical spaces that produce these emotions. In 8 short months, the subreddit has grown into an active community dedicated to creating and sharing in the experience of liminality. See below for a collection of some of the subreddit’s top posts:

Better Call Saul is a prequel series to Breaking Bad. I don't need to explain either to you; you know what they are. Breaking Bad is practically everyone's favorite show and Better Call Saul is nearby in the list. It's about Saul Goodman, originally Jimmy McGill, and focuses on his life prior to the events of Breaking Bad. He practices law, improves his sly skills, and meets people who help form him into the sly-talking shyster we love.

The BB/BCS fan community is insane, but they were made that way by Vince Gilligan, who makes use of double meanings and subtlety in design like a bird makes use of wings. One of my favorite images from /r/BreakingBad was a picture of a scene where Walter, Skyler, Hank, and Marie were sitting at a restaurant. Arrows and circles were drawn everywhere, pointing at every object and explaining deep conspiracy-level significance to all of them. The insanity has dialed down some for Better Call Saul, but the remaining crazy lies under the surface as you can tell everyone owns cork boards full of red string connecting pictures of minor characters with random background props. I love it.

I love Better Call Saul. I loved Breaking Bad (shocker). I loved El Camino. I've been a Gilligan fan since The X-Files, another show I adore, where he continuously showed off amazing work. His season 3 episode, Pusher, remains one of my all-time favorites. You should never underestimate his writing, and every season finale he's written has especially proved that.

The season 5 finale of Better Call Saul is tonight at 9PM EST. It's no surprise that I'm excited. I have my own predictions and wishes, some more realistic than others. I asked a couple of /r/BetterCallSaul moderators what their hopes were for the finale, and here's what they said.

**/u/skinkbaa:** Honestly, I just hope it will be something all of us (the fans) can appreciate. So far Peter Gould has been taking the show in a fantastic direction and with each episode it just gets better and better. I don't have many hopes, I think whatever he does will be brilliant. I guess my only hope is that Kim survives.

**/u/RainbowDiamond:** I would love a good plot twist to really kick start the next season so we have a good tempo from the get go. This season has been one of the best in terms of quality that we've not seen since peak Breaking Bad and it's truly gripping so if they manage to keep that level for the rest of the show I'll be more than happy with any finale they throw at us.

As for my hopes? So long as we get Mike vs Lalo it'll be 10/10 for me. My far-flung hope? Teenage Jesse. Other than that, I have no idea.

We'll just have to watch and see, and then debate it nonstop on /r/BetterCallSaul for a few months afterward until we all go insane. As is tradition.

""*Crypt of the NecroDancer is an award-winning hardcore roguelike rhythm game. Move to the music and deliver beatdowns to the beat! Groove to the epic Danny Baranowsky soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection!*"" says the description of Crypt of the Necrodancer on Steam Store, with all reviews being overwhelmingly positive.

r/necrodancer a sub based on a 2D roguelike rhythm game, Crypt of the Necrodancer, which was fully released back in 2015 by Brace Yourself Games. In the game, you have to move on the beat with optionally being able to choose different soundtracks in randomly generated dungeons across 4 different zones meanwhile fighting monsters and bosses, collecting items and weapons and continuing onto the next levels as long as you reach the final boss. You also are able to play with different characters with different stories, when every one of them has different abilities, upgrades or downgrades and some being harder than others. As you die in this game, you lose the process on the current run and have to start over.

r/necrodancer lets the community to post videos, discussions, artworks, progress on the game, screenshots and so on, almost anything related to the game. The community is positive and polite there from my perspective. I lurked into the sub about a year ago when I had dozens of hours played.

I absolutely had a good experience with the sub's community. I received advice on how to play a character from the game, ""Bolt"", and they really helped! I've made better progress on the game with that character. An another thing I've learned is that the progress on this game takes a lot of time and you should not give up, and achieving the goal will make you really satisfied.

The game is currently -80% on sale in Steam Store. Why not giving it a try or begin the game with your friends?

While sitting around deciding what sort of subreddit to feature, I had a thought: I'm hungry. I really want a cheeseburger, maybe one with lots of onions and pickles. I think about it more and more and my hunger grows. I eat a packet of ramen, but it doesn't fill the void. It's not just a hunger of the stomach, but a hunger of the soul.

There's a sort of in-joke among us asexuals that the only thing we love is cake. It's beautiful form, it's moist and spongy interior, it's delicious frosting... How can you not love it? Well, I'm voracious. Cake is love, but a good burger is the lust of hunger. 

So that's why /r/Burgers gets the spot today. I'm hungry. I want a burger and god dammit, there's a burger right there on the front page. Several, even! Filled with thick meat, with those saucy looks, just begging to be eaten.

Thanks /r/Burgers. You make me hungry in stomach and full in spirit.

**338,306 readers** for **8 years!**

[It's been a while since we last featured PatientGamers.](https://reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/z0hnw/august_29_2012_rpatientgamers_all_good_1ups_comes/) Too long, I think. Nearly eight years, and my backlog is even larger than it was then. How time flies...

/r/PatientGamers is rather simple in its idea: New games are expensive, clouded by hype, can be difficult to run, and often have not been patched to remove bugs yet. Instead of dealing with that, why not have some patience and wait a little while? There are more games than one could play in ten lifetimes, so relax and let the others rush out in front. Take your time and enjoy yourself.

For me, my backlog stretches all the way back to 1993. Secret of Mana had just come out, but '93 was a busy year, so I promised I would come back to it. Well, 27 years later I still haven't gotten around to it. Others have been added to the backlog in the meantime, too. Many, many others. Way more than I can list here. I'm one of those people that procrastinates doing things I want to do (playing a game, watching a TV show, seeing a movie) but will jump in headfirst on things I hate doing. I never missed a school assignment or ran over a deadline at work, but I still haven't gotten around to beating Final Fantasy VII or seeing Firefly.

The crowd on /r/PatientGamers is made up of people like me. We don't mind waiting a little while. It really is no big deal if I go a few months, or even years, without playing some new game. Unless it's an online-only multiplayer game then it doesn't matter at all when you play it, and if it is, well, I generally don't care for those anyway. The great thing about such a good community is that you've got people who understand and will discuss older games with you when you finally do get around to playing them. You can even coordinate and play alongside others who also have the same game in their backlogs and get recommendations based on what you've been meaning to play.

The subreddit also hosts a [list of essential games, which you can find here](http://patientgamers.net). It is of course by no means exhaustive, and I could name, off the top of my head, dozens of other titles I'd consider essential, but I think I have high expectations. The very fact that [Secret of the Magic Crystals](https://store.steampowered.com/app/45100/Secret_of_the_Magic_Crystals/) isn't listed is nearly damning by itself, and even bordering on heresy. Still, it does do a good job of listing a lot of the big titles that you'd expect most to have played.

Try being a patient gamer. Firstly, you're going to save a lot of money. You're going to run them better due to (depending on how patient you are) having better hardware than what existed when it came out. You're going to be able to enjoy it free of the hype miasma that makes objective play and discussion of new games nearly impossible. Did I mention you'll save money?

Give it a try. Instead of picking up that new $60 AAA title, just wait a while and get it for $15 in a few months, with fewer bugs, more support, and without the hype. Be patient. I've been told it's a virtue.

**5,972 readers** for **4 years!**

Highlighting a community surrounding a YouTuber (or 'Content Creator', whichever name you prefer) is different than most. Like specific game subreddits, you have to talk about the content produced and why it appeals to people in order to understand the community around it. For me, this isn't the easiest task.

I got introduced to Sinvicta not long ago through the YouTube algorithm. I had searched for something completely unrelated (an episode of DBZ Abridged) but YouTube decided to show me a video of his. Bored out of my mind by being trapped inside my home like an agoraphobic groundhog, I watched it. It was a video of him playing The Binding of Isaac, which is a pretty popular game so I won't go into detail on what it is. I'd watched another person's Binding of Isaac videos before, a spectacularly bald Canadian man, and had for some time, so I was no stranger to the concept. If you were to ask me what made these two different, I wouldn't have one good answer for you. Their styles are different in too many small ways for me to really offer a conclusive answer. One is a heavy metal musician, though, and that makes it cooler by default.

I watch videos like these while I do other things. Just this morning I watched one of his Isaac videos while slowly losing my hair trying to understand my ISP's ridiculous custom router firmware. It's relaxing to have it in the background. The youngsters are all obsessed with the newfangled ASMR stuff, but all I need is some nerd talking about stat gains to get me relaxed. Not to say that it isn't entertaining. It definitely is.

There's a definite satisfaction in watching someone play a game well, especially when it's one you suck at. The level of interest, competence, and skill involved keeps me interested every time and all throughout. I love seeing the ways he breaks the game and blasts through things that I used to always get stuck on. His win streak is higher than the total amount of times I've played it. Like watching a speedrun, I like seeing him own the game completely. He's also got an odd obsession with a very friendly spider, but I can't fault him. Sissy Longlegs is adorable, but being wildly entomophobic and arachnophobic, she can keep her distance from me.

Now, I focused on that one series because that's what I watch most, but he does have other content. He's playing Animal Crossing, does GeoGuessr games with NorthernLion (another creator, and aforementioned bald man), and seemingly just wrapped up a series on [Lobotomy Corporation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/568220/Lobotomy_Corporation__Monster_Management_Simulation/). He streams a lot of his content on Twitch as well if you prefer seeing your content live in front of you.

Why should you watch him? It's entertaining. If you're at all interested in the games he plays you should really check him out, especially (in the case of The Binding of Isaac) if you like seeing things break and get ridiculous, or if you want to see the stress of nearly losing a several hundred game win streak on the bad runs. Why should you check out the subreddit? It's a fun place full of memes. The youngsters love memes. I especially like how he selects memes from his subreddit to show at the beginning of his videos when they catch his attention. 

It highlights an aspect of Sinvicta that I like, and I heard it first on a somewhat-older video of his: He mentions not really wanting to, or being okay with the idea of, not growing much further than where he is now. In 2020 it's rare to see a Youtuber who doesn't want to own the world and make tens of millions off of it, get their own TV movie, and own a skyscraper made out of pictures of their face. It helps give a sense of soul behind the content. Despite being a professional, he comes off as a person, not a brand. It's refreshing and plays a bigger role in determining who I watch than one might expect.

Also, as I said, he's in a metal band. His fans are referred to as the Mosh Pit. Hell yeah. \m/

So check out /r/Sinvicta. You can [check out his YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/user/sinvicta316) as well as [his Twitch channel here](https://www.twitch.tv/sinvicta) and, if you're inclined, [his bandcamp](https://sinvicta.bandcamp.com/releases) for metal fans to appreciate.

Long-time gamers will know what I mean when I say that, once in a very long time, a game will come around and connect with you in a way that nothing else does. Something about it feels right. Like pitching a perfect game of Baseball, the stars align and the world bends itself in your favor, and you find a game that immediately takes a place in your heart that can never be replaced.

Suikoden was one such game for me. Even now, I can't tell you why. It's like trying to tell someone the difference between two shooters, where one has satisfying weapons and the other doesn't. What made Suikoden *better* than all those other JRPGs I was playing in the late 90s?

Well, for one, it has 108 people you can recruit (well, counting your protagonist). This is something I'd never seen before, and wouldn't again until another favorite, Radiata Stories, came out in 2005 for the PS2. A lot of RPGs talk about gathering an army, but you only really get 4-6 people and that's it. That's not an army, that's a posse. Well, in Suikoden, you get an *army*. More on that in a minute.

First, I must say this: Suikoden I is my favorite. Suikoden II is a masterpiece, and probably the *better* game, but I like the first more. Suikoden III was good, but my PS2 kept eating my saves so I never beat it. Suikoden IV was good. I only played a half-hour of Suikoden V before somebody stole it and I never got around to playing it again. I'll be rectifying these things (III and V) soon. With that said, let's continue.

In Suikoden, when you're not putting the hurt on anyone who isn't you, you're progressing through a ridiculously awesome story. It doesn't matter which game you're playing, the story is fantastic.

That said, the first one has something no other game (besides very briefly in II) has: Gremio. Gremio is the name of the greatest character in the series. The second greatest character, also in I and just as great in IV, is Ted. Ted needs no explanation.

When you're not chilling with your awesome buds and putting the hurt on people who aren't you, you're also commanding an army. Remember the army? Yeah, there are these things called Army Battles which pit you and several thousand of your closest friends against some people who are about to be very sorry they insulted Gremio in my presence. Surprise! There's a whole other tier to the RPG. But wait: Surprise again! You can also do 1-on-1 duels against people. This is usually because somebody insulted your best friend for life Gremio and you need to throw down to defend his honor.

Otherwise, combat is normal. Sort of. Suikoden 1 and 2 especially have a mixture of 2D graphics in a 3D space, mixed with interesting camera angles that make the combat a lot cooler in feel than in other JRPGs I've played. Remember how I said how hard it is to describe how a weapon feels satisfying while another doesn't? That's this here. Hitting people feels good. Winning feels good. Everything, especially the golden hair of my true love Gremio, feels good. II feels great. IV kind of got away from it a bit, but the rest of the presentation was too good to fault it overall.

Some fanbases never go away. /r/Suikoden is still burning bright even after a decade since its inception. The community surrounding the series is like an island fortress full of weird people and good music: It does its own thing and will keep doing so, no matter what. If you are a fan of the game, interested in checking out some of the world's best RPGs, or want to relive some nostalgia, be sure to check it out.

So, in summary: Why should you play these games? They're amazing. Why should you check out /r/Suikoden? Because its community is great and for fans of the series it's the #1 place to be. Why should you show Gremio the love he so rightly deserves? Because he is a glorious golden god, that's why.

You have no idea how hard it is for me to not just make this entire article a clusterfuck of memes. I'm going to try and avoid it, but I can't make any promises.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a polarizing anime. You either love it or hate it. Nobody is neutral on it; nobody likes or dislikes it. You're either out here posing and shit or you're staring at the walls of Plato's cave in tears while the rest of us enjoy the glory of 「The Sun」. To be honest, I didn't watch it myself for quite a while in no small part because of the art style. It threw me off and looked weird. Then, one day, while bored out of my skull, I decided to load up the very first episode just to see what it was all about.

After watching all four (now five) parts in a few days, I still didn't know what it was about, but I knew I loved it. So I watched it again. I looked online to see where things were going and learned that no matter how bizarre it has been so far, it's got nothing on what's coming. So, what is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure about?

Two English kids in the 1800s, named Jonathan and Dio, become adopted brothers. Dio doesn't really like Jonathan and is kind of a dick due to his horrible father, whereas Jonathan is a true gentleman. Problems arise. These problems span over a century and have wide-reaching consequences that change the face of the Earth forever, involving everything from ancient vampires to [nazis](https://i.redd.it/zxpznqlndvs21.jpg) to obese mafiosos to killer babies to a guy who kills people with cutlery. There are many adventures, they are bizarre, and they typically involve at least one person named JoJo. Except for that one time it was GioGio, but it's pronounced the same so it still counts.

JoJo is ripe for memes. Practically every line is just oozing potential for it. Every pose, every song, every beautiful duwang. /r/ShitpostCrusaders is the place for those memes. There are other subreddits for the show, but honestly, you can find a better discussion of the show in its memes and comments than anywhere else I've seen.

Just don't mention that you skipped part one or two. They're integral to the plot. Watch them. Also, don't ask them how Jotaro's hat stays on. That is *forbidden knowledge*.

I want to get something out of the way: Shining Force II is my favorite game of all time.

Shining Force I came out for the Sega Genesis in 1992, followed by its sequel in 1993, but we in America got each of them a year late. Prior to this was Shining in the Darkness in 1991, but it was a different genre and I wasn't a big fan of it. The series continued until Shining Force III in 1997, with some others like CD in the interlude. After that the series went off the rails, changed genres again, and became something different.

But for those beautiful years, the Shining series was a shining beacon of tactical RPGs in the West. It went mostly unnoticed by most people in the gaming press and has still not reached any major acclaim even as a classic to this day despite how widespread and strong its continuing fanbase is. A few decades of time haven't stopped people from wishing for a remaster, buying rereleases, and praying to their Jogurt shrines every night. You guys don't have a shrine to Jogurt? Just me? Okay.

A fan's a fan no matter the time involved. My Metallica CDs didn't go bad after their music did, and neither do my cartridges. For this point, look to /r/ShiningForce, reddit's fan community for the series. It's not the biggest community, but you only need a party of twelve to save the world. If you've ever been to a niche fan subreddit then you know what you'll see: Good posts, a good community, and essentially everything related to it on reddit. The sidebar is full of valuable links to other communities and resources and the mods are dedicated to a fault.

The greatest resource I will link is a recent-ish post from a moderator, which is stickied at the top of the subreddit, giving a total rundown of what Shining Force is, what the history of the series has been, who made it, what games are in it, how to play it... It's got everything. It is probably the most definitive and all-encompassing explanation available, so go read it [here, at this link, the link for the readers, the link chosen especially to educate readers. The readers' link](https://reddit.com/r/ShiningForce/comments/ergn1m/interested_in_shining_force_welcome/).

You may ask why Shining Force II is my favorite game. Why not the first one or the third or CD? Why not other games in the genre like Fire Emblem? Why not other Camelot games like Golden Sun? Why not the GBA port of SF1 (which I liked)? Well, I'm not going to explain it. Sorry, but it would take too long. As much as I am known for rambling, I legitimately don't have the space to give you *that* explanation. It would be a very long essay.

Just play them. They're masterpieces of video gaming and should be appreciated by everyone. Play through them, and if you like them and also like being hurt for pleasure, check out some of the fan-made mods like the Tactics mod. If you like speedrunning, the games have an active speedrunning community made up of some great runners, too, and it's a pretty simple run to get into if you're looking for something new to play. SFII's Granseal Escape run is popular, quick, and good for beginners.

And if you have questions, check out the discord community linked in the subreddit's sidebar. Or, hell, feel free to ask me. My answer will usually be ""just use Peter"", because that's usually the solution, but it never hurts to ask.

Thank you for reading and for checking out a great community.

/r/ImaginaryWeather is a really cool sub! As the name would suggest, it focuses on edited images and artwork of the weather. There's a lot of artistic potential in the weather. We all love [beautiful snowy landscapes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWeather/comments/eo4u2c/snowstorm_by_michal_kv%C3%A1%C4%8D/) and [rainy days](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWeather/comments/exxyyt/rain_by_%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A0/) (at least artwork of it, perhaps not being stuck in the middle of a big ass rainstorm), and you'll find a *lot* of that here. Along with all other sorts of weather too, whether it be [clear skies](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWeather/comments/fjdn92/sunshine_birds/), [not so clear skies](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWeather/comments/fccwdu/spectrum_by_jeffrey_smith/), [thunderstorms](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWeather/comments/faqu2l/a_peaceful_thunderstorm/), or any other type of weather that you can think of.

This sub is exclusively about weather *artwork*, not pictures of weather, which helps to differentiate it from other subs in a similar vein (that are all still cool, check out /r/raining!). If you enjoy art and/or weather, I would highly recommend this subreddit!


/r/ImaginaryWeather is part of the expansive [Imaginary Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork/wiki/networksublist), a large collection of subs that have the same style of imaginary reality content. If you enjoy the posts in this sub, I would highly recommend checking out some others in the link provided!

Dwarves are a man's romance. They're thick, they're muscular, they're gruff, and they have one thing all men want...

###GIANT BEARDS.

That's right. You know what we're here for. Show us the beards. Show us the bushy glory of a dwarf's face-born destiny. Show me Thorin, Thrain, Thror. Show me Gimli. Show me dwarves in armor, dwarves in leather, dwarves in cloth, and dwarves so fucking great that it makes the wimpy elves cower in fear. Fear of their mighty beards.

ImaginaryDwarves is a subreddit in the Imaginary Network. It has one thing only: Pictures of big, bushy, bearded dwarves. Dwarves with axes, hammers, maces, and big tankards of ale.

The men are men. The women are men. The babies are men.

I love dwarves. If you love dwarves, too, then this is the place for you.

**6.2k** members for  **6 years!** 

[/r/worldpowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers) started out in March 2014 as an experiment by a few high school students to play what amounts to ""RISK"" on Reddit. At its core, it's a cross between a collaborative writing project and a geopolitical simulation game, with a focus on roleplay. Despite its humble roots, it has grown considerably and spawned a genre of Reddit games referred to by the community as ""xPowers"", with dozens of similar games set in different periods of history and hundreds of players across the Reddit-wide xPowers community.

We're on our seventh 'season' right now, with the eighth approaching quickly. The game starts in the current year, and usually runs until 2050-2070 before players begin to lose interest, at which point we reset the map back to the modern day to allow for new storylines and interesting situations to emerge. Players lay claim to countries, independence movements, or other groups whose diplomatic interactions they wish to play out on the world stage, and the game is played through both inter-player interaction as well as internal politics, modelling the situation within your country and using it to create interesting storylines that the rest of the community can enjoy. It's a bit like Model United Nations crossed with Dungeons and Dragons - and the hands-off nature of the moderation allows for practically unlimited possibilities.

Players do everything from [simulated wars](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/fnflyy/conflict_war_plan_fate_14/) to [internal politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/f4im4z/event_slightly_late_nominees_for_2047/) to [dealing with internal crises](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/fubdyu/event_save_the_bay/) and [shockingly in-depth pieces of fictional technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/endrnz/secret_boeing_f38_sparrowhawk/). The commitment and high-quality writing demonstrated by members of our community is surprising, and a fantastic thing to see. The possibilities are limitless, and whether you're interested in military history, geopolitics, or just writing in general, [/r/worldpowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers) allows you to interact in a fun and dynanmic way with other players and the world in general.

**44.2k** members for **6 years!** 

Have you ever seen those popular posts with all those awards and yearned for that glorious Reddit Gold yourself, but no matter how hard you tried you never managed to get it? /r/GoForGold might be your answer!

/r/GoForGold is a subreddit based around challenges for which various Reddit awards, including Gold, obviously, are given as a reward. Challenges can be posted by anyone and can be about ANYTHING. Posts can be anything from art challenges to finding information to codes to crack. I'm sure there will be something that you are able to do!

I had an interview with some of the moderators. Here are some of their responses.

>#1. Why did you get involved with the subreddit? 
    
>>**puhleez420**  I was tired of seeing low quality challenges and the spammy type posts that clogged the sub and felt like it would be a fun challenge to help get the sub back to what it was supposed to be.
    
>>**amdrag20**  I got involved when the subreddit first was created almost six years ago, I just happened to be in the askreddit thread where the idea was incepted. I joined and did a handful of the challenges that were first posted. As /u/Kvothealar mentioned, eventually, the subreddit kinda died off when the challenges stopped being fun. When there was an opportunity to step in as a moderator, I thought it would be good to give back to a community that I once had so much fun participating in.
    
>>**Curlaub**  I got into the sub because I was very active on it in the old days. After a while, it was taken over by cheap crap posts and the fun and interesting challenges faded away. It made me sad and I always kinda wished the sub could get back to what it used to be. Over the years, I would pop in now and then to see how it was doing and I was always disappointed. One day I stopped in and saw someone offering up a reward if someone would apply to be a mod and fix the sub. I had gotten tired of seeing all the meta posts complaining and I've always believe in fixing problems rather than idly whining about them, so Challenge Accepted. I applied to be a mod, was accepted, and set to work.

>#2. What's moderating the sub like? What are the best and worst parts?
    
>>**puhleez420**  Best part is seeing the generosity of our members. I love to see the giving nature of people here. Worst part, the tired joke of ""if you give me gold, I'll give you silver"" hardy har har.
    
>>**amdrag20**  Moderating the sub can be challenging sometimes only because people hear about the subreddit and (a lot of the time) think it’s just a place to get free gold or have someone do a menial task for them. The spirit of the subreddit is so much more than that, it’s about having fun, being creative and, occasionally, have a bit of luck. The best parts of this sub are definitely all the creative things we see.
    
>>**Curlaub**  Honestly, it makes me a little guilty. Shortly after setting things in motion, my wife and I had our first baby and that was time consuming. She stopped working so i got a second job, also time consuming. Then I realized I can't support a family on my current income so now I'm back in college, time consuming. I feel bad and sometimes I feel like I've abandoned my team. I have been making more of an effort lately to respond on discord when pinged and to check in on the sub now and then, but for the most part, I'm grateful to have a team who I can trust to carry on the torch. The best parts are when people say positive things about the sub or its members. I remember when the sub was flooded with negativity and hate. To see that it's come so far that people not only appreciate what the mods do, but even other active members, it makes it feel like a much more friendly and welcoming atmosphere that it used to be. The worst parts are the trolls and people who try to manipulate the rules for their own selfish reasons. This is inherently a very generous and fun-loving community and that behavior is the antithesis of what we are aiming for.

>#3. What are some of your favorite challenges on the sub?
    
>>**puhleez420**  I really like the challenges that have charitable contributions and kindness involved. The Reddit Roulette challenge has been great fun, got a ton of people involved and has been my favorite to date.
    
>>**amdrag20**  Some of my favorite challenges are the ones that just happen to fall into place. As mentioned, the recent Russian roulette community challenge was one that we thought up one night in our discord chat and, within 24 hours, had the challenge worked out and posted. It was absolutely a tonne of fun.
    
>>**Curlaub**  Anything involving spicy foods. I love spicy food and in the old days, if anyone put up a challenge involving a ghost pepper or anything like that, I was all over. The hottest thing I ever ate for the sub was a Trinidad Moruga Scorpion. I love when spicy challenges go up. I also love challenges that push people to develop skills or improve themselves in new ways. While I love what the sub is, I love the idea that it can be something more. Something that not only entertains us, but pushes us to be better people.

>#4. Do you have any plans for the sub in the future?
    
>>**puhleez420**  Keep things excellent and find new ways to get the members involved
    
>>**amdrag20**  We are constantly spit-balling ideas for challenges. We have a channel on our discord for that, too, where members of the community can give challenge ideas if they don’t have the coins to back it (can you tell I’m a fan of of our Discord?). We don’t really want to give too many details away, because part of the fun is the surprise!
    
>>**Curlaub**  Due to my hectic schedule, my plans for the future are to trust the mod team.

>#5. Anything else you want to add?
    
>>**amdrag20**  I want to add that this community is more than just about getting free gold, it’s the members that make it such a great corner of Reddit!
    
>>**Curlaub**  https://tenor.com/view/goldmember-austin-power-love-gold-gif-7399681

**374,585** Marxist-Leninists *posting dark jokes* for **6 years!**  
  
/r/darkjokes is a communist subreddit based on the eternal science of Marxism-Leninism based on the revolutionary philosophy of dialectical materialism. It also has a side gig of posting dark jokes, I guess.  
  
[But what is a ""dark joke""?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN25ghkfgQA)
  
The first result on to this query on Google is a Quora question to which the answer is ""a dark humour joke is a joke which directly harms a society, a colour, or a race"", which is a shit answer. As luck would have it, the infinitely wise Reddit mods have given us a better definition in their sidebar: ""Dark jokes are jokes that employs farce and morbid humor, which, in its simplest form, is humor that makes light of subject matter usually considered taboo."" Like most subreddits dedicated to dark jokes on this God-awful site, posts range from actually amusing and clever to ""haha n word very funni"". My personal favourite post on the subreddit is this slam poetry masterpiece: [""Please Stop, AutoMod""](https://np.reddit.com/r/darkjokes/comments/fjumjk/please_stop_automod/). It was so good the mods removed it. :(  
  
Luckily for us, in a world of low-effort posts, the dedicated mods set the subreddit on the correct path every so often by enforcing methods some have called ""inspired"" and ""killing the subreddit"".  
  
If you head to the subreddit's comments at the moment, you will notice a lot of the comments are removed and the ones that aren't end with a certain phrase. This is the newest iteration of the mods' path correction, and is the celebration of Women's History Month. For this month only (as far as I know), users have to sign their comments with ""Women's history is our history"" or it will be *removed*. This, thankfully, went down very well with the users who were [appreciative for an opportunity to highlight the contributions of women to events in history](https://i.redd.it/s9ef3drml4n41.png). A couple of other successful examples include when [mods banned English characters in order to pay homage to the glorious People's Republic of China 中华人民共和国](https://www.reddit.com/r/darkjokes/comments/d1rv2u/rdarkjokes_%E7%8F%BE%E5%9C%A8%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8Brdarkjokes_now_supports_china/), or when [threads with ""black"" in the title were locked to keep white people (who smell like marbles) from commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/darkjokes/comments/9c7fhm/black/).  
  
I wanted to get the chance to talk to the great mods myself, so after some tense negotiations with the People's Republic of China, I managed to get an exclusive interview with some of the minds behind my favourite Marxist-Leninist subreddit.   
  
>#1. How did you come to mod /r/darkjokes? (and how would you like to be introduced)  

>>**/u/Bromada (the tallest mod of the sub)** I asked GoA and they gave me mod  
  
>>**/u/Six6Sicks (please do introduce me as the sole black moderator, I want the users to know about my condition)** I asked GoA, and am more or less their endentured servant from now until the end of my life.  
  
>>**[Anonymous moderator:](https://youtu.be/kaWYxPbf9S0) (We are not publishing this person's username as they wanted to remain anonymous. [SROTD reserves the right to publish their identity](https://i.redd.it/5udmlpyyno7z.jpg))** I was added by the shadowy cabal of reddit moderators whose name we dare not speak. Seriously, I don't recall who added me; it's been a while. It's a great mod team and I find myself endlessly amused by the creativity of my co-mods.  
  
>>**/u/Meepster23** The sinister Cabal. Not the Jewish or the gay cabal.. THE Cabal..  
  
>>**/u/metastasis_d** My good friend Sooz added me to help integrate me into the cabal.  

>>**/u/Umbresp (a fellow mod of SROTD so they're my favourite)** I clicked a link for free vbucks but it just made me a mod here instead.  
  
>>**/u/TheNewPoetLawyerette** [After sharing that there was a 100 page word document detailing what a terrible mod I am,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tY-ogb8ajBJMYI5YESd-W2yIlRHq64rLDA09-aM04eQ/edit) I recieved the signal from awkwardtheturtle that my efforts at moderation had been noticed by the cabal, and it was believed I could ascend into their ranks. Modding here is no doubt a hazing ritual before I am embraced into this secret society, at which point I hope to learn the dark arts of karma whoring in its purest form.  
  
>#2. What's the upsides and downsides of moderating a subreddit such as /r/darkjokes?  
  
>>**/u/Umbresp** Ups: there are a lot of mod things to do. Downs: no vbucks  
  
>>**/u/Bromada**  this is funny but inconvenient the users reported one of my posts for self harm and it caused the reddit auto response  
  
>>**/u/metastasis_d** The upside is it's a free for all and there's no end of the bigot salt. The downside is it's a silly place. No wait that's also an upside.  
  
>>**/u/Meepster23** I get Soros bux. Downside? The share blue money dried up.  
  
>>**/u/Six6Sicks** The Funny's are always cool to see. No downsides, none at all. 
  
>>**/u/TheNewPoetLawyerette** Upsides: There's a never-ending amount of racist, sexist, homophobic chuds who are mask-off for me to ban. Downsides: see upsides  
  
>>**Anonymous moderator:** The upside to modding r/darkjokes? The modmail. The downside? The modmail.  
  
>#3. Favourite post?   

>>**Anonymous moderator:** I don't have a favorite post because the jokes are all fairly awful.  
  
>>**/u/TheNewPoetLawyerette** probably a dead baby joke that's on its 100th repost.    
  
>>**/u/metastasis_d** I dunno I'm just here for the fun  
  
>>**/u/Six6Sicks** currently removed  
  
>>**/u/Bromada** currently removed  
  
>>**/u/Meepster23** [removed]  
  
>>**/u/Umbresp** What   
  
>#4. Is women's history our history?   

>>**/u/Bromada**  Women's history is our history  
  
>>**/u/Six6Sicks** lol(women's history our history)  
  
>>**/u/Umbresp** You mean women's **her**story?  
  
>>**/u/metastasis_d** Only a misogynist would ask such a question. In all seriousness, though, ""women's history"" is often framed in school as some kind of separate entity from ""regular history"" and it shouldn't be, but circumstances necessitate that it is.  
  
>>**/u/TheNewPoetLawyerette** truth be told I take issue with this statement as it is framed from the male perspective. It's really only appropriate as a catchphrase in men-only feminist spaces, and while I appreciate the men who want to be feminist allies, at the end of the day men will always be imperfect allies by nature of being men, so 'men-only feminist space"" is an oxymoron. However I am confident that exactly 100% of our userbase is straight cis white men, most likely teenagers, so this crass surface-level feminism will suffice for now. Nobody becomes radicalized overnight.      
  
>>**/u/Meepster23** Frankly I'm insulted you would even ask this question. This is the type of overly emotionally charged question that has gotten this country so far off the rails. We have something as vast as the universe being reduced to a simple ""question"" like there is some sort of answer that could possibly satisfy it. Galaxies come into existence and wink back out like you can't even imagine. Truly it saddens me to think of the poor individuals out there without enough brain power to even comprehend this much less pose such a question. Simply put, this whole line of questioning is shallow, pedantic, and more than a bit reductionist.   
  
>>**Anonymous moderator:** Of course women's history is our history. Everyone on earth got here via a woman.

**31,488** members for  **7 days!**

******

COVID19, also known as coronavirus, has affected us a lot. Stores and schools get closed, meetings and events get canceled, people stay at their homes when being in quarantine or not. By now, there have been over 280,000 cases of COVID19 infections, and it's still growing. If I calculated it correctly, about 0.003% of the people in the world have been infected with COVID19. What if you would be one of them?

/r/COVID19positive is a subreddit for posting stories, experiences, vents, questions or discussions about COVID19 and its patients. You don't have to be positive on COVID19 to post there, as you are able to discuss, as an example about telling that you are having early symptoms, asking experiences of COVID19 patients or rants and stories how people deal with COVID19 in the public or in your family.

Despite the small number of subscribers, the sub is pretty busy, as it gets a lot of new posts regularly. How has this affected moderation? We asked three questions from the moderators arham_sarawgi, S1nisterDuck and Succulentlittleboi.


>#1. You've had an incredible growth on the sub. How has that impacted how you moderate the sub? 
    
>>**arham_sarawgi**:  I'd say the rapid growth of this sub really has changed the way we moderated this subreddit, and since we went from 100 to about 20000 users in just about 3 to 4 days meant that we didn't have a lot of time to get things quite right, which meant a lot of disagreeing between us mods as well.

>>**S1nisterDuck**:  It’s crazy that we got 5,000 members in 3 days then we got on trending subreddit of the day and now we’re booming.

>>**Succulentlittleboi**:  With the growing subreddit, we’ve had to make a lot of changes and adjustments to find what was right. But these changes are for the better
    
>#2.  What's the best thing about moderating r/COVID19positive? And what's the worst? 

>>**arham_sarawgi**:  The best thing, for me, has definitely been seeing so many different users come together and help out a fellow human being in this time of crisis where we all are seeking help and guidance from each other. The worst thing is the usual stuff that comes up when a subreddit gains traction, so dealing with all the bots, trolls and other people who just want to make life difficult even in these days.

>>**S1nisterDuck**:  The best thing is Just modding content and being with the nice community, and the worst thing is dealing with full mod queues which I hate

>>**Succulentlittleboi**:  The best part of moderating r/COVID19Positive is the moderators and the people in it. They are all very friendly. There really isn’t a bad part of the subreddit.

>#3.  Do you have any plans for the future of the sub? 

>>**arham_sarawgi**:  Well we certainly hope that this coronavirus pandemic situation calms down as soon as possible, but if that's not the case, we will be making some major changes to the way this subreddit is currently used, so it will be more organized in the days going forward and we have already started to work on that, it's just yet to be implemented.

>>**S1nisterDuck**:  3. Not many at the moment.

>>**Succulentlittleboi**:  Some plans are to continue to grow the subreddit and add more features to it. Also to have some more accessibility for the members.


One special thing about this subreddit is the insane growth of it since it was created only 7 days ago. The moderators there do really good work keeping the subreddit's posts and comments following the sub's rules. The sub is very interesting and I recommend to test out the sub and join the discussions, or at least read a few posts. As someone who hasn't experienced the virus yet, the posts there are really interesting.


**Here are some posts from r/COVID19positive:**

• [Fully stocked. No lines. No panic. No problem.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/fl1mgi/fully_stocked_no_lines_no_panic_no_problem/)

**104,027** readers for **1 Month**

----

By now we've all heard about the *Coronavirus*, or *COVID-19*, and chances are a good number of us are hunkered down, practicing ""Social Distancing"". But in the age of modern media, it can be hard to get the right information you need, especially when it comes to a topic like this.

Enter /r/COVID19: a subreddit specifically designed to facilitate **scientific discussion** regarding the virus.

And when I say *scientific discussion*, I mean it. Just look at the post flairs on the subreddit! There's [Academic Reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fl8i2x/estimating_clinical_severity_of_covid19_from_the/), [Clinical Information](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjj8yb/chinese_guideline_for_corona_virus_treatment_and/), and [AMA's with Experts](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/f9dbeq/covid19_what_do_we_have_to_fear_from_a_pandemic/) just to name a few. Even the moderators are knowledgeable in this field, with nurses and virologists among them. 

The subreddit's sidebar is filled with useful links, including things like a [Real-Time Tracker](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/f6ad0988-f203-45f8-8d18-5d726c1d2d8b/page/MGzDB) and an [Interactive Comparison between COVID-19 and other viruses](https://coronainfo.xyz/)!

The rules of the subreddit certainly help reinforce this focus on science, as they provide guidelines to keep discussions on track, including emphasizing the use of reliable sources, not sensationalizing titles, or even just avoiding unsourced speculation.

----

The moderation team over at /r/COVID19 were kind enough to take time out of their busy schedules to answer a few questions regarding their subreddit.

>#1. Why did you start the subreddit?  

>> The sub was started the day that the WHO announced the official name for the disease – COVID19. There was already /r/Coronavirus, which is focused more on general news and cases so we wanted to start this sub to make it a bastion for scientific discussion and news in relation to the novel coronavirus, in which there was no sub available at the time to fill the need.

>#2. You've had some incredible growth over the past month. How has that impacted how you moderate the sub?  

>> It has been challenging, to say the least. While it hasn’t been as crazy as the growth in /r/Coronavirus, we are proud that our scientific sub recently surpassed 85K subscribers. __*__

>#3. I see there are several other Coronavirus related subreddits out there. What sets /r/COVID19 apart?  

>> COVID19 is a sub dedicated solely to the questioning and discussion of coronavirus research on a scientific level – here we have strict rules on what can be posted, and the types of conversations we wish to encourage.

>#4. Do you have any plans for the future of the sub?  

>> No real plans per se, we just want to maintain it at the state it is currently in – namely, a place for scientific discussion of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and it’s associated disease (COVID19)

>#5. Are there any common myths or theories you'd like to address?

>> The two most common myth we run into is that the virus is somehow vaguely related to HIV and that it is an engineered bioweapon. The first myth stems from a study so bad we hesitate to call it even a study, much less science. However, because of this ""study"", users are now left worrying that SARS-CoV-2 remains in the cells like HIV, attacks the immune system directly like HIV, and/or is a Franken-virus that has been engineered as a hybrid with HIV (it’s not).

>> The second myth is users worry that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered as a bioweapon (it’s not), so this outbreak has represented an ample opportunity to educate the public on how viruses evolve and transmit to humans from non-human animals.

----

###__*__ Writer's Note

I'm not kidding when I said they've had some incredible growth. Take a look at the charts on [SubredditStats.com](https://subredditstats.com/r/covid19)! When I first reached out to the mods at /r/COVID19 a little over a week ago, they had just past 50,000 readers. By the time they got back to me a few days ago, they passed 85,000 readers.

Hell, in the time it's taken me to write this feature, it's already jumped up by another 2,000!

Just goes to show that a lot of people are concerned with this public health issue. I hope you and yours stay safe.

Wash your hands, and be good people!

Have you ever read a sentence and wondered if anyone has ever said that before? No? Just me? Ok...

Anyway, r/brandnewsentence is a sub for sentences that have never been written before. Have you ever heard anyone call polar bears sensationalist propaganda? Have you ever heard anyone mention a quarantini? Or have you ever thought that IKEA bags should be used to restrain angry swans? Me neither. If any of that sounds funny to you, then r/BrandNewSentence might be your new favorite sub!

I got to have an interview with u/bean9914, one of the mods of this sub. Here are some of their responses:

>#1. Why did you join the subreddit as a moderator?
    
>>**bean9914**  I joined because in late 2018 because there was a shortage of mods.

>#2. What's moderating the sub like? What are the best and worst things about it?
    
>>**bean9914**  Pretty okay, actually! We have a lot of reposts, but there's a bot for that now. Possibly not a fan of the whole politics drama that pops up from time to time, but whatever ¯\(ツ)/¯ .

>#2. Do you have any plans for the sub in the future?
    
>>**bean9914**  I don't really have any plans, really. Some of the other mods are trying to set up a discord server?
    
u/bean9914 listed this post as one of his favorites from the sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/BrandNewSentence/comments/diu365/julius_in_the_coolius/

**382,184** futurists for **11 years!**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ever since continually evolving and changing technology has been prevalent, we’ve always been captivated by the thought of large, magnificent (and often very wrong) fantasies of what the future could hold for us. Whether it be Fashion, Cars, Music, Technology or any number of things, this subreddit captures those dreams perfectly, and showcases artwork and other works of fiction based around the concept of “What will the future be like?”, but with a sliiight twist; it’s artwork from (or inspired by!) the Retro view of the Future.

Confused? Take a look at a post like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroFuturism/comments/7mmyo8/we_all_live_in_a_yellow_airplane/), which shows a large, wacky vehicle, which was once speculated to be the Future of travel and general life.

You might recognize this type of media as Futurism, specifically from the retro time of the 30's-80's, which is the style of Futurism this subreddit attempts to capture and showcase, hence the name ‘RetroFuturism.’


I’d like to share some of my favourite posts from this subreddit, such as [This One](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroFuturism/comments/6z0q33/facetime_in_the_1930s/), which shows a prediction of Video Calling all the way back in the ’**30s**! Or [this image](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroFuturism/comments/c7kx68/1980s_soviet_laptop_prototype/), which shows a Soviet Prediction of a current-day laptop. Another favourite of mine is [a video from the ‘60s](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroFuturism/comments/du9k31/educational_film_from_1967_predicts_the_tech_we/) which has a scarily accurate prediction of modern technology.

Personally, I've always loved this type of artwork and media. It perfectly displays the once vibrant, eccentric and hopeful view of the Future, which I think is quite interesting to look back upon with a modern perspective. 
If you have even a slight interest in this sort of thing, I'm certain r/RetroFuturism is perfect for you!

r/abruptchaos is a subreddit devoted to bringing you and showing you the rapid chaos which can occur in any seemingly innocent video. You’ll start off your day by watching a mailman doing their daily rounds but that’s not where it ends, a bear comes and joins him as he continues, without any fear of being eaten. 

The community of r/abruptchaos specialises in finding the videos no one else thought existed. There is fresh content from all corners of the globe, all walks of life, all times of the day. This content comes together and is stored within the community. The community is the heart of r/abruptchaos, identifying problems for the moderators to improve on help and keeping all posts fresh and appropriate to the name. This community dedication assists in maintaining the hilarity which comes from the chaos which you never see coming. 

For those who want a taste of what is to be found on r/abruptchaos, some of the gems have been correlated below:

[Tokyo Drift](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbruptChaos/comments/eod6b5/tokyo_drift/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Additionally, I had a chance to talk to the Master of Chaos, u/StaticNationn and get their answers to a few questions. 

> **Why did you choose to create this subreddit?**
I actually didn't create the subreddit. The original creator of the subreddit became inactive with the community so I asked to take it over. I took it over because I genuinely liked the community and its posts. I wanted to take on the task of creating a great and funny community and I think I've accomplished that goal very well.

>**What is the best part about moderating this subreddit?**
For me, the best part about moderating /r/AbruptChaos, is that whenever I approve/remove posts I always find enjoyment in the videos posted. They make me smile. And to me, moderating a subreddit should be about fun, and I can confidently say that /r/AbruptChaos definitely fulfills that.

>**What is the most abruptly chaotic post you have seen?**
The most abruptly chaotic post I have personally seen is https://www.reddit.com/r/AbruptChaos/comments/dcwu92/im_so_confused/ So much just happens in one video. Why did the man kick his butt? Why did he even initiate if he was just going to run away in fear? Is that guy in the background drunk? Why is he celebrating so hard? Did he get a strike? Why did the second guy at the end just come walking up without waiting for his buddy to finish? Why did he bring his arm all the way to the back of his head with the bowling ball in it? There's just so much to comprehend about this video and it happens all at once. I think that's what makes it truly abruptly chaotic.


>**Is there anything else you’d like to add about the subreddit?**
If you're into abrupt chaos, mostly in a funny way, you'll love our subreddit. It has a ton of variety and it's constantly being moderated to ensure the subreddit stays true to its nature. :)

**105,773** *GangControl Followers* for **3 years**!

&nbsp;

Alright, I think I've cracked it. That which no man has ever been able to do before. If my calculations are correct, then this feature will be posted on Friday the 13th. I've spent years upon years working on this, looking at every post /u/GangControl has made, trying to find a pattern. I went to the smartest scientists in the world to try and find answers, and none of them could help. They said I was mad for even trying it. Everyone knows that there's only one being in the universe that can know the date and the day. And perhaps I am mad. I've poured millions of dollars into this hole, hoping that something came up. And one day, something did.

I was in my kitchen, making a cup of tea for myself. I would often do this, if only to give myself an excuse to take a short break from my research for my sanity's sake; I don't even like tea. I poured the boiling water into the cup, put the teabag in. No sugar, I ain't no bitch. A drop of milk. I took the teabag, and as I went to the bin, I spotted something, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to the fridge, and I saw it. It was a piece of paper, showing some kind of table, with 7 columns and 6 rows. I wasn't sure what I was looking at at first, but years of research had trained my ability to see patterns and to know when something was up. Without even thinking, my eye found its way to one of the columns; it had the letters ""Fri"" above it. What could it mean? I puzzled over this for a few seconds, and then, it happened. Like GangControl himself was guiding me to the answer, I looked down the column, and there it was.

A little square with the number ""13"" in it.

My mind went blank. I dropped the teabag, now considerably more dried up than when it had been removed from that cup all those minutes before. I hardly even noticed. I couldn't comprehend what I was seeing. Was this the answer? After all these years? It couldn't be, I thought. Yet as I stood there, it all came into place in my mind, like an orchestra coming to the end of a piece. The cryptic clue at the top of the column. The number 13. As if something else was in control of my hands, they went and grabbed this sacred manuscript off of the fridge, the little magnet in the shape of a dolphin that had been holding it up, falling to the floor to rest along with the old teabag. It had multiple pages, and each of them has the same layout. 7 columns, 5 rows. Wait, only 5 rows? Indeed, it seemed that it was inconsistent. 3 of the pages had 6 rows, while the other 9 had 5 rows. This was something to be investigated later, and I put the thought in the back of my mind. As I hurried back to my laboratory, my feet came out from beneath my. That darn teabag was slippery. As I fell though, it was as if time slowed down. Underneath the counter, in the little basket where the plastic bags went, there was what looked to be another one of these manuscripts. I had little time to process it before I collided with the floor, however. As I stood up, slightly dazed, I stumbled over to the basket and grabbed this sacred text out from under all the plastic bags and tea towels. Yes, it was the same thing! There was one difference though, for on the front of this text was the number 2019. The other one had had the number 2020 on the front of it. What could it all mean? I would research it later on. I grabbed both of the texts, careful not to cause any damage to these priceless artefacts, and took them to my research lab.

Gingerly setting them down on the table next to the stacks of papers that contained the fruit of my life's labour, I pulled up the page that had been confounding scholars for years. /r/IsTodayFridaythe13th. My fingers glided across the keyboard with an urgency they had never had before. I pulled up every known Iota event documented (this what the classification used for a predicted Friday the 13th). Looking at the dates of each one, I noticed something different about them, a pattern that I'd never seen before. They all occurred on the same date. The 13th. Could it be that a Friday the 13th could only happen on the 13th day of each month? It couldn't be true, I thought. Pressing on, I went to the previous 2 events that had both occurred in the same year; a much celebrated event, to be sure. They had happened on [September](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsTodayFridayThe13th/comments/d3ozdj/is_today_friday_the_13th/) and [December](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsTodayFridayThe13th/comments/ea43ab/is_today_friday_the_13th/) of 2019 respectively. Wait. 2019! The number on the manuscript! It was all happening too fast for me to document it, I was on the trail now. I took the little booklet and flicked to the ninth page, and there it was. Right in the ""Fri"" column. The number 13. The book was right.

I don't remember much of what happened after that. The first clear memory I have is from back in the psych ward, the usual bed. In the few seconds of consciousness as the doctors stood over me, I was only able to get one word out before drifting back into unconsciousness.

""Darn.""




&nbsp;

*****

&nbsp;

Not much has happened since then. I was released from the psych ward again, they gave me the usual meds. I never took them, they interfered with my research. They were obviously only giving them to me to medicate me into submission, they were afraid of me finding the truth. They didn't know how close I'd gotten. When I returned to my house the manuscripts were gone, along with much of my research. I had it all stored in my mind though, it was only a minor setback.

It's been 2 months since then. The day is March the 12th as I write this. Tomorrow, the day you read this, we will all find out the truth. If I am wrong, then I don't know what I will do. If I am correct, then... /u/GangControl help us. Perhaps there'll even be another Friday the Thirteenth after, to celebrate. Only /u/GangControl can know for certain.

r/wholesome is a 5 year old community, which only really properly opened  in June this year after a successful reddit request. The previous mods had the sub set on restricted, so in the space between when the sub was created and June this year, no one was able to submit content. We thought the sub had potential to be a competitor to similar subs like r/MadeMeSmile, r/HumansBeingBros etc.  
  
The subreddit is pretty self explanatory, it’s a sub where any wholesome content is allowed to be posted. We didn’t really want to be super strict in regards to what content would be allowed since we did want to grow the sub before we thought about restricting certain content. Think of it as a “more free” r/MadeMeSmile and the like.
  
Here's some examples:  
  
[McDonald’s had a campaign to help kids with cancer using a portion of the money they got from Big Mac’s, BK steppes back to help them achieve their goal.

[Wholesome Christmas]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesome/comments/d1jfuu/wholesome_christmas/)  
  
r/wholesome is the place for content that makes you smile. Whether that be someone who would inspire others, or a human doing something kind for another human. Basically any content that makes the viewer feel good, is allowed.

JapaneseFeed shares one Japanese vocabulary word every hour along with an English translation. We provide vocabulary words on a regular basis to help motivate language learners to continue practicing and improving.

JapaneseFeed is a spin-off of the subreddit /r/Word_of_The_Hour. Community members from Word of The Hour volunteered many hours manually adding Japanese translations so that we could create this subreddit. All of our Japanese vocabulary words and translations come from the great efforts of our volunteers.

We welcome contributors from all countries and communities. See here for more information on how to contribute: https://www.reddit.com/r/Word_of_The_Hour/comments/95v7rk/we_need_your_help_help_us_improve_our_translations/

It is important to keep in mind that word to word translations are not perfect. We encourage community members to share additional information such as corrections, clarifications, and alternative translations in the comments. We are always happy to connect and welcome you to join our community!

The content is amazing because it is crowd-sourced by the community members and because it teaches people how to write new words in Japanese.

For example, the community members showed how to write Dolphin, Accept, and Autumn (see below). Dolphin is a fun word while Accept and Autumn are practical words that you might commonly use in writing.

Dolphin: https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFeed/comments/f8hkd1/word_of_the_hour_%E6%B5%B7%E8%B1%9A_%E3%81%84%E3%82%8B%E3%81%8B/

With the last few years we have seen the rise of wholesome memes. For those unaware at to what these sorts of memes are, those can be defined (*by /r/WholesomeMemes*) using four major categories:

1. A meme that subverts a generally negative meme to be more positive, often showcasing genuine human emotion.

2. A meme that promotes health or well-being of body, mind, and/or soul

3. A meme that is pure of heart, devoid of corruption or malice, modest, stable, virtuous, and all-around sweet and compassionate

4. A meme that conveys support, positivity, compassion, understanding, love, affection, and genuine friendship by re-contextualizing classic meme formats, and using them to display warmth and empathy

So if that's what a wholesome meme is, then what's a swolesome meme? Well, it's pretty much the same as a wholesome meme, but featuring buff and burly dudes!

In fact, there's even a [**meta swolesome meme**](https://www.reddit.com/r/swolesomememes/comments/drhhgd/kings_i_found_some_swolesome_meta/) which explains why some find this format to be funny!

Whether it's reminding you to keep your head up, correcting toxic behavior, or even helping a first-year student with a lecture recording from your *Nvidia GeForce Experience*, there's a swolesome meme out there that can brighten your day!

----

I recently had a chat with one of the subreddit's moderators, **/u/awkwardtheturtle**, to ask him some questions about /r/SwolesomeMemes!

>#1. Do you lift?

>> Of course I lift. Both weights and also the emotions of my friends and family

>#2. Why did you join the subreddit?

>> I joined this subreddit during the dawn of the wholesome movement on reddit. It seemed like a neat place so I added it to the Wholesome Network of subreddits I promote and signed on as a volunteer.

>#3. What's moderating the sub like?

>> Easy peasy lemon squeezy

>#4. What are some of your favourite posts?

>> [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/swolesomememes/comments/ent1kj/weve_all_got_beards_where_it_counts_3/) is my favorite. I remember when that episode first came out. Good times.

>#5. Do you have any future plans for the subreddit?

>> Gonna keep lifting with the fam cuz that is what we do

>#6. Anything else for the record?

>> Raise hell and eat corn bread yee yee

Spotify. Do I need to define what Spotify is? Spotify is a digital music service giving access to millions of songs. However, let's say a new user hops on Spotify without knowing what to listen to. Given the array of options, some would be overwhelmed, but that's exactly where r/Spotify comes in. Mainly for sharing different playlists, r/Spotify is there to allow users to find new music and explore the different ways that people may listen to music. Not only are there tons of playlists, but there are also a bunch of possible things that you should take note of or be careful of when first learning about the app. One example off the top of my head is the fact that gift cards don't work with certain plans, which may mess some people up.

Especially with large communities, it's easy for a bunch of spam to show up, but with simple rules, it makes the subreddit very easy for users to share playlists and find new playlists. I've browsed the subreddit for a good amount of time, and I haven't noticed posts out of place, giving the impression that their moderator team is on top of things. Whether you are new to the service or a veteran, this is a place for everyone to come together and share their own tastes in music for others to enjoy.

Also, the wiki includes a bunch of helpful information, such as FAQ's, technical issues, and even helpful warnings/third-party apps to help out with your experience overall. There's also a third party apps tab dedicated to apps that help out with your experience using the service, and descriptions on what they do and how they help. 

Some of the playlists that I've looked at are -

[Revivalist Psychedelic Rock](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/f9bg2h/you_know_whats_cool_if_you_like_bands_like/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**154,919** members for  **a half of a year!** ^((The subreddit itself was created 8 years ago, but RPAN was announced 6 months ago))

******

There is a big chance you've seen live streaming somewhere on the Internet, or even have streamed by yourself. However, if you completely live under the rock, live streaming is uploading your media online in real-time. Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and many other online services share the feature for their users to live stream. 6 months ago Reddit launched its own live streaming service, [RPAN](https://www.reddit.com/rpan). 

RPAN is a shortening for ""Reddit Public Access Network"" and it's open regularly every Thursday for 7 hours. However, the day might change when the RPAN is on, and it could be extended with being on for even longer than 7 hours. Every eligible Redditor with enough account requirements is able to start their own SFW broadcast on the mobile app. Like normally on Reddit, people are able to comment, upvote or downvote your broadcast, or even give it an award. Broadcasts also include a chat section that's in real-time too.

RPAN has its own subreddit r/pan, which is mostly used for announcements, AMAs, stream archives, questions, suggestions, bug reports and art posts. RPAN moderation team also does weekly AMAs with a chosen streamer so the users can get to know them better.

Reddit administrators are moderating RPAN and the subreddit r/pan. However, there are two normal users in RPAN that moderate the sub and the broadcasts too. These two moderators are u/doradiamond and u/MarioKartGuy27, and we interviewed them.

>#1. What's the best thing about moderating r/pan and RPAN?  
    
>>**doradiamond**:  The best thing about moderating RPAN is the ability to see how creative and inventive our community can be! We do moderate both the subreddit and the broadcasts and it’s been a crazy ride. We get to see people from all walks of life, all over the world, doing the things they love. We’ve had loads of people sharing their pets, users showing us what their jobs are like, lots of musicians and artists displaying their craft, and plenty of crazy folks dressing up as clowns, dancing in gold suits, or exploring haunted houses! On a personal note, it’s been fantastic to get involved in such a unique and exciting new Reddit feature from the beginning. Because the users are not shy about voicing their opinions, it’s pretty cool to see how much the Reddit admins take on board the feedback. Every week, they are making tweaks and fixes to RPAN to constantly improve the experience - it honestly is a great process to be a part of.

>>**MarioKartGuy27**:  I'm pretty green to moderating /r/pan, but so far the community is fairly understanding as a whole when it comes to rules and regulations!
    
>#2. How would you improve RPAN, if you could?  

>>**doradiamond**:  I’d probably work on technical fixes, like ensuring we have a smooth-running platform with zero connectivity and latency issues. The servers can take a while to warm up so the start of each broadcasting session is always a bit bumpy. I’d also like to see RPAN available on weekends. At the moment, because RPAN is still in its early stages, it requires a lot of hands-on monitoring by the Reddit admin team who (understandably) don’t want to work on weekends! However, as the platform grows and becomes more sophisticated, I have no doubt that we’ll see it available in many more timezones. Finally, I’d love to see more diversity of content. I think a lot of this will be achieved once we can have streaming in more timezones and over weekends, but it would be great to see more examples of people in different outdoor settings and exploring their communities.

>>**MarioKartGuy27**:  With the service currently still in alpha stages, there's a lot of room for growth. I think UI changes to better assist users who aren't super tech-savvy but still want to stream would be great!

>#3. What's the most annoying/worst thing about RPAN at the moment?

>>**doradiamond**:  Oh this is a hard one… obviously from a technical perspective, it would be great if Reddit admins were given more time and resources to devote towards refining the platform - but they’re only human! I’ve had to say the attitude towards getting the “most viewers” in streams. 99.9% of our community is amazing, kind and curious individuals. However, we do have some users who (in my opinion) are a bit too focussed on getting as much karma and viewers as possible, and are worrying too much about what others are streaming. I guess it’s a sense of competition that was probably inevitable - after all karma-farming is pretty much a staple of Reddit. However, I think it’s important for users to realise that it doesn’t matter what other people are streaming, how many people are watching them, or how many upvotes they are getting. The RPAN algorithm is constantly switching around who is in the first place in streams, so everyone has an equal chance to get viewers - it’s just up to the users what they want to watch. Instead, panners (that’s what we call our streamers) should just focus on streaming what they love and enjoy. This is a pretty exciting opportunity to share their jobs, adventures, talents with others around the world!

>>**MarioKartGuy27**:  As an Sysadmin, I can imagine for their team of sysadmins there working to keep stability during streaming hours. As a user of the service, mostly just low effort posts, like ""streaming a black screen"".


I was very excited when I first heard about RPAN, as that's something we've never seen before on Reddit. RPAN isn't on air too often, which is the reason it still keeps my interest on it without getting bored. As u/doradiamond said, it's magnificent to see what's the community like and what they're doing all over the world. The RPAN is special, because of its positive and creative community. I've also broadcasted there, which is very interesting and pleasant when people actually join your broadcast. Hop on r/pan and wait until the next RPAN is on air!

**Here are some posts from r/pan:**

**157,785** users with gluey fingers for  **8 Years!** 

----

Building scale models is a hobby enjoyed by people everywhere - ranging from children to retirees. The subreddit /r/ModelMakers is dedicated to these plastic models, and the people who make them! Users are encouraged to post pictures of projects they are working on, or discuss and exchange different tips and techniques!

I am personally attached to this subreddit, as this hobby is something I grew up doing with my father. Even to this day we paint toy soldiers and make model tanks - but it can barely hold a candle to what the users of /r/ModelMakers can do!

I had the opportinuty to talk with one of the moderators, **/u/furrythrowawayaccoun**, to gain some insight on the subreddit.

>#1. Why did you join the subreddit?  

>> I joined the subreddit around 4 years ago, with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/40olbo/my_first_model_im_proud_of_revell_bf_109_g10_172/). It was my first airbrushed kit so I was really excited to show it off and as I recently learned of the subreddit, I thought: why not? While I was really happy how it turned out, I knew I could do better. At first, I was a bit hesitant to post/comment due to my username, but it didn't prove to be a problem at all. Bit by bit, I spent time on the subreddit and I improved quite a bit thanks to tips and the answers to my questions from all the members. On the 5th of March last year, I was invited to join the mod team and I did, so here we are heh.

>#2. What's moderating the sub like?  

>> As I had absolutely no moderating experience, it was a bit tough to learn to be ""a boss"" and when to intervene but I learned to get into the role. Though, I still am learning how to be a better mod. Moderating the subreddit is a good experience, very rarely do I encounter badly behaving people, even fewer rude modellers, so apart from the more-than-occasional Sabaton lyric chain thread and people unable to read rules 5 & 6, it's usually smooth sailing heh


>#3. What are some of your favorite posts?  

>> Hm... well, as a moderator (and the OP heh) my favourite post is the [""New to the hobby"" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/9dhsqo/new_to_model_building_this_thread_is_here_to/) as it has the basic info on more-less everything a new modeller should know/get to get into the hobby.

>> For builds, [u/Gr0gus's extremely well made Tiger](https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/eplfoi/after_6_months_250_hours_my_vision_took_shape/) threads were a real joy to look at. He's currently working on a T-34 from the 2019. movie ""T-34"".

>> I'm also a **huge** fan of groupbuilds, so seeing all the groupbuild posts makes me quite happy. A groupbuild is where a group of people decide to work on a model of a certain theme, usually something that's not orthodox. The most active one is [""Knights of the Sky""](https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/elqknu/groupbuild_announcement_knights_of_the_sky_ww1/), a WW1 airplane themed one.


>#4. Do you have any plans for the future of the sub?  

>> I cannot speak for every mod on this subject, but I wish to expand and finish the wiki so that it can serve new and old modellers alike. I'd also like to work to promote non-profit organisations like [Models for Heroes](https://www.modelsforheroes.co.uk/) as I find their work quite amazing.

>> And as mentioned before, groupbuilds! They're a really awesome tool to bring the community together so that's what I wish to promote and have more of in the future :D

>#5. Anything else to add?  

>> It's never too late to start the hobby! We have members who are 60+ years old and only now took a brush into their hands and are happily modelling away. Sometimes, it feels weird being only 20 and telling someone 2-4 times your age what to do but hey, we're all in this together heh. If I had to give a tip to any new modeller, it would be to **thin your paints**!

**32,471** With brain cells for  **Just Over 1 Year!**

---

There is a large amount of HoldMy____ themed subreddits that have gained popularity over the past couple of years. Whether it be r/holdmybeer featuring drunk people doing drunk things or r/holdmyredbull where people pull off insane stunts these subreddits have always been popular.
  
Created September 24, 2018 r/holdmybraincells has offered Reddit users a community-oriented around content featuring people that could only be described as not having any brain cells, In short, these people behave or perform acts that someone thinking rationally would never do, be it a dangerous stunt that has a small likelihood of success or just getting mixed up in a sticky situation things rarely turn out well for these people. It is a place to laugh after a long day of school or work when you just need to feel a little better about your life and identify together with other users who would never be so stupid as to make the same mistakes portrayed.

Here is an in-depth view as to what r/holdmybraincells is all about.

>#1. What was your inspiration behind creating r/holdmybraincells?

>>**newfoundrapture**-  The idea of the sub really came out of nowhere. I saw a post over on Hold My Cosmo about two years now (Summer 2018) of a [girl shooting a flare out of her window]( https://www.reddit.com/r/holdmycosmo/comments/9ifsl6/hmc_while_i_shot_this_flare_out_the_window/e6jdwz2/ ), which caused the curtains to catch on fire. I wrote ""r/holdmybraincells more like"" (in relation to something being so stupid that it's said you have no brain cells) and that was it. I really didn't think much of the comment, since it was one of those throwaway comments you tend to write then later delete. I happened to get a few notifications on my phone a few hours later and the next thing I knew, was that what I wrote was a sub. I never started investing in it until Winter that year/start of 2019. 

>##2. What was most difficult about growing this subreddit?

>>**newfoundrapture**-  The most difficult part of growing the sub is, investment. But it has to be personal investment, and not just the investment to get people to come into your sub. I grew the subreddit inch-by-inch, and since I had the type of sub that could afford crossposts, I invested heavily in them. I cross-posted everything, and I was posting a lot of the stuff myself (going as far as scouring GIFcat/Imgur on the regular). I was cross-posting things from other subs, until I had at least 50, maybe 80 posts to fatten it up.
The first thing I did was reach out to other Hold My subreddits, and I was so fortunate that r/holdmyfeedingtube (which became a major inspiration since I had no idea what I was doing) offered to put the name in their sidebar. I never actually went the route of posting my subreddit in comments. That felt far too self-promotion-ey to me, and even though that's what I was trying to do -- to get views, to get eyes to look at the posts -- I knew I had to play the long game and just keep investing. Investing in for me. I, at times, got more satisfaction posting something up on my sub and using it as a personal journal or diary. A list of things I saw, that were stupid but funny and putting them on my subreddit to share with others. The people and the subscriptions came last, and I remember a time when getting 20 upvotes on a post was a major, major victory.
I invested about six months until I had a few regulars, the one that deserves a mention is /u/Dan-68 who kept coming back and putting some posts up, then later a few others. Once I had my regulars, I knew I was on the right track, but I kept investing in it, and I decorated it myself, thought it out myself, and had a plan in mind on what I needed to do, and it wasn't until December there that I actually set out to get myself a moderating team involved, and a few days ago, the subreddit became a trending subreddit, which drove us from 16k to 30k nearly overnight.

>3. What unique content does r/holdmybraincells offer its members?

>>**newfoundrapture**- Anything stupid. That's the easiest way that helped me when I was growing it, and the best way I can describe HMBCs is that we're the stupidity that leads to r/holdmyfeedingtube. We're a prequel of sorts. So anything stupid, no matter how absurd, NSFW, no matter how mild and amusing, as long as it's people -- or things, such as animals -- do something stupid and we offer people a place to post those GIFs up and to share. I can't tell you what's my favorite post, though, but I can tell you my favorite TYPE of post we get is the ones that involve people jumping off / over things. It never stops amazing me the lengths people go, only to get hurt, and it could all be stopped if they just said: ""maybe I shouldn't do this"".

People getting hurt isn't for everyone and that is understandable, however, r/holdmybraincells offers users a unique community with content ranging from very family-friendly to a little more serious, and someplace where everyone can have a laugh. The moderation team is very active and responsive, the rules are fair and everyone is allowed to post there. I suggest heading over there and checking out some of the wonderful and very funny content the provide the internet.

Ever heard the old saying ""righty tighty, lefty loosey"" that helps people remember which way to screw or unscrew stuff? 

That's what the aptly named sub /r/RightyTighty is for. The sub is for posting and receiving useful memory hooks and mnemonic devices for remembering various things. Have you ever needed to memorize something but you just couldn't think of an easy way? Then a memory hook is what you need. What if you needed a way to remember, say, [the countries in Central America from north to south](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rightytighty/comments/f6mdip/many_giant_boats_headed_east_for_new_coastal_ports/)? I'm sure you could find it on /r/RightyTighty, and if you couldn't then you could make a post and ask! Have you made your own memory hook? Those can be posted on the sub too.

There have been a large selection of memory hooks posted to the sub over the past 4+ years of it's existence. There's one for [how to remember the difference between stalactites and stalagmites](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rightytighty/comments/f71ejc/tights_come_down_stalactites_vs_stalagmites_also/). There's an easy way to remember [the difference between waxing and waning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rightytighty/comments/f6y760/waxing_vs_waning_moon_waxing_is_maxing_a_waxing/). There's one for [how to remember the stages of cell division](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rightytighty/comments/f73idj/more_than_30_years_later_i_still_remember_the_5/). There's even a memory hook that reminds you how to spell [the word necessary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rightytighty/comments/df7z73/its_necessary_to_wear_a_shirt/). I'll never forget again!

Now that you know about this sub, you'll never have trouble remembering anything again.

Since the beginning of human life, we have called earth our home. For hundreds of thousands of years humans have resided here, and since the dawn of our existence there have been questions asked that still have yet to be answered. Whether they be scientific, supernatural, or just out of the ordinary people have been stumped by these strange happenings.

If your curious about where all this is going I will tell you. Today’s subreddit of the day is r/UnresolvedMysteries where people can share, discuss and contemplate the many questions and confusing events that have perplexed people for years. Whether it is a missing person, a strange image in a crop field, or something far older, while your questions may go unanswered you may find some peace at mind knowing you aren’t the only one unable to solve this unresolved mystery.

Here are some questions proposed to the moderators.

>#1. Why did you start/join this subreddit?

>>**SleekVulpine**-  I didn't start the sub, but my friend was moderating and needed help. I’m already a huge fan of mysteries so it seemed like a good fit.

>##2. What is moderating the sub like?

>>**SleekVulpine**-  Moderating this sub can be tough, I have to look into every reported post to be sure the report is correct. It can also be tough because a lot of the cases are just very sad and it can wear on you reading them from day to day. I do love it though, learning about these cases is so interesting. I especially enjoy learning about mysteries and crimes that are very old, the older the better.

>3. What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**SleekVulpine**-  We had an insanely intriguing post made just recently about [Britney Spears](https://old.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/eswxy2/the_mystery_surrounding_britney_spears). It got so many people talking and it’s really quite a read. Also, I do like seeing well thought about posts about [Elisa Lam](https://old.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/c49zqw/the_simplest_elisa_lam_theory_bear_with_me/), that case never stops making me scratch my head.

Whether it be dark, light, old, or new mysteries never get boring, something that gets your brain working, developing new thoughts and ideas and expressing them to a community that shares similar interests to you can be very rewarding and fulfilling. I suggest you go take a look and read into some of the theories and mysteries that have been presented before you.

"February 20th, 2020 - /r/MemeTemplatesOfficial: Request or submit a meme template!",137,f6v3uu,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/f6v3uu/february_20th_2020_rmemetemplatesofficial_request/,4,"####/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial

**197,056** template enthusiasts for **2 Years!** 

******

r/MemeTemplatesOfficial is the biggest template posting and requesting subreddit that lets people request a meme template or submit a meme template themselves. 

Let's say that you saw a meme that has a very nice, potential, use-able meme template, and would want to use it in your own meme. However, the meme is in a very low-quality format and also has watermarks all over it, so cropping isn't a choice. What should you do? Correct, just visit the sub, post the meme you saw, and give a descriptive title that tells what's happening or who's in the image of the template you are requesting for. If you don't have the meme that has the template you are requesting, you could do a text post and describe it as best as you can in the title. Now, you just have to wait for someone to link the template.

The same thing goes with submitting templates. Post the template and write a descriptive title about it. Writing up a descriptive title helps out other users to find the template whenever trying to use the search bar or simply just Google.

In my opinion, the subreddit is in a pretty good state. The community posts regularly and whenever the post is a request, people help out the original poster to find the template. What do the moderators of the sub think about the sub? We interviewed the subreddit owner u/DankNiBBa, the subreddit administrator u/T4ll0 and the new trial moderator u/sir_spoopy.

>#1. What's the best thing about moderating r/MemeTemplatesOfficial?  
    
>>**DankNiBBa** - I can't name one thing, so I'll name a few. I've met lots of people and good friends from moderating r/MemeTemplatesOfficial. As the founding mod, it was amazing to see the subreddit grow from nothing to a worthy community people actually use, I really can't describe how happy that makes me. This has been nothing but a great experience so far, and I'm hoping we'll place a mark within the meme community. The moderators are people I can trust and count on. I like to think we have a healthy relationship. For the longest time, this subreddit wasn't really being moderated, with the first ""wave"" of mods joining about a year ago. This place has changed drastically since then, and I like to believe this is where r/MemeTemplatesOfficial was more than a random whim, it was something I love and want to dedicate my time into.
    
>>**T4ll0** - Since I joined the moderation team in the subreddit, I've always enjoyed watching and handling the modmails once a Redditor got their post removed, or banned; Not mentioning that in a rude manner, but just looking at how they overreact for a simple ban, usually by not reading the rules before posting. You can spot ban replies from friendly answers, to direct complaints that rarely turns into an actual discussion about the ban. It's weird in my opinion, but honestly, it's the thing I saw as the best part of moderating for how funny it looks like.
    
>>**sir_spoopy** - My favorite thing about being part of the subreddit staff team would have to be interacting with the community as there are some good people that I enjoy talking to daily
    
>##2. What rule is broken the most?  

>>**DankNiBBa** - With no doubt; rule 2, which states that post titles must either name or describe the template that's shared or requested. I don't remember the exact percentage, but a certain moderator of our sub made a chart for all broken rules. The percentage for rule 2 was in the high 90's. 

>>**T4ll0** - The pinned post in the subreddit pretty much sums up everything as it looks like: Breaking rule 2 has been a problem since it was implemented. In fact, 90% of the content in the already mentioned modmail is filled with people complaining about their ban about rule 2. From their point of view, I can understand how they feel when their post got suddenly removed and temporally banned from the subreddit, so I can't blame anyone for the enraged mood. However, this always happens for the banned users by not directly looking at the rules, and post their template/request with the incorrect title there, leading for their subsequent removal from the subreddit. I never enjoyed banning everyone, and I saw it as a rough move since the beginning, but sometimes you've got to learn from the hard way in order to avoid committing such mistakes ever again. Rule 1 and 4 are the other two most broken rules in the subreddit as well, but if we talk about why a karma threshold was implemented in the subreddit, Rule 2 can be referred to as a core factor and the most broken rule in r/MemeTemplatesOfficial history.

>>**sir_spoopy** - The most common rule broken that I have seen would be the rule 2, which is ""no low-effort titles"" 

>3. How has the moderator team handled the situation?

>>**DankNiBBa** - This rule was introduced shortly after the first wave of mods (if I remember correctly) and was originally suggested by a community member. It's changed the subreddit for the better by a huge amount. The mods have done an amazing job at making the subreddit what it is today, with a special mention to u/T4ll0, who has had the greatest impact of them all. The moderators mean a lot to me, really.

>>**T4ll0** - I think the moderation team handles the subreddit quality pretty amazing. The trial mods have been properly doing their job as how it should be. Despite some rule-breaking posts are still out there in late hours, they are usually removed later by other mods in different time zones waking up and check the subreddit soon.

>>**sir_spoopy** - I believe that the current staff team deal with rule-breakers very quickly and effectively as there are times that I will be looking through the sub for about 20 minutes when getting home from school and only see a handful of rule-breakers



As seen from the responses, rule-breaking on this sub happens all the time, as with other subs too. You don't need anything special to join the sub, but having a good knowledge of the rules lets you submit posts freely without having any trouble. It's hard to think about a good title, yeah. But in this sub, it's required to write it well in order that it helps other people to find the template. I've had a good experience myself with the sub, as it has helped me many times to find a good template, and I've also posted templates too. In my opinion, the sub is special because of its helpfulness and potentiality.

Have fun with the sub!

**4,292** victors for **3 Years!**

----

/r/DerScheisser is the unholy crossover between /r/ShitWehraboosSay and /r/HistoryMemes. Marked as a *""completely unserious historical sub""*, it was intended as a place for redditors to share their WWII memes, allowing for actual discussion to take place on /r/ShitWehraboosSay.

For those out of the loop, a *Wehraboo* is defined by the subreddit as:

>Someone with an exaggerated or sanitized view of Nazi Germany's accomplishments or conduct before and during WWII

This often includes (but is unfortunately not limited to):

-	5 Shermans were needed to take out 1 Tiger

-	""If only Hitler had listened to his generals...""

-	Perpetuating the ""Clean Wehrmacht"" myth

While /r/ShitWehraboosSay tends to point out inaccuracies in these topics and often tries to educate readers on the true history, /r/DerScheisser aims to mock them with low effort memes.

----

I recently had a chat with the subreddit's founder and moderator, **/u/MaxRavenclaw**, to ask him some questions about /r/DerScheisser!

>#1. Why did you start the subreddit?

>> At one point, SWS banned shitposts. That's when I got the idea. I liked the memes that used to be posted there and wanted to keep making them, as well as checking out what others came up with, but I understood why the SWS mods decided to disallow them, so I came up with a solution that made everyone happy. I created a new home for them. The motto, ""We Scheißpost so SWS doesn't have to!"", was inspired by the Nostalgia Critic's ""I remember it so you don't have to"".

>#2. What's moderating the sub like?

>>It's pretty relaxed most of the time. I'm happy to say that most of our users are laid back and don't cause trouble. We do have the occasional drama, such as the animeme segregation and the occasional flame war, but DerScheisser isn't a tiresome sub to mod.

>> For anyone interested, the animeme segregation refers to an event when too many anime posts on the sub led to an uproar, which led to the creation of R4, which saw anime shitposting moved to /r/TsundereImperialists. Then there was that time when a user kept getting into particularly lengthy and heated arguments which made many other users believe he was trolling or baiting. This led to the creation of the controversial and often misunderstood R5, which prohibits pointless, unconstructive arguments on what is supposed to be a fun, shitposting sub. Of course, the user didn't stop getting into such arguments, and after giving him a lot of chances I was ultimately forced to drop the ban hammer. This episode repeated with two other users. Now things are more or less calm, though there is some friction between the more left-leaning viktors and those who don't share their views. I fear that this might lead to more drama. We'll see.

>#3. What are some of your favourite posts?

>>Oh, I love so many of the posts there that I fear listing any would do a disservice to the others. But if I must, in no particular order: [One man gets a rifle...](https://www.reddit.com/r/DerScheisser/comments/9p6a0g/one_man_gets_a_rifle/), [SWS said to post this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DerScheisser/comments/dk15vi/sws_said_to_post_this_here/), [I couldn’t help but share this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DerScheisser/comments/7q9rx4/i_couldnt_help_but_share_this/). I also love meta posts: [this one about the animeme segregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DerScheisser/comments/9fg1l8/the_trash_bin_is_now_open_a_visual_aid/) and [a flame war](https://www.reddit.com/r/DerScheisser/comments/ao7of2/state_of_the_sub_these_days/).

>#4. Do you have any future plans for the subreddit?

>>Simple: Deal with trouble as it comes up and keep the shitposts coming.

>#5. Anything else for the record?

>>Thank you to our shitposters in general for keeping the sub great, alive, and just overall being such a cool crowd, and to you in particular for covering us like this and the other cool stuff that you do. Cheers!

[""The German army was highly mechanized""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DerScheisser/comments/b0g6dc/the_german_army_was_highly_mechanized/) (403 Upvotes, 16 Comments)

>	Many wehraboos claim that the bombing of Dresden in 1945 was a war crime (with some even putting it on par with the Holocaust), despite the fact that they do not have the same level of condemnation of the bombing raids conducted by the Nazis in the beginning of the war. As the head of British Bomber Command, Sir Arther Harris (of whom /r/DerScheisser has a bit of an infatuation with) put it, *""The have sown the wind, and now they shall reap the whirlwind""*

[Western Tank Design in a Nutshell](https://www.reddit.com/r/DerScheisser/comments/dwlyp3/western_tank_design_during_wwii_in_a_nutshell/) (295 Upvotes, 21 Comments)

>	There's a big crossover between /r/DerScheisser and /r/TankPorn, and this post reflects that by making fun of how different country handled tank design during the war. The Germans kept trying to put their powerful 88mm gun on their vehicles, while the British did the same with their 17 Pounder. Americans, on the other hand, belonged to the cult of the machine gun. I mean, in addition to a 37mm cannon as the main gun, the M2 tank could hold a whopping *nine* machine guns...about seven more than most other tanks at the time.

**80k** *cubers solving* for **10 years!**

There once was a time where everyone at school was spinning these colorful cubes until our fingers, eyes or brains hurt (whichever came first). We all gave up on solving these little square puzzles, so they sat in our drawers for years on end. But what's happened to them now..?

Welcome to r/Cubers, where all topics about Rubik's Cubes and other twisty puzzles are discussed, ranging from a 2×2 collection of corners to the ultimate 9×9 Megaminx and beyond! Some of these tasks take seconds to complete, while the latter takes hours. A large majority of the community are based around ""speedcubing"" (solving puzzles as fast as possible) but many are just interested in the puzzle aspect, or are collectors.

While the subreddit has strict rules about what sort of posts are allowed, there is always a daily thread where you can ask any questions you have (beginners are very welcome). Whether you're solving for the first time, or you're trying to push for a sub-10 and need some critiquing, a friendly cuber will be there to help.

Here are some of the most impressive posts from the sub:

**10.500** MBTI enthusiasts *memeing* for **exactly 1 Year!**

*****

r/mbtimemes is, as the name already gives away, a community for memes about **MBTI** and its **16 personality types**. The **Myers Briggs Type Indicator** ([MBTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)) is the *worlds most popular* personality test, used by over 80% of the Fortune 100 companies (according to Forbes), and aims at helping people understand themselves and others better.

&#x200B;

While some people still debate the accuracy of the test and validity of the theory behind it there's one fact that for sure can't be debated:

[***MBTI is memeable af***.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbtimemes/top/?t=all)

&#x200B;

> **I haven't heard of ""MBTI"" before, can you please explain what it is?**

Sure, that's what I'm here for. In short, it's a personality assessment (featuring 16 different personality types) based on the works of world famous psychologist Carl G. Jung, who, in his book called ""Psychological Types"", introduced the idea that each person has a distinct psychological type or set of preferences. Things like *introversion* and *extroversion* were discussed, and *how people make decisions*. 

&#x200B;

1. **The 16 personality types all have a 4 letter code**, for example **ESTJ** or, the opposite type, **INFP**, with the first letter always being either an **I** or an **E**, standing either for **Introverted** or **Extroverted**.

2. The second letter is either an **N** or an **S** for either **iNtuitive** or **Sensing** (this one is a bit complex to explain, I recommend reading about it on the [official Myers Briggs website](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/sensing-or-intuition.htm?bhcp=1).

3. The third letter is either a **T** or an **F**, describing the tendency to make decisions based on objective principles and impersonal facts (**T**hinking) or put more weight on personal concerns and the people involved (**F**eeling)?

4. And the last letter of the code of your personality type is either a **P** or an **J** for either **J**udging (preferring to getting things decided) or **P**erceiving (preferring to staying open to new information and options).


The author's personality type is **ENTP**, which stands for Extroverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiver.

If all of this grabbed your interest you can [read more about it here](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/07/24/what-is-the-mbti-an-intro-for-beginners/), but for now let's get back to today's subreddit of the day. Because today, the 15th of February, is a special day for this community, since today marks its 1 year anniversary. 

&#x200B;

In this comparably short amount of time over 2.500 memes have been posted, which, thanks to the strict rules of this subreddit (regarding content) are only high quality MBTI memes, many of which are OC, too. Which, as usual, are getting ""stolen"" and posted to Instagram. But that's okay, because the MBTI community is one big, inclusive, cross-platform community. If you also happen to frequent YouTube you might also enjoy the various [MBTI Meme compilations](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mbti+memes), many of which are getting 5 to 6 figure amounts of views. 

&#x200B;

To be honest, the community has created and posted so many great memes already that it's really hard picking the best ones, but here are 4 (because every personality type has 4 letters (my own is [ENTP](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ENTP) btw)) from the top of the Top of all times page:

&#x200B;

That's everything you have to know about r/mbtimemes. There are separated subreddits for memes of every personality type (eg r/ENTPmemes), so come and give us a visit, and if you have any questions or trouble understanding the memes there is an active community that'll help you dive into this new universe :)

**12.9k** members for **11 months!**

r/grassdoggos is a subreddit for posting cute ""grass doggos."" They have amassed over 12k subscribers since March 2019 which is quite impressive.

Grass doggos are generally considered to be a number of animals. The general rule is that grass doggos are herbivorous and reside on grass most of the time. However, what constitutes a grass doggo is always being rediscussed and reevaluated.

The sub originally was only for cows but has since expanded into a wide variety of other animals, including quokkas, porcupines, prairie dogs, sheep, alpacas, llamas, camels, buffalo, and a lot more! Also, every weekend is Free-Post Weekend where other animals can be posted as long as they aren't ""pet"" animals.

Here are some awesome submissions from the sub:

* [When a cow is REALLY happy to see you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrassDoggos/comments/c9ink8/when_a_cow_is_really_happy_to_see_you)
* [Happy horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrassDoggos/comments/ca7l42/happy_horse/)

r/OscarsDeathRace is an accidental community dedicated to watching every Oscar Nominated film before the Academy Awards Ceremony each year. Many have been doing it for years without realising it's a real thing and they aren't the only one! No one's defending the Oscars as the pinocle of film merit or a barometer of film quality but the nominees each year allow a fan-of-film to sample this year's cinema summary.

The sub is dedicated to counting down to the ceremony with daily discussions of the film's, their predictions, and progress. We have a small dedicated community for 3 months of the year and this year we've seen a surge in the number of tracking tools our community have been creating for individual and group tracking.

So if you like talking about movies and want to get exposed to some of the best of each year. Come join us on r/OscarsDeathRace. Obviously the year is almost out with the ceremony only a week away, but come check us out and maybe throw your hat in the ring for 2021!

Cool things we've been up to this year:

* [40 Days of Film Nominee Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarsdeathrace/comments/egomy1/the_oscars_death_race_2020_40_days_of_film/)

Want to brush up on Oscars trivia? Here's some fun facts for this year's awards:

* **Number: 1.** That’s how many times South Korea has been recognized in the Foreign Language/International Film category, thanks to Bong Joon Ho and *Parasite*.

* **Number: 29.** That’s the number of years that have passed since Joe Pesci’s last Oscar nomination (when he won Best Supporting Actor for 1990’s *GoodFellas*). And that’s not even a record! Sylvester Stallone and Helen Hayes each went 39 years between their nominations.

* **EGOT Watch!** If Cynthia Erivo wins for *Harriet*, she will become only the second black best actress winner - after Halle Berry in 2002. Not only that, but at 33 she will become the youngest person to become an EGOT - the winner of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards.

* **OK, Boomer.** In the best supporting actor category, the average age of the nominees is 71. Brad Pitt is the baby at 56, and will go up against Hanks (63), Joe Pesci (76), Al Pacino (79) and Sir Anthony (82).

* ***Honeyland* made Oscar history.** No movie until now has ever managed to score nominations for both Documentary Feature and International Feature.

* **Who's laughing now?** The most-nominated film this year is Todd Phillips’s *Joker*, which is only the second comic-book movie to receive a Best Picture nod (after *Black Panther* last year). ""For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice."" They are, indeed.

And the Oscar goes to... **r/Oscars**!

/r/Hardstyle is ~~a Phuture Noize fan-sub~~ where you go, if the rhythm of your life starts at 150 BPM. Everything from hardstyle and hard trance to hardcore are welcome here!

But what is hardstyle, you may ask? Wikipedia defines it as:

> [Hardstyle is a Dutch electronic dance genre mixing influences from techno and hardcore.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardstyle?wprov=sfla1)

But yeah, don't pay attention to that. They're just words. Hardstyle is happiness, euphoria, elation, joy. Usually brought about by [heavy kick-drums](https://youtu.be/OpT5A9Qdweo), [really dirty-screeches](https://youtu.be/l8YBDDpAhk8), and/or [beautiful melodies](https://youtu.be/PhUqWjCZbSU).

Interested? Well, you're in luck. Q-dance, one of the pioneers the hardstyle scene are celebrating their 20th birthday, like right now, and well, you only celebrate it once. 

So, how else do you celebrate it than throw a big-ass party, setup laser-shows and pyrotechnics, invite the biggest artists to perform, and oh, lest I forget, let the users nominate the top-100 hardstyle tracks of all time. Neat, right? 

We already know what tracks are at [position 26-100](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/f0ozde/hardstyle_top_100_of_all_time/), and [join us as we countdown the top 25 at 10.00 P.M.

What else is there to life?

While many people are familiar with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, and to a lesser extent with a handful of her controversial tweets (or in some cases, things that they think were her tweets), most people do not know that Rowling wrote a prolifera of longer form short writings both in-universe and out-of-universe, that actually extend the Harry Potter world and look into its characters. She's also drawn illustrations of many of the characters and scenes from the series.

For nearly the past two years, /r/RowlingWritings has been regularly posting one of these every Sunday, along with some detailed notes about where each item was published. These items come from several official websites (most now defunct), video games, charity auctions, tv documentaries, and museum exhibits. Some index posts help to cross-reference everything shared, and most posts have some healthy discussion underneath.

Here are some examples of posts you’ll find on the subreddit:

1. [Professor McGonagall's backstory](https://www.reddit.com/r/RowlingWritings/comments/8j3m0x/professor_mcgonagall/)
2. [Illustration of Harry and Hagrid at Gringotts](https://www.reddit.com/r/RowlingWritings/comments/9s2ypy/hagrid_and_harry_at_gringotts/)
3. [Rowling's handwritten original list of the forty students in Harry's year](https://reddit.com/r/RowlingWritings/comments/9u3it8/the_original_forty/)

Recently, there was also [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RowlingWritings/comments/emt5wu/best_rowling_writings_of_2019_results/) where users shared what their favorite posts were and why!

Everyone loves the Oscars. Year in and year out, it's one of the most-viewed telecasts of the year, and almost always at or near the very top if you take out football. Part of it is because we love seeing various celebrities paired up to wear nice dresses and deliver the world's softest jokes, but on the whole, we just love seeing great movies get recognized. What if we could capture that fervor of Oscar season and try to stretch it out all year? That's where we come in.

Welcome to /r/oscarrace! Your year-round home for discussion of the Oscars, Golden Globes, and any other tangentially-related film awards thing. We take a look at every precursor award, dig up historical trivia, post trailers, follow festivals, take wild guesses a year out that end up being not too far off all things considered, do some ill-advised psychological profiling, and so much more, until the actual awards happen and we start all over again.

If you love movies and you love seeing (usually) good movies win things, then come on to /r/oscarrace! We're always open!

This community is for people posting memes related to the famous 1980s British sitcom, Blackadder, starring Rowan Atkinson (known also for his role as Mr. Bean). The show broadcasted from 1983 to 1987, and was famous for its incredible writing, incredible acting and unique use of history as the backdrop of a sitcom. It is still well known throughout the world, but especially in the United Kingdom where it was made famous, especially its fourth and final season.

The memes on this sub can either revolve around the show or simply use parts of the show as backdrops for other subjects. 

Much of the community posts memes relating to history, as the community was involved in the recent r/HistoryMemes Civil War event that occurred this December, which it won along with some other small subreddits. However, the memes posted on the sub can revolve around anything, so long as they are related to Blackadder.

With that in mind, I hope you will not object if I also offer those visiting the subreddit my most enthusiastic contrafibularities.

Every horseperson knows the adage, ""A man's horse is the mirror of his soul"". But the hard truth is that not everyone likes what he sees.

Horses are incapable of flattery or guile.  If your horse does not like you, it is because you are not a likeable person.  If your horse will not follow you, it is because you are not a leader.  Such uncompromising, brutal honesty is almost unheard of in human relationships.

As a result, horsepeople tend to have intense rapports with their horses.

This subreddit is a place where horsepeople come together to share our common passion for an animal that has fundamentally reshaped the course of human history, and that can help us better understand ourselves as human beings.

Ghost Stories is a place to share your past or present spooky, weird, unexplainable, paranormal stories that you've bottled up. This might be because you have nobody to share them with, don't know anyone that would believe you, or maybe you think that you'd end up in an asylum.

Whatever the case that you might need this subreddit, R/GhostStories has over 50,000 people to listen to your story. Some may try to prove the validity of your tale, some will tell you how spooky your story is and want to know more, but many will try and help you understand it better if they can.

Some of the recent favourites of the community and our moderators are these following posts:

• [My Imaginary Friend, Charlie](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/ei5suy/my_imaginary_friend_charlie/)

• [Wait a moment, Ghost. Please and thank you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/emci0y/wait_a_moment_ghost_please_and_thank_you/)

Our main rule for posting is that what you post is true. You, as a poster, must believe/know your story is real.

Feet. We all have them. A lot of us may even be fans of feet, after all they are what gets us from A to B. But only a select few of us love them. Like *really love them*.
  
/r/VerifiedFeet is a safe place for the enlightened among us, those who are followers of the feetsies. Granted, there are a lot more foot fetishists than one might expect - in fact, 33% of fetishes have to do with a specific body part. I myself prefer earlobes, but I can't find a subreddit for those. Anyway, back on track. /r/VerifiedFeet is a platform for verified Reddit foot models to post their high quality original content. Emphasis on verified, because this subreddit is *strictly* for verified posters, so you can be sure that all content is coming from Reddit foot models.  
  
While you wouldn't really want your employer seeing you scrolling through this subreddit at work, not every post is technically NSFW. Some, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifiedFeet/comments/etu401/pink_soles/) or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifiedFeet/comments/etrfkx/happy_saturday_babes/) are feet and only feet.

There are also some [great gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifiedFeet/comments/dsdk7g/had_to_speed_this_up_in_order_to_get_a_good_gif/) and [virtous (sorry can't think of a v adjective) vids](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifiedFeet/comments/etttpl/i_dont_want_to_get_dressed_i_feel_so_comfy/)!

We're looking for new moderators!,402,eoo61z,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/eoo61z/were_looking_for_new_moderators/,47,"##**TL;DR: [APPLY HERE!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPBzPUDGCQA4XYwOqRbVgTM-Qk2nKu8AQa-5WANh-Eo_3myg/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

Hello everyone!

Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay, we constantly strive to feature the best subs that we can. And for this it's important to have a fairly large team, as to avoid personal preferences of a writer taking preference over the quality of the sub itself. It's one thing to be able to distinguish a feature-worthy sub from a not feature worthy one, but it's another thing entirely to be able to express why that sub should be featured, and to make it entertaining. After all, entertainment and good subs are the reason people come here ~~(and probably drama too but we sorta don't want to have so much of that so uuuhhhh moving on)~~.

Achieving a high standard of awesome every day can be difficult though. Sometimes we end up being short-handed for a while, and in that time the sub quality can suffer immensely. I'll let you in on a little secret, if you ever see a feature that's just a single link, it's probably because we had absolutely no features and no time to write one, so we just picked a sub that one of us moderated, or that was nominated in modmail by a mod of that sub, and went with it. This isn't something that we enjoy having to do, much less do on a regular basis. This is a problem that we can't fix alone though, and that is why we're recruiting some awesome talented reddit users (AKA: You!) to help out the SROTD cause! Yep, it's that time of year, it's Intern Time!

Here's what you're signing up for when you become an intern:

* You get to feature subs that you enjoy and believe should be featured (unless the sub is objectively terrible, of course).

* You would be added as a moderator to /r/SubredditOfTheDay, a subreddit with over 700,000 subscribers! 

* You would be given the super fun and fulfilling job of ~~responding to modmails of people calling you racial slurs after you told them to stop telling users to die~~ dealing with user nominations and inquiries via modmail!

* You get access to the secret powermod cabal subreddit, where we remove literally every dissenting opinion from Reddit and ban 500 accounts at random every day. Or something like that. My mom says she'll order us pizza though so that'll be cool.

#Requirements for becoming an intern

* Be somewhat active on Reddit, at least a few times a week

* Boo /u/_tomGER

* Be decent at writing. Preferably be good though.

* That's it. No prior mod experience needed!

# What would I have to do once I'm added?
Once you're added as an intern, there are a few steps before you can be added as a full mod. This is a brief overview, but the whole thing is quite easy:

* Write 4 features in 40 days, along with a single user nomination (guest written feature) and 2 /r/TinySubredditoftheDay features (which are literally a sentence each, don't worry.)

* The deadline for all of this is 40 days after being added, but it can realistically be done in less than a week, so don't worry about not having enough time to do it, you'll have plenty.

#What would being a full mod of SRotD entail?

* You'd be expected to remain at least somewhat active after being added as a full moderator. One feature a month at least is sorta what we're aiming for though it's flexible.


So in short, if you're interested in writing and/or moderating, and want to see your favourite subs grow, come join us on /r/SubredditOfTheDay!

r/catvoice is a sub dedicated to the vocalisations and body language of cats. Any member of the [felidae family tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae) is welcome! There are only 2 rules: no abusive videos, and no videos which have had irrelevant music added to them in post. If the video is mainly about the cat's body language, the second rule can be ignored (and indeed silent GIFs can be posted in such cases).

The sub has been around for 2 years, and currently has 1,655 subscribers. Up until the last ~6 months or so, it has just been me posting videos for my own amusement, but things have been picking up a little lately, with new regular posters contributing fairly regularly, and with some even posting the occasional OC of their own cats (which is the most gratifying thing for me to see as the sub's creator).

My personal favourite examples of what the sub is about include [The Two Talking Cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/comments/a49me0/classic_repost_the_two_talking_cats/), [Siamese Kitten LOUDEST Purring](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/comments/a49mnk/classic_repost_siamese_kitten_loudest_purring/) and [Friendly Cheetah](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/comments/aybkl5/friendly_cheetah/). Each post is flaired according to the predominant style of communication the cat in question is using. For instance, you can search for all of the posts featuring the [chirp/chattering](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AChirp%2FChatter) phenomenon, or maybe you're in the mood for some anxiety-melting [purring](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APurr), or perhaps you feel like a laugh and want to see some Kitty Kombat in the form of [hissing/growling/spitting](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AHiss%2FGrowl%2FSpit). If you're wondering what body language a cat could possibly exhibit, there are no better examples than the classic [Good morning, give me breakfast](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/comments/6yrdiy/good_morning_give_me_breakfast/) and [Cat Uses Sign Language to Ask for Food](https://www.reddit.com/r/catvoice/comments/6yrctl/cat_uses_sign_language_to_ask_for_food/) videos.

r/JustNotRight is a writing subreddit where you can post fictional stories of almost all genres that are well, just not right. 

We have flairs from you to choose from: White is discussion type, while Grey is for the different genre's you could choose from and red is for trigger warnings. Red flairs take priority when choosing your genre. Here are some mod favorites: 

* [Mama killed my brother](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/e7zlw2/mamas_killed_my_brother_twice_and_hes_still_here/)

* [An interesting show](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/dsgaul/daddys_gotta_mow/) 

We also have a ^(so far) [community favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/duulcu/an_act_of_passion/) and is a real trigger warning.

JNR doesn't have strict rules because we want our writers to share their amazing stories and we want our readers to read the incredibly craftsmanship the writers put into their stories. 

So go ahead, check us out and subscribe for some good content!

**376** Singers *recording duets* for **4 Years** 

Alright, I'll be honest. It's been a while since we've had a chance to chat. And this sub, sure, it seems a little out of place when we have subreddits that are featured that have thousands upon thousands of subscribers. But, give me a minute here, and I'll give you a good reason to get involved. Tell me, are any of you readers out there singers? Don't answer that, because you can't... unless it's after we get this posted.

Okay, besides that... I'm sure a few of you out there are amateur shower singers. Ever think you were good enough to post it on the internet? No? Cool! There's anonymity too. But, for those of you who DO have the pipes and the will to post it online, there's /r/SingKaraoke. You can post your recordings from the [Smule app](http://www.smule.com) that you find online. Okay. I know what you're thinking. ""Dude, the subreddit hasn't been active for over a year."" And [yes, you're right](https://www.smule.com/p/766862846_2002256262), however, the subreddit was just [turned over to a new mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/singkaraoke/comments/ebyq7x/mod_welcome/) and so there's a huge opportunity! It's time to revitalize the karaoke scene, and together, I think we can do it.

Not only will we [revitalize the karaoke scene](https://www.smule.com/recording/louis-armstrong-what-a-wonderful-world/1387775934_3317057271), like I try to do now, but bring life to a sub that never had the chance to live. And, I hope that you'll take the time to join me.

**2,000** centrists in disguise for **1** month!

Ah, politics. The pinnacle of mankind's existence. Ever since the debut of differences in thought, people have been ~~settling it in Smash~~ arguing. In fact, people have gotten quite good at arguing over something that doesn't even make a huge impact in the end. 

Arguing over politics online is usually a fruitless effort because of a rule that I forgot the name of but can assure you is true because I saw it on the Internet somewhere once. The rule says that any attempt at political discussion, given enough time, will turn into a one-sided echo chamber, something that can plainly be see all over Reddit.

Enter /r/Polcompball. Those of you familiar with /r/PoliticalCompassMemes and /r/polandball will quickly notice the etymology of the subreddit's name. For those of you who aren't familiar, [here's a detailed explaination I made in about 30 seconds.](https://i.imgflip.com/3kt9lu.jpg) 

In /r/Polcompball, one can expect witty, homegrown comics that are reminiscent of older, better times of Internet political discussion. This subreddit is one of the only political places on Reddit that isn't really one-sided, inheriting this value from /r/PoliticalCompassMemes. Whether this development can be attributed to the humorous and meme-y origins of the subreddit, or the fact that it's only a month old, only time will tell. 

Witnessing the birth of a subreddit is always an amazing experience, especially when it attempts to fill such an unprecedented role. By chronicling the state of this subreddit, I hope to be of help to future internet historians who may hope to discover the same things we are all looking for.

If you'd like to get started, some good resources to look at include the [8x8 alignment chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polcompball/comments/e7gbtv/political_compass_ball_chart/), the mod-maintained [polcompball canon](https://imgur.com/a/04ZvBqX), or [the flair guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polcompball/comments/e7f1b2/this_post_is_sponsored_by_the_party/).

After doing my research, I was still curious about the subreddit, so I asked the mods some questions. The following is an interview with the mods of /r/Polcompball:

1. What ideology do you identify as?

    > **StormTiger2304**: Social Libertarian (the market should be free except for human rights related stuff, culturally variable)

    > **Monkeysszz**: I'm a libertarian that supports global capitalism, but with an emphasis on worker-owned companies at a local level. 

    > **mangoesaresuperior**: Capcom gang (I like both Libertarianism and Maoism)

    > **IncendiaryBullet**: Libertarian, maybe a Social Libertarian.

2. What ideology do you think is the most interesting?

    > **StormTiger2304**: Distributism (society should be marked by widespread property ownership; in opposition to socialism and capitalism, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, it's not an ideology that you can easily place on a spectrum)

    > **Monkeysszz**: Egoism, definitely. 

    > **mangoesaresuperior**: Posadism, obviously

    > **IncendiaryBullet**: Ancap. It’s just a meme turned into an ideology.

3. When did you join this subreddit and why?

    > **StormTiger2304**: A week or so after it was created. As a fan of both polandball and political memes, it seemed like a match made in heaven.

    > **Monkeysszz**: I joined a month or so ago. I independently started drawing polandball-style comics using political ideologies to /r/politicalcompassmemes and my submissions were frequently crossposted to this sub, so I ended just posting them here instead, where they were the main focus anyway. 

    > **mangoesaresuperior**: I like ball comics and politics, but don't care about Europe enough to enjoy polandball

    > **IncendiaryBullet**: N/A. As to why I created it, mainly to get more content for a subject not popular on the normal PCM.

4. Being that this subreddit is pretty new, it’s very impressive that y’all have built it up in the way that you have. What factors do you think contributed to this success?

    > **StormTiger2304**: I'd be lying if I said we aren't piggybacking a bit from the r/PoliticalCompassMemes fanbase, but I think that the extra profile customization and less strict drawing guidelines than r/polandball have a lot to do with the popularity spike.

    > **Monkeysszz**: Taking political ideologies and representing them with ball characters is an idea that many people like for different reasons. For some it's a way to promote a dialogue, for some it's another way to format a political comic, and for others it's simply for fun. I think an intersection of different things has lead people to make content for this sub.

    > **mangoesaresuperior**: The connection with PCM, mainly, but also the fact that polcompball comics really should have had a sub sooner

    > **IncendiaryBullet**: The existence of PoliticalCompassMemes. Many cross posts between the subs gained the attention of people who were already interested in this kind of humor.

5. PCM is notorious for being able to host political discussion in a civilized manner, and I have observed the same here. What do you think makes this possible?

    > **StormTiger2304**: Political Compass Memes require to make fun of your own ideologies, which greatly eases the discussions. Strawmen, even if believed by others unironically, are taken by the target as a joke. Offense may be given, but the memey context surrounding the sub assures that none is taken. A similar situation happens here, which is smoothed even further by the ""cutesy"" art borrowed from polandball. Seeing ideologies having facial expressions helps with empathy, is my guess.

    > **Monkeysszz**: The majority of people are coming here to laugh, rather than to be preached to, so like PCM, the majority of the content here prioritizes humor. If a submitter wants to promote to certain message, they are incentivized to present that message humorously and non-confrontationally, which allows people to debate in a more healthy manner.

    > **mangoesaresuperior**: I think it takes a certain amount of maturity to be able to poke fun of yourself in the way that posts on these subs do. So naturally, most posters are mature enough for civilised discussion.

    > **IncendiaryBullet**: I’d say it’s the satirical nature of both subs. It’s based around mockery of all ideologies, not being particularly biased to one side or the other, thus creating a relaxed and amicable atmosphere that dissuades hostility.

6. Do you have anything else to add?

    > **StormTiger2304**: Every month we have comic tournaments, with special username flairs as prizes. Good jokes get more points than great art, so why not give it a try?

    > **Monkeysszz**: Not that I can think of.

    > **mangoesaresuperior**: Capcom gang > nazbol gang

    > **IncendiaryBullet**: I really like the diversity of opinions in the sub, even if they disagree with my own. It’s nice to be in a political sub that isn’t an echo chamber.

**692,213** *Explorers* for **9 years**!

&nbsp;

Happy New Year to you all, and thanks for coming to see the annual /r/SRotD recap! Or maybe you just saw the bot's Congrats post. It's always good fun when the bot does that. 2019 has not been the easiest year for SRotD, to be sure. We had our ups and our downs and the downs were often difficult. On many occasions we were barely able to scrape a feature together to post, and on some occasions we had to post them manually, hours after the normal scheduled date. To try and bring the awesome every day, we'll need some help from you. So in a few days time, we will be posting an application to become a writer here on /r/SubredditOfTheDay, so do look out for that!

##500,000 subscribers!

Just at the beginning of the year, we hit 500,000 subscribers, and what a milsetone it was. We never expected so many people to be tuning in to our little corner of the deep dark internet to find cool subs. And we're thankful for every one of those of you that have tuned in, whether it be daily, once or twice a week, or even just 2 or 3 a year. We hope that you all were at least entertained by our literary ramblings and shitposts over the days and years.

##600,000 subscribers!

No wait i'm not even over 500,000 subscribers yet give me a moment... Wait, we're nearly at ***700,000*** subscribers now? *What?*

##2019 in review

Despite the struggles we've faced on the sub this year, we've still managed to get a sub featured every damn day. And that's something that we're proud of, at least. Most of the subs were good. Some of the features were shit. Let's look at both.

##The top features of 2019

**1:** [*/r/FragileWhiteRedditor: Racism is only true racism when it's against whites.*](https://redd.it/cam9bn) - Oh my, we're not even close to the controversial posts yet. This one was the top of the sub by a considerable margin. Written by our very one /u/verifypassword__

**2:** [*/r/detrashed: Cleaning up the environment one piece of trash at a time.*](https://redd.it/cebvrv) - Second highest for a damn good reason. I'm so glad that environmentalism has taken off this year, and this sub deserved the feature so much. Written once again by mister /u/VerifyPassword__, this time with capital letters.

**3:** [*/r/WhereAreTheChildren: Dedicated to keeping track and organization against the detention facilities at the US southern border*](https://redd.it/c9f5cy) - Did someone say more politics? Though if you consider inhumane treatment of children because of where their parents dragged them off to a partisan issue, perhaps you're not ready for the real world just yet. Written by guest writer /u/ethansucc.

**4:** [*/r/vegan: How do you know if a vegan subreddit exists? Don't worry, we'll tell you!*](https://redd.it/adtylw) - Outside of the cringy vegan circlejerk on the internet exists a lovely community who just want to encourage the vegan lifestyle. Written once again by /u/Verifypassword__, dude must have been on a role this year.

**5:** [*/r/All: The front page of the front page of Reddit!*](https://redd.it/b81df6) - Literally the best sub out there, enough said. Written by /u/ConalfIsher, he sounds very handsome, I must say. Also, I just realised I fucked up the title, it was meant to be ""the front page of the front page of the internet"". It's a sad day.

&nbsp;

So those are the good ones,

##Let's look at the controversial ones

**1:** [*/r/PolicePorn: High quality SFW pictures of police.*](https://redd.it/afvkx9) - Yeah, in hindsight anything to do with police won't go down well. Written by /u/verifypassword__. 

**2:** [*/r/FragileWhiteRedditor*](https://redd.it/cam9bn) - Hitting the top of the list both times, impressive. Also written by /u/verifypassword__.

**3:** [*/r/SandersForPresident: Bernie Sanders for President 2020*](https://redd.it/apg0wn) - You know, maybe it's a good thing SROTD Town Hall didn't happen last year. Now we can save all the popcorn for this year. It's a long-term investment, really. Written by guest writer /u/IrrationalTsunami.

**4:** [*/r/SequelMemes: Memes of the Star Wars Sequels*](https://redd.it/aqji6c) - If only we'd saved this one for after TROS, it would have topped the list. Written by /u/OwnTheKnight

**5:** [*/r/EntitledKarens: A place to talk about Karens, her kids, her beliefs and her attitude.*](https://redd.it/cdgkoe) - It seems that this one was brigaded from somewhere, usually people don't mind the Karen meme as much, or didn't when it was still breathing.  Written by guest writer /u/FGex123.


*****

And that about sums up this year. It's been a fun one. A difficult one, sure, but a fun one nonetheless. Now as is tradition here in these annual recaps, it's time for a round of

**14,652** explorers *loving the small subs* for **5 years**!

&nbsp;

This year wasn't a particularly eventful year for /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay. However, subscribers were gained, subs were featured, people (hopefully) gave some tiny subs some love, and really, what more can you ask from it? Nevertheless, I will now go through the top 10 highest upvoted featured subs of the year and see how they're all doing now. While there's unfortunately no way of seeing the sub count when the sub was featured (which we really should get going in the new decade), we can assume that they were at least all under 1,000 subscribers when featured, and as such we can roughly guess how well they've done since the feature. We surely cannot take all the credit but hopefully we here at TSrotD were able to give them all a well-deserved boost.

###1. /r/Lovedeathandrobots

This little sub has grown into quite a large sub, sporting nearly 29,000 subscribers. As the sub was featured only a few weeks after a new season of the show was revealed, I'm sure that had a lot to do with the explosion in popularity.

###2. /r/SimDemocracy

A nifty little sub based around democractically electing mods, rules, etc. The sub has grown substantially and the democratic government even more so. Though a very large chunk of this growth can be attributed to a single event, which is too large and fucked to describe in this small paragraph, but if you absolutely love sub drama, and by golly was this some buttery drama, you can [read all about it here](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/dawhic/the_drama_continues_in_rsimdemocracy_as_it_is/). Also, /r/DemocracyExperiment is pretty cool too. No bias here, don't worry. 

###3. /r/Isopods

A sub about neat little bugs, namely the pillbug and its relatives. Has grown to a sizeable 2,861 subscribers. No tricks are dramatic happenings that I can find, simply good moderation and a steady increase in subscribers as the quality and topic bring people in.

###4. /r/BookCoverPorn

A sub for really lovely book covers. Still going and as active as ever, having amassed 1.4K subscribers and a steady flow of posts


###5. /r/TheTrials

An online subreddit game, boasting a modest 306 subscribers still. Still active, moreso in the discord than the subreddit at the moment but it's still pushing on. And I speak from experience when I say that for any roleplay-esque sub like this one qhere there's more than just entertaining posts, keeping it active is a difficult task that requires a ton of constant oversight and effort. So I applaud the mods of /r/thetrials for their efforts.

### 6. /r/SSSSGRIDMAN

Based on an anime of the same name, the sub has grown to a sizeable 4,000 subscribers, surely as the anime itself has grown in popularity. The sub is still filled with various related media, artwork, theories and more. A positively thriving community even still.

###7. /r/1000daysofpractice

With over 3,000 subscribers (that's 3 for every day of practice!), the sub is still stronger than ever, and with New Years around the corner (or already here, depending on when you're reading this) and new years resolutions about to drop, I'm sure it'll get even larger for next year!

###8. /r/alitabattleangel

Boasting over 7,000 subscribers now, this is certainly the sub that's grown the most since being featured here. This is certainly due at least in part to the release of a movie based on the anime. Though we'll just pretend that it was TSrotD doing all the work.

###9. /r/AfterEffects

This thing had over 100k subscribers when it was featured, so... Yeah, I have no clue how this one happened. We'll just skip it I guess. Good sub though, but not, you know, tiny.

###9 (but for realsies). /r/forgottoswitchaccount

A mixture of /r/quityourbullshit and /r/cringepics, posts in this sub are always a blast. It's grown by over 500 subscribers since being featured, and I hoope to see it grow more, since it certainly has a ton of potential.

###10. /r/myleftfoot

Gotta save the best till last. No words. Only feet. And that's enough.

*****

And as a small final note to end off this year's recap, months and months ago TSrotD did a mod application, and mods will be picked from that in the new year, so if you applied for that, good luck!

/r/BarBattlestations is a pretty straight-forward subreddit that you can use to share pictures of your liquor cabinet, booze bench, home bar and any tips or tricks for other users, this subreddit isn't just for pictures, you make discussions about what key features your bar should include.


This subreddit is like the /r/Battlestations subreddit but instead for you home bar set up, you know what I'm trying to say?

/r/Amoledbackgrounds is a subreddit for backgrounds for OLED phones, mainly black for screen power saving and contrast.

If you have a amoled display then you can save some battery by using black, or generally darker wallpapers for your mobile phone.
When compared to a LCD an Amoled display is going to be head an shoulders better than your LCD equivalent.


AMOLED displays provide higher refresh rates than passive-matrix,often reducing the response time to less than a millisecond, and they consume significantly less power.This advantage makes active-matrix OLEDs well-suited for portable electronics, where power consumption is critical to battery life.


______


Over the past two years the subreddit has grown massively to having over 110k subscribers. The subreddit also has a [AMOLED Image Request Thread VI] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amoledbackgrounds/comments/d2r6sw/amoled_image_request_thread_vi), and a [Monthly Homescreen/Lockscreen thread | December 2019]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/Amoledbackgrounds/comments/e4axkg/monthly_homescreenlockscreen_thread_december_2019) these threads get a lot of comments in them, this goes to show how popular the community is. 


The subreddit also has ""Recognized Amoledditor"". This is a flair on the subreddit that awards people that spend their time making backgrounds for other users on the subreddit.

**51,878** *traders* for **8 years**!

&nbsp;

We've all been there. You've just been given a gift card. You said thanks, appreciated the gesture, then realised that you had absolutely no chance of ever actually spending it. Whether it be for some obscure clothes store or just something you have absolutely no interest in you know that that gift card is condemned to sitting in the bedside drawer for all of time, or at least until you can regift it to someone. The other day I found a £10 gift card for Debenhams (a UK clothing store) in my own bedside table that I'm pretty sure has been sitting there for at least 5 years. I don't think I've ever been to that store, and if I ever do I sure as hell aren't going to remember to bring that with me.


And I'm sure that many of you reading this are in that situation right now. Someone has given you a lovely Christmas present of a gift card that you'll never spend. It would have been so much easier if they'd just given you the monetary equivalent of that card in cash, since £20 is objectively better than a £20 gift card on every way, but alas, social etiquette ruins that idea. Now it's up to you to convert that useless gift card into something that isn't useless. And on top of that, you're probably too lazy to leave the house and would much rather find a Reddit-centric solution (I sure know I would.) Lucky for you, there's a solution, and that solution is /r/GiftCardExchange!

/r/GiftCardexchange is exactly what it sounds like, it's a marketplace of sorts for exchanging gift cards for other gift cards that you'd find more useful. Now, Reddit obviously isn't designed with this in mind, it's a forum, not meant for trading, meaning that steps have to be taken to ensure that transactions go smoothly and scammers are absolutely minimised. And in this regard I have to commend the mods for doing an outstanding job at keeping this place running. Due to their dedication it is extremely difficult to be scammed outright without a ton of stupidity on your own part (and by that I mean literally not checking the [big massive list of scammers](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php) at all, or trading with a brand new account, or something as dumb). There's a complex system involved to prevent people from scammers, so if you're reading all of this thinking if it's worth it to attempt a trade or now, don't worry, you'll be fine as long as you actually follow the rules you're explicitly told (and for god's sake look at the sidebar before doing anything holy shit.) Now I'm not going to attempt to explain the whole process of trading in this post, because for one it'd be way too long, but also I'd risk messing up somewhere and potentially misinforming people on how to do it correctly, so... Yeah, just read the sidebar.

This isn't necessarily an entertaining sub, so there aren't too many jokes to be made in this feature, but /r/GiftCardexchange is a sub that deserves to be highlighted, for its ingenuity and usefulness if nothing else. It's rather unique in the redditverse, and it shows what a group of intelligent users and dedicated mods can do to turn a subreddit into something more. If you're looking to get rid of any gift cards you've been lugging around since Christmas of even before, this is the place to go.

/r/lostsubways is my art project to map the lost streetcar and subway systems of North America.  A few years ago, I lived in Los Angeles and was stuck in traffic on the 101 freeway - I got frustrated because LA didn't have good mass transit.  So I went to the library, and stumbled on a map of LA's 1000-mile light rail system from the 1920s.  (These are the Red Cars of *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* fame.)

This shocked me. I figured that freeways were the natural state of LA, like beaches, tacos, and palm trees.  But that wasn't the case at all.  Instead of fixing their transit system, the people of Los Angeles chose to junk the Red Cars, and build a bunch of freeways instead.  This story repeated itself all over the continent.

One thing led to another, and I started on an art project to draw these past systems, their modern counterparts, and rapid transit projects that never got off the drawing board.

When someone is under the influence of mind-altering substances, the result isn’t always pretty. r/tooktoomuch is an archive of the numerous videos showing heavily intoxicated individuals, with the ultimate goal of identifying and discussing the relevant substance. Hopefully, this will inspire productive conversation about the best ways to navigate situations where drugs are involved, but at the very least, one can always come for a good laugh at ridiculous drug-fueled antics.

Before joining, keep in mind that r/tooktoomuch does not aim to encourage illegal drug use. Rather, it serves as an open space to share examples of what **not** to do, lest you end up featured on the subreddit yourself. Taking substances can sometimes be funny, but it can also be life-threatening—the first step toward avoiding these dangerous situations is to be informed of the consequences.

Don’t take too much. Be safe.

And with that, here are a few top posts that you’ll find on r/tooktoomuch.

Boku No Hero Academia, or My Hero Academia, as people also like to call it, is a story written in a society where people manifested special powers called ""quirks"". We follow the story of a class of teenagers in a academy for heroes and their struggles fighting against powerful groups of villains.

With a 4th season of the anime and a massive collection of manga chapters, it's a huge story to get invested to and as such a lot of people already have.

If you like the manga or anime, be sure to check the subreddit out!

One of the biggest surprises of this anime season was the anime/manga Beaststars. Following the interesting dynamic in a world populated with animals of a wolf in love with a small white rabbit. It shows all the problem that society could experience in a quite dark and mature tone. So far I've really enjoyed following the anime and so did most people in the subreddit. Made by one of my most favourite studios, it's no wonder that something that was animated in 3D looks this amazing.

If you're a fan of the manga, enjoy the anime or ever thought to yourself ""How would Zootopia actually play out if it wasn't a kids film"", be sure to give it a visit!

We all love cool fantasy stuff. It helps us forget about the soul crushing existence the world aimlessly meanders through on a day to day basis. We spend out days doing boring repetitive shit for our capitalist overlords, but we can escape for a while through the power of fiction. None of that stuff happens to our protagonists, they just go on adventures and save people and/or the world. It's fun to imagine, which is probably why most humans are so good at it ~~I mean that's totally not the reason but ummmmmm shut up~~. But for those of us who aren't, you needn't worry, for there are people out there who do it all for you! There are an uncountable number of ways to present an imaginative idea. It could be a book, a film, music (of which there are an uncountable ways if presenting it as well; if only there were some type of week of features based around different musical genres coming in early January ***cough***); but the one we'll be focusing on today is art.


While art is an absolute beast of an art form, so massive that it's even the basis of the term, second maybe only to music (hence why there's no art week but there may or may not be a music week in early January ***cough***). But /r/ImaginaryWorlds focuses on drawings of cool world's that people have thought up. Those can be any style of world; a [cool magic world](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWorlds/comments/dq2umw/fountain_mountain_by_kou_takano/), [the exact opposite, with a hyper futuristic world](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWorlds/comments/dk1q97/kasai_by_joseph_biwald/), or maybe just simply [a really cool looking landscape](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWorlds/comments/8raphc/eclipse/). There are too many things to specify, and I'm sure that 2am me writing this on mobile has not done the best job at listing examples off (words are hard, moreso when describing amazing artworks in about 5 of them), but I hope you get the idea at least. It's a criminally unknown sub filled with all sorts of creative works and arts that anyone interested in art should check out!

When we think of snakes, we often think of the big massive ones that could eat you whole, or the super venomous ones whos bite can kill you in minutes. And while those snakes are really cool and are also worthy of note, there are many more types of snake that can make for surprisingly great pets. Now as a dog lover myself you best believe that I ain't ever getting me a big ass snek that could eat my family, friends, and most importantly probably my dog (or probably not because most pet snakes are pretty chill and just lie around eat mice occasionally). But many people who are more brave than me love these reptilian sentient scarves. Now I'm fully able to love them from a distance but I'm not the  type of person who'd buy 5 of them (mainly due to the aforementioned ""chomp on my pup"" thing); but if you are, then /r/Snek is the perfect sub for you!

/r/Snek is a sub for sneks. Why is it snek and not snake? Umm... Reasons. It stems from the same humorous wordplay as doggo or pupper, which I'm fully aware some people despise, but... Come on, Snek should get the pass. The sub is for pictures of snakes. [Big snakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Snek/comments/dx7z8j/absolute_unit/), [small snakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Snek/comments/djag1t/the_cutest_little_nope_rope/), [pet snakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Snek/comments/dl4m5i/bitey_little_dickhead/), [snakes that would 98% try to rip your face off](https://www.reddit.com/r/Snek/comments/dvlg30/big_heckin_scare/), and more! ~~No trouser snakes plz and thank you~~

You also have [snake memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Snek/comments/djjkrh/chubby_snek/) and other cool snake stuff that isn't just pictures. Overall, if you enjoy these cool creatures and feel your life and sanity are being slowly destroyed due to a severe lack of snakes in your life, this is the sub to go to!

&nbsp;

The Bossfight is an essential part of all video games. It is one of the most fundamental elements of a video game there is. Whether it be in the form of a hard level, a hard enemy, or a gauntlet filled with both, it exists, in some form, in pretty much every video game in existence. ~~This is the part where you all start bringing up exceptions to this generalization of mine~~

However, today we won't be discussing the bossfights themselves; we'll be focusing on the locations in which they take place. In a traditional video game format (eg, in an RPG), the setting of the bossfight is nearly as important as the bossfight itself. The boss can be really cool but in the wrong area, the atmosphere of the fight simply won't be as effective. So with this in mind, we can discuss r/BossfightArena. 

If you're not familiar with r/Bossfight, it's essentially a humorous subreddit taking weird and/or cool images of things and giving them a big fancy name that yous expect from a boss in a game. [Here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bossfight/comments/7ktsy4/akordeon_cursed_bard_of_the_underground/) of that. /r/BossfightArena is in a similar vein, but focusing on places in which bosses are faught as opposed to the bosses themselves. This mainly focuses on real life places which fit the video game boss fight aesthetic so well that it looks like it was ripped out of one. So this can be [extremely cool real life photos](https://redd.it/8wxc1g), [really cool photos of things](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bossfightarena/comments/dr2li2/the_peaks_of_omnipresence/) (which technically counts the last image as well but shhh), [cool edits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bossfightarena/comments/cvb7l5/the_prismatic_fields_lore_and_description_in/), you get the idea. It's a merge of r/Bossfight and r/earthporn in a lot of aspects, which results in a really cool and underrated subreddit, that I'd recommend you all check out!

In an age filled with badly mixed audios for home releases, where the background music that you don't give a shit about is ten times as loud as the dialogue, they're the one small relief our ears are given, allowing us to have the volume at a reasonable level while still knowing what the hell is going on. And if you're a weeb who wants to watch their favourite Japanese ***cartoons***, and you're also not a fucking monster who likes the dubbed versions, subs are perfect for you!

But making subtitles must be a boring job. I mean, it's just sitting down and listening to what they're saying and doing. In recent times voice recognition has arisen and made everything much easier, but that's still a lot of manual work to be done. So some subtitlers (that's the name I'm giving them if you disagree feel free to fight me in the comments) like to have a little bit of fun now and again. Perhaps adding a little bit extra to enhance the scene, or describing it in vivid detail; or maybe they just less up and don't realise the double meaning in their subs, whatever the case, there are often a lot of humorous moments in subtitles, and that's what /r/SadlyGoKarts is all about.



Since we last featured /r/SadlyGoKarts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/828zdc/march_5th_2018_rsadlygokarts_features_excitedly/) back in March of 2018, it's grown substantially, accumulating an extra 35 thousand subscribers to its name, and the quality hasn't droped since. For the confused, the name arises from a scene in the show Breaking Bad, where one of the characters is... Well, sadly go karting, [and the subtitles reflect this](https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/5z5d4w/the_post_that_started_it_all/).

The sub is still filled with many amusing subtitles, from [movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/ahyowy/child_screaming/) and [tv shows](https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/ac3jdh/oh/), [hilarious typos](https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/7z356g/this_is_a_little_different_than_i_remember_it/) and [intentional jokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/7tady4/when_they_dont_pay_you_enough_for_the_work_you_do/), [adding way too much detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/8q597v/fully_and_easily/) and more. Also, [sad go karting](https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/8rrnwc/mods_are_asleep_upvote_sad_gokarting/), of course. In short, this sub is a collection of pure comedic subtitle gold for the world to see, and I recommend that you all for check it out as well!

&nbsp;

The societal expectation of a dad is one of a person who is stoic, shows little emotion and is overall just very ""manly"". In recent times this expectation has been getting less popular as people realise that everyone has emotions and that there shouldn't be an issue with expressing them; many dads and men in general still don't enjoy showing much sadness or emotion, which is fine, personality is a thing. But it still means that when we see big strong men showing emotion, it affects us a bit as well.

So when we see a dad crying his eyes out it tends to make us feel pretty emotional too. Case in point, like everything in r/HappyCryingDads. The name explains the sub really; it's videos of dads shedding happy tears. In fact I don't believe there's much else to be said on it really; if you enjoy wholesome content and don't mind a little cry every now and then, this sub is perfect for you! I mean, watch [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/happycryingdads/comments/cwc6vy/dads_reaction_when_he_found_out_his_family_bought/) and tell me you didn't feel at least a bit of emotion. Or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/happycryingdads/comments/bkbw3b/after_losing_bruce_the_boston_terrier_his_family/). Or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/happycryingdads/comments/aaaor9/85yr_old_dad_cries_after_his_kids_track_down_his/) (especially that one). Or just any of the posts really.


In short, it's a wonderful sub and I recommend all of you to check it out if you want to add a little bit of wholesomeness into your day!

Have you ever seen a face that's been distorted because it was printed on the corner of a box, building, billboard, bus, etc.? Well, that is what this sub is about!

r/SplitFaced was original created to try and redirect and consolidate posts from other subs, namely r/CrappyDesign, of faces on box corners, distorted faces on signs and billboard, that sort of thing (GioFilms would hate this sub). Posts like this, are funny, and now this sub over the last year has grown to over 5,000 subscribers, and continues to grow.

r/BreathingBuddies is a meme subreddit a lot like r/HydroHomies, but on the topic of breathing instead

The creator was u/DeadPieGamer, and he(she?) has been active on the sub since day one. While the sub does not want people to smoke, the users choose not to bash smokers, but to respectfully talk with them about smoking, and offer help quitting if needed.

The sub is also part of /r/memelounge, which means it has a ""partnership"" with other meme subs, and will, therefore, have cross-sub events.

It also currently has an event, where if you donate money to teamtrees.org, you are to receive a special role on the Discord Server

r/HelicopterAddict is for fake and joking lyrics. The lyrics are usually inspired by the title of the song (sometimes taken literally) and the fake lyric websites are created using inspect element. For example, ""I Wonder"" by Kanye West has been turned into Kanye wondering out loud about how they fill up soda bottles and ""99 Problems"" by Jay Z has been turned into an actual list of 99 fake (albeit hilarious) problems. If you've ever heard ""Bad Guy"" and wondered what it would be like if it was actually about Billie ranting about Joker, or if ""Get Lucky"" was about winning the Powerball lottery, this sub is the place for you.

You must have read/heard about the short story, The Monkey's Paw, written by W.W. Jacobs. In case you haven't, here's a summary:

Man finds a monkey's paw which can grant wishes.

Man uses it and finds that its consequences are hellish.

Man gives it to another man, who refuses to believe.

Said man uses it, not believing the former's claim.

Man gets rekt.

Tampering with fate can lead to bad stuff.

----

^If ^you ^understood ^none ^of ^that, ^[here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw#Plot) ^a ^better ^version ^of ^the ^plot ^summary.

The Monkey's Paw is a subreddit which takes wishes, and twists them such that they come true, but with unintended consequences.

For example, what could happen if you wished that Xi Jingping released footage of himself eating honey, and saying ""oh, bother""? ^by ^the ^way, ^my ^social ^credit ^score
^just ^dropped

* Granted, but the Chinese government has a complete breakdown from within and all world trade comes grinding to a halt.

* (Granted. Having confronted his lone insecurity, Xi is fearless. Trade war? He scoffs. Uighur human rights violations? Try and stop him.

  China becomes the global hegemon, and with its hegemony comes a world of people with questionable hair cuts, undying subservience to the state, and a language that may have some poetic quality, but really just sounds a lot like shouting while having a stroke.

  Oh, d-d-d-d-d-dear.

* Granted. He is now banned from China too

Or if you wished that every time you were about to make a bad life decision, a troupe of Oompa Loompas would appear and sing a little song telling you not to be such a fucking idiot?

* Granted. You get to avoid poor life decisions but it comes at a cost. The Oompa Loompas do not disapear after their song as your wish did not include this important detail. So now 
you are stuck with an evergrowing population of Oompa Loompas that constantly follow you around.

* Granted. The oompa-loompas die horrible deaths from exhaustion! Dead oompa-loompas build up around you, decaying and spreading disease.

* Granted. Every time you make a bad life decision, even a minor one like not brushing your teeth before bed or not drinking enough water, Oompas give you a song. You get a new song 
averaging every 5 minutes, sometimes with multiple groups singing over each other.

Dead By Daylight is an asymmetrical horror/ressource management multiplayer game, where there are 4 survivors and 1 killer.

But then there is us... the killers! We need to find them, chase them to eventually down them and put them on sacrificial hooks so that they can be sacrificed to the Entity. You don’t want to displease it....

Here's what subreddit creator /u/orangevg had to say about the sub:

> r/triviaoftheday is a trivia sub that features a new and interesting trivia question every single day that everyone can answer. There's some friendly competition there in the form of points too, which is fun. Users are welcome to submit their own questions too. Also, we have weekly ""word walls"" in the style of the show Only Connect, and we currently have a tournament running between members. Also, we've recently crossed our 100th question!

So, if you're competitive by nature, go flex some brain muscles!

Learn the news through memes at Meme That News. We’re a subreddit where people post memes about current events. Meme That News is a way to stay in touch with current events through the medium of memes. Laugh while you learn what’s going on in the world in the quickest and most enjoyable way.

While there are lots of memes that comment on current events or take a specific photograph from a recent event and meme it, we found it difficult to find a subreddit where we can learn the news through memes. We wanted something like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert where the news is being critically commented on humorously, but at the same time it is being reported and you walk away entertained but also having learned something. We created r/MemeThatNews to provide that to the reddit community. Swing by and learn the day’s news while you laugh.

Here are some great posts from our members:

 Sub for the Netflix Original series: **Stranger Things**

The disappearance of a young boy sparks a chain of events leading the residents of the small town of Hawkins to uncover a government conspiracy and a supernatural mystery which will not only shatter all semblance of normality, but also threaten their very existence.

Since this is Netflix, all of the episodes dropped at once. Word is that there will be a second season that continues the story with most, if not all, of the cast returning. It's not yet confirmed, but it's one of those things that's ""all but.""

If you've already seen it, or some of it, and are just now finding this sub, join the conversation! If you're finding this post from /r/StrangerThings, then you already know it's awesome. If you haven't even heard of this show before now, I highly recommend it. Give it a chance and then find out what /r/StrangerThings users think.

This subreddit was forged about the same time the economy went to hell, lamenting the sorry state of the economy, the problems of an educated (and sometimes over-educated) young workforce having troubles finding employment despite ""doing everything right"", and just what this generation is supposed to do when the usual markers of adulthood (kids, house, marriage) have been pushed back in the name of higher education/income potential, along with the collective reorganization of a new set of values.
 
/r/Lostgeneration supports the Working Class. No promotion of reactionary, anti-worker ideology. This applies to your post history. Maintain solidarity with all workers whom, on top of being exploited by the rich and corporations, belong to groups and minorities that suffer specific oppressions under capitalism. No Xenophobia, Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, or Imperialist/Interventionist apologia.

r/wholesome is a 5 year old community, which only really properly opened  in June this year after a successful reddit request. The previous mods had the sub set on restricted, so in the space between when the sub was created and June this year, no one was able to submit content. We thought the sub had potential to be a competitor to similar subs like r/MadeMeSmile, r/HumansBeingBros etc.  
  
The subreddit is pretty self explanatory, it’s a sub where any wholesome content is allowed to be posted. We didn’t really want to be super strict in regards to what content would be allowed since we did want to grow the sub before we thought about restricting certain content. Think of it as a “more free” r/MadeMeSmile and the like.
  
Here's some examples:

[Wholesome Christmas]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesome/comments/d1jfuu/wholesome_christmas/)  
  
r/wholesome is the place for content that makes you smile. Whether that be someone who would inspire others, or a human doing something kind for another human. Basically any content that makes the viewer feel good, is allowed.   
  
So if you need to feel good, come on over and visit us!

*What is* **Cyberpunk?**

*A genre of science fiction and a lawless subculture in an oppressive society dominated by computer technology and big corporations. Hmmm...It feels like the world we live in today.*

Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction. 
Comics exploring cyberpunk themes began appearing as early as Judge Dredd, first published in 1977. Released in 1984, William Gibson's influential debut novel Neuromancer would help solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from punk subculture and early hacker culture. Other influential cyberpunk writers included Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira, with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre.

Early films in the genre include Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner, one of several of Philip K. Dick's works that have been adapted into films. The films Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and New Rose Hotel (1998), both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. The Matrix trilogy (1999-2003) were some of the most successful cyberpunk films. More recent additions to this genre of filmmaking include Blade Runner 2049 (2017), sequel to the original 1982 film, as well as Upgrade (2018), Alita: Battle Angel (2019) based on the 1990s Japanese manga Battle Angel Alita, and the 2018 Netflix TV series Altered Carbon. 

If it's cyberpunk, you can post it, no matter the year or the style of the content, city pics, political articles, social discussions, latest novels, you name it, you can post it here!

/r/marijuanaenthusiasts is a place to share pictures of your favorite trees. Some shots are well-timed and others are creative and some folks get to share their professional enthusiasm. The subreddit itself has been a warm and wholesome community long before being nice became a meme. They welcome all kinds, from the pretty, the twisted, to the freaky and even the gory.

You might be wondering why the name for a subreddit dedicated to trees, well 10 years ago a group established the blazing pothole that is /r/trees and it has sprouted irreversibly into the place for weed, pineapples, and other drug paraphernalia. But proper dendrophiliacs felt there was lack of tree appreciation on the site. So once they put down their own roots, they naturally pulled the old reddit spruce-a-roo. But since users are easily confused, they'll teach you how to get high.

From saplings that look like twigs, up to giant-ass redwoods you can drive through, /r/marijuanaenthusiasts has got something for the arborist in us all. It's the perfect time to go check them out too, with Autumn in full force, you can look at some beautiful pics with like, all these far-out colors and shapes.

In 2013, Warner Bros. released Man of Steel, the first film in a new and unified cinematic continuity starring the iconic characters of DC Comics. This subreddit is a fan community dedicated to news and discussion pertaining to these new DC films, past DC films (ex: The Dark Knight Trilogy, Watchmen), animated DC films (ex: Batman: Under the Red Hood), and film adaptations of Vertigo Comics (ex: the upcoming The Kitchen).

With a dedicated group of moderators and loyal core of members this is one of the best subreddits in my opinion, though I may be extremely biased because this is by far my favorite subreddit on reddit. While its had its controversy and drama its moderators go above and beyond to keep posts and topics above board. With the countless rumors they make sure to only allow credible sources.

Whether you're a fan of all the films, just the DCEU films, only the Nolan films..etc this is the place for you. lets celebrate these wonderful movie!

Keanu Reeves, who is known around the world for his performances in such films as John Wick and The Matrix, Bill and Ted..etc For someone with as much success as him, its truly refreshing to see how great of a person he seems to be. 

I'll put some examples of his awesome IRL moments.

*  *The stories of Keanu’s on-set antics are less diva, more total legend. Yeah, he got shitloads for fronting The Matrix in 1999 – but chose to give a huge chunk (totalling a reported $75 million) of his earnings for the second two films, to the special effects guys and people behind the scenes whom he felt deserved it more.*

*  *Also, when he was at the height of his heartthrob status, Keanu took a $2 million pay cut for The Devil’s Advocate, so the studio would be able to afford to hire Al Pacino as the lead. He also took a reported 90 per cent pay cut on The Replacements so they could hire Gene Hackman. And, best of all, is this story from Reddit:*

*  *‘A family friend builds movie sets, doesn’t design, is one of the poor dudes that just builds. Anyways he worked on the set for The Matrix and Keanu heard about family trouble he was having and gave him a $20,000 Christmas bonus to help him out. He also was one of the only people on the set that genuinely wanted to know people’s names, would say hello and mean it, and would talk to people as they were his peers and not below him just because they were practically making nothing to build a set. I’ve never heard anyone say Keanu is douche, seems like the nicest person in Hollywood from a second hand experience.’*

There are many many more!

 r/behindthegifs is all about the story behind the gifs. What events took place to make the creator form it in such a way that this gif came to be? HOW? This subreddit solves that mystery and more. One part comedic genius, One part mspaint or better artistic skills, and finally one part gif.

Most of the submitters can consistently bring about high quality content, and I always have a good laugh reading through the top posts and the comments. Honestly, it's the same as the better parts of reddit. Not too many people troll in the comments, and those that do are quickly voted down and reported. The sub's full of great people.

 Welcome to r/Demotivational, the part of Reddit designed to make you feel hopeless and useless. Enjoy your stay. Or like, don't.

The funniest demotivational posters not only make us laugh and shake our heads but prove once and for all that trying is really not worth it. These posters mock the inspirational and serene motivational posters by showing the unfortunate side of each situation. Sure, some posters will give you hope and lift your spirits, but how many keep it real like the best demotivational posters?

Rather than painting a rosy picture of how awesome your life could be, these funny demotivational posters tell it how it is. Why pay for college when so-called reality stars will always make more than you? Think you have bad luck? Try being in the wrong place at the wrong time with a bull on the loose. Think you're getting a great deal on eBay? Yeah, there's a reason it's a fraction of the price.

/r/NeedAMod is a place where you can obtain moderators for your subreddit, or become one yourself. There is lots of activity there, as, of course, there are hundreds of thousands of subs out there, which all need people to run them. So if you feel you want to try and become a mod, /r/NeedAMod is the place for you.



 Moderating is an integral part of reddit, and everyone has the ability to become a mod. Simply go to http://www.reddit.com and click on ""create a community"" in the sidebar. Fill out a few fields and hey presto, you are a mod. You can also be added as a moderator to communities which you participate in, often simply by showing interest in the subreddit and being available. Some moderators have great ability with scripts and css (cascading style sheets) but many have no computer skills beyond the ability to navigate to reddit.

All mods share a common trait; they were interested in the subject matter of the community they help to moderate at some point. This might not seem like sufficient cause to become a mod, but in fact reddit actually needs your help to run properly.

Mods will find endless activities to keep themselves occupied; clearing the modqueue is merely the tip of the iceberg. Curating your wiki, learning and implementing new css, promoting the community, and making decisions (sometimes unpopular ones) regarding content all fall into the scope of a moderator's duties. There are many reddit personalities who are famous (or infamous) for being mods, and while being a squeaky clean moderator can be very rewarding, more than a few wind up on the frontpage of subredditdrama.

Each subreddit's mod team will have a different way of interacting with their community. Some are in constant communication, with many topics adorned with the green [M] for subscribers to review and comment on. Some groups will have a single spokesperson, and some will have a group account which each mod knows the password to. One thing is for sure though; when you become a moderator it doesn't make you better or more knowledgeable than another redditor.

r/TraceAnObject is a subreddit dedicated to increasing awareness and viewership of images posted on the EUROPOL ""Trace an Object"" website to increase the chances of an object being correctly identified. Each image posted is done so officially by a subreddit moderator, along with the case number associated with it in the title. 

The website that the subreddit is assisting is the official website for the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, or EUROPOL. In specific, the images posted are in an attempt to identify details in the background of an image to help solve cases of child exploitation after all other avenues of investigation have been used. EUROPOL is requesting details on the potential location of an image, or any discernible details of the visible features. The subreddit is purely designed to raise awareness of the images posted to the official website and any information should be submitted to the official Trace an Object EUROPOL website.

/r/KickOpenTheDoor is a subreddit that has been gaining a lot of traction lately, going from ~800 to 2000+ subscribers in just 24 hours! Why, you may wonder? Well because the idea behind the subreddit is brilliant. Every day (or couple of hours), a new ""boss"" is posted for the community to take down. This boss can be a mythical creature, pop culture reference or even an inside joke. Users can then comment and deal damage to the boss through the subreddit's wonderful bot. There are even leaderboards for most XP gained and most boss KOs! Having participated in this subreddit myself, I can tell you that it is a blast and with more improvements coming to the bot system, you can be sure that you will have a good time. And, if you have an idea for a boss, don't forget to join r/KOTD's discord, as they draw on ideas from there quite frequently.

**A Hidden Mickey** is a representation of Mickey Mouse that has been inserted subtly into the design of a ride, attraction, or other location in a Disney theme park, Disney properties, animated film, feature-length movie, TV series, or other Disney product. The most common Hidden Mickey is a formation of three circles that may be perceived as the silhouette of the head and ears of Mickey Mouse, often referred to by Disney aficionados as a ""Classic Mickey"".Mickeys may be painted, made up of objects (such as rocks, or three plates on a table), or be references such as someone wearing Mickey Mouse Club ears in a painting. Hidden Mickeys can take on many sizes and forms.

Hidden Mickeys are slipped into many Disney animated films as Easter eggs. They are also hidden in architecture and attractions in Disney parks and resorts, and in studio buildings and many other Disney-related features. This is a subreddit for displaying the hidden mickeys you have found check it out!

Becoming a mod on Reddit is pretty easy to do, but once they hand you the keys to a sub you're basically on your own. There isn't any proactive training or instruction. Oh, there are lots of resources available if you want to visit a half dozen subs and read subreddit wikis that many users never even know exist.

A system like that is bound to lead to inconsistency in moderation style, education, and competence. What if there was a better way?

If you browse any of the mod help subs you'll see that lots of first time and less experienced mods have questions about the most basic mod functions and abilities. New users on r/modhelp sometimes get ignored because answers to their questions are found with an easy search. Who knows if they ever find those links.

There is a better way to onboard users to Reddit moderation.

r/ModGuide is a new community for mods by mods to teach and learn about all aspects of moderation on Reddit. Posts will be made by hand-selected writers and indexed in the wiki, but all members can comment and add their resources and advice on the topics covered. It's a sub where new mods can seek help from more experienced mods without fear of thinking they're asking a stupid question -- in fact, it is actively encouraged!

If you're a new Reddit mod, or maybe you've thought about becoming one and starting your own community, or you're an experienced mod that likes to help new mods learn the ropes, please stop by r/ModGuide and see what we're up to. Better and more consistent moderation across Reddit helps improve the community for everyone. Come take part and help us grow a community.

/r/robots focuses on things like videos of real robots, robot art, robot history, retro toy robots, literature and film recommendations or discussions that primarily focus on (real or fictional) robots. Technical questions about robotics subsystems, etc. are more for r/robotics.

Here is what moderator /u/runvnc had to say:

>About three or four weeks ago, I noticed that there was quite a lot of spam showing up in my feed under r/robots. It was actually almost all from one user who was trying to promote a video game. I made some posts complaining and when the mod finally woke up, he did the responsible thing and added someone else as a mod.

>The first thing I did was, I asked if anyone else wanted to be mods also in case I fell asleep. *Rich6031-5* and *nutbastard* volunteered. Secondly, I noticed that we had an identity problem: r/robots seemed on the surface extremely similar to r/robotics, and also the old.reddit description claimed that the sub was exclusively for fictional robots. Yet almost everything being posted to the sub was real robots.

>So I asked the community, and we clarified that no one cared about the old idea of having r/robots exclusively allowing robot art, and actually most people were not particularly interested in answering technical questions or discussing subsystems. They just wanted robots of all kinds.

>We needed a design, so I asked the community to submit some in a contest thread. Its a very small community and no one seemed to have time, (except my brother showed it to my nephew Logan who created kind of a funny banner. LOL). So I went got a couple of people to create competing designs. One of them by *danavinette* was perfect, and the other by *grayves* had really good upvote/downvote icons. So we went with them.

>We welcome everyone to come and check out the subreddit for any discussions related to robots.

Example quotes:

Now see, don't get me wrong. I love /r/Pics for all the photos and the stories attached to them. They've got happy pictures, sad pictures, aww pictures and generally a lot of pictures. But sometimes, you don't want to read stories about the pictures. Maybe, you just want to look at a photo and appreciate it by itself. No context.

This is where /r/NoContextPics comes in. Here's what subreddit moderator /u/ClayBurn had to say:

>We got started because /r/pics submissions relied too heavily on context (sob stories, personal triumphs, etc.) instead of the actual quality of the pictures. So, we wanted a place where each image had to succeed or fail purely on its own merits. No bias from backstories or titles.

>Despite the name, context is allowed in the comments.

>We held a Best of 2018, and plan to do so again for 2019. You can see 2018 winner's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontextpics/comments/ans7sx/rnocontextpics_best_of_2018_winners/). We also had a really fun April Fool's this year where we required every submission include a sob story headline.

>Ever so often a user will recommend our subreddit as a good alternative to /r/pics, and we get a flood of new users. The community is great and we have several strong mods helping us maintain quality.

Science is fucking cool. There's no other way to say it, really. Everything you do, say, think, see, or don't see, is made up of trillions of things happening all at once, that we perceive as a tiny part of our daily life. We literally cannot comprehend the scale of the world around us; we're collosal beings in a universe that exists in the nanoscopic. And we're not even that large in our macroscopic world. It's enough to bring any man to an existential crisis when they think about it enough.



And oftentimes, when billions of those nanoscopic things happen, they will create a macroscopic effect that we call an ""observation"". Whether that's something being propelled a couple millimetres or a stick of dynamite going off, it's all the same things: particles interacting with eachother, at a rate so blazingly fast that we can't even notice it with the naked eye, until we see the macroscopic effect. Generally these events fall into 2 categories: Physics, and Chemistry. Physics being the rules of how those things interact and behave (disgusting oversimplification that hurts to type), and chemistry being the properties of those things (that we call ""particles), how they interact with eachother, and how they form up and create the world around us (still a horrible oversimplification but not as bad as they physics one). Then there's biology. Poor biology. Only significant on a single tiny rock in a single tiny portion of the gigantic universe, that we call Earth (just kidding, biology's pretty cool).




/r/ChemicalReactionGifs is a sub for... Well, GIFs of chemical reactions. All sorts of cool reactions that can produce beautiful effects, whether it's a [cool colour change](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/7xiqco/on_par_with_black_magic_fuckery/) a [really cool colour change](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/7tcp5u/anodizing_titanium/), a [violent explosion](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/8476m4/pure_alcohol_and_lithium_aluminum_hydride/), a [surprising chance in physical properties](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/7coi30/mercury_devouring_gold_sheets/), or [all 3 of those at once](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/686c5j/cesium_reacts_with_water/). They're all welcome in this sub. If you're interested in chemistry, then I'd highly recommend this sub for the educational aspect of it; I know I've personally learned quite a bit from just casually browsing it. And if you're not interested, then I'm sure you can still appreciate the awesome reactions that it's filled with.

Enduring the college admissions process is hard, but enduring it alone is even harder. So don’t do it alone! At /r/ApplyingToCollege (or A2C, as it’s commonly dubbed), you’ll find a vibrant and diverse community dedicated to the sole venture of getting into ~~Harvard~~ college. Whether you’re starting the Common App, forming a school list, searching for essay advice, or celebrating a recent acceptance, A2C is the place for you. 

Notably, the subreddit includes AMAs from college students and admissions officers, detailed guides to conquering your interviews, an *impressively* accomplished pool of high school students, and much more. If you seem to be having a rougher time than most, not to worry—A2C also functions as a positive support space for anyone who may be struggling through the application process. Most importantly, all of these resources are catered to students and 100% free!

If you’ve been looking for a reason to stop procrastinating on that whole “eating healthy” thing, /r/diet is your answer. The subreddit is a hub for all discussion related to dieting and health. Come for answers to your [dying questions about nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/d6gtse/on_average_men_can_eat_2000_cals_per_day_and_not/), to share [diet-related news](https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/d6bfxp/mind_diet_foods_that_fight_alzheimersdementia/), or even to post [interesting recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/chysdg/protein_smoothies_make_this_easier/)!

A common misconception is that you need to be knowledgeable about dieting before you participate in the subreddit. Au contraire, my friend. While having prior knowledge is important for giving out advice to your fellow dieters, you can participate in many other aspects of the subreddit with absolutely no dieting experience whatsoever—feel free to pop in if you have even the slightest curiosity! If you’re feeling extra adventurous, join the official /r/diet Discord community, pinned to the front page of the subreddit!

Take a look at some of the top posts from this month:

1. **Success:** [My diet for past 2 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/cy3yoe/my_diet_for_past_2_months/)
2. **Discussion:** [Sugar is added to so many foods in America.](https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/d2aq24/sugar_is_added_to_so_many_foods_in_america/)
3. **Question:** [Is my diet a good diet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/d8t0si/is_my_diet_a_good_diet/)

Hope to see you there!

We've all seen movies being remade, for a number of reasons. Some of them turn out well. Like The Jungle Book, It: Chapter One, or Mad Max: Fury Road. A lot of them are just not worth it. (Looking at you, Robocop and The Lion King).

/r/PastAndPresentPics is a subreddit which works on the same premise. People recreate old photos and create new memories. You might not be in these photos, but they'll get you feeling nostalgic, or right in the feels, always. 

Maybe, you'll remember all the times you and your siblings used to play together. You might reminiscence about the time you went vacationing with your fam. Or the pets you had. Or some random memory from your childhood coming back to you. You might feel maudlin and misty-eyed. Or you'd feel content. Either way, you'll move on. As you always do. Because time never stops.

So go ahead, take a trip down memory lane. Doesn't have to be yours. Let the past guide your present, and help you decide your future.

**2,695** *subscribers* for **7 years**!

&nbsp;

^(*Dooo dooo do-do dooo duuuuu, dooo dooo do-do dooo duu-*)

*Ahem.*

Lightning is pretty sweet. When you're a kid it's a mixture of terrifying and fucking awesome, and when you're an adult... Well, it's basically the same. Throughout history, humanity has been equal parts fascinated and awestruck by it. I mean, imagine being a lowly peasant 2000 years ago, just minding your own business, when suddenly a big fuckoff blast of light comes down from the sky and eviscerates your humble abode with the might of Zeus himself. At the time people didn't have the knowledge of what causes lightning, so it was just assumed that it was punishment from a higher power, for wearing multiple types of fabric or looking at a lady's ankles or whatever. Of course, we know what it is now; in the wise words of Ken M:

> ""grandma used to say that thunder was the sound of angels creating a sonic shock wave in response to lightning's expansion of air I miss her""

And as climate change begins to truly fuck up the earth and the world sees more large storms than ever, there's one shining beacon of light, both literally and figuratively, and that's that we'll see a lot more cool lightning pictures! ^(*~~cries in young adult who's going to have to live through the previous generations' mess~~*)

If you've not already guessed, /r/Lightning is simply a subreddit to post cool pictures of lightning. It's a simple concept yet one that has an appeal to really anyone. Because as I've echoed throughout this feature, lightning is really cool. There's not much else to say really; it's in the subreddit name. This is simply a good subreddit which has high quality posts about lightning, and I recommend that all should check it out!

And I do feel that I have to mention the moderation of this subreddit too, because it's really unique in the redditsphere. /r/Lightning is moderated democratically. Mods are elected through elections done in /r/DemocracyExperiment (read the SRotD feature for that [here!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/basx0y/april_8th_2019_rdemocracyexperiment_democracy_is/)), rules are passed through the legislative process, if you feel your post was removed incorrectly you can make an appeal, and if you feel a mod is overstepping their position, you can bring it up with the rest of the public. Outside of subreddits made specifically for emulating democracy, as far as I can tell, this has never been done before (on this scale at least; perhaps there have been tiny subs that have done something similar). So perhaps this subreddit could be a precursor for a new way of moderating on Reddit? We'll just have to wait and find out.

**3,897** drivers for **7 years!**

Mustangs certainly have a special allure to them, they came out at the right time to be just a bit different. Mustangs were a sporty 2 door car that can be had by younger buyers with smaller budgets with base models with six cylinders, as well as optioned out to have the big engines and luxury features desired by those that afford it and all those in between. These classic Mustang came in bodystyles of convertibles, coupes, and fastback and had packages that are still legendary today with 'Mach 1"", ""Cobra Jet"" and ""Boss"" as big names still remembered today. Ford found a huge audience and managed to sell hundreds of thousands each year. This is great for current fans too, because these cars are available in large numbers just waiting to be restored. Parts are plentiful, both original and aftermarket, and knowledge is seemingly infinite about these pony cars. Pop culture has also influenced their prestige in car culture with movies such as Bullitt and Gone in 60 Seconds.

The Mustang has changed a fair bit  since it's inception. Each generation has had its differences, but each of them a Mustang that in someway embodied a piece of the originals. Current models are the sixth generation.of the pony car. Technological advances make this one of the best Mustangs yet. Beautiful, sporty, affordable, just like the originals. However, to those of us that hang around in the sub and millions of other fans, it's hard to beat the classic body lines and feel of these car's from the 1960's and '70s.

In terms of ""Classic Mustangs"" we generally accept cars from the first generation of Mustang that start with the 1965 model year and conclude with the 1973 model (although one could argue that this generation could easily be divided into sub-generations). The later 1974 to 1978 Mustang II cars are also welcome, but they have not built the same reputation the first generation has, and their appearance is sparse. Later generations have their own subreddits as well as the all encompassing /r/Mustang subreddit

My favorite post's are those of users sharing their own cars. These are clearly the favorite of userbase as well as indicated by the top posts of the sub. Technical posts and discussions posts are certainly encouraged as well. One of my main focus on managing this sub and some of my other subreddits 
 like /r/EngineBuilding  and /r/MuscleCar is to eliminate the 'porn' posts. You know the subs (often with the 'porn' suffix at the end) where people vote on the pretty picture and move on, I did not want this for my subs. I see it as low effort and does not lead to any meaningful discussion. We have rules in place to try and ensure that some details are included with each post to have a better quality sub.",1568804818.0,2019-09-18 13:06:58

Justice comes in many different shapes and sizes. Some, small things that don't matter too much. Some, large events that get news coverage and everything (see /r/JusticeServed for more like that). But the best type of justice, the most satisfying, is the type that you deal yourself. Welcome to /r/ProRevenge, the subreddit where you'll find the greatest, truly epic stories of taking the shit someone gave to OP, and OP giving it right back to them with a vengeance (that's quite literally what ""revenge"" means, after all).


There's 3 tiers of ""revenge"" subreddits; /r/PettyRevenge, /r/RegularRevenge, and /r/ProRevenge. The latter is only for the best if the best, the stuff that isn't just an excellent display of self-dealt justice, but a story, something that encapsulates the reader and keeps them going through. All of the posts on /r/ProRevenge are excellent; entertaining, funny, and satisfying as fuck. Due to the high standard of content, posts themselves can, admittedly, be rather scarce at times, but when a post is allowed up you can be sure it'll be a good one.


There's many excellent stories in this sub, and I can hardly talk about them all. This is one of those subs that you can spend hours just browsing the top posts of, and I've done it before. There are some true classics there, like [the time Apple got fucked in the small claims court for being pompous assholes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/8pocxv/apples_holierthanthou_attitude_is_their_undoing/), [the asshole manager who OP got fired via their own shady practices] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/7pr9wk/my_manager_was_an_awful_person_to_me_but_i_got/), and countless more. It'd be a sin for me to sit here and try and summarise them in a single sentence, the posts are long but I can't recommended enough that you read some of the top posts in the sub.

Overall, this subreddit is one of those ones that everyone should at least know about. Everyone loves a good revenge story, and there's nowhere that does them better than /r/ProRevenge.

If you are like me and love Film and Art then I have the subreddit for you! /r/MoviePosterPorn is a safe for work image based sub dedicated to sharing movie posters. They have a format for their posts that keeps the sub neat and tidy and extremely pleasant to navigate. If you want to see a poster for one of your favorite films you are bound to find it on here.

I found the sub while browsing Reddit and saw this really sick movie poster for the movie [""*Predator""*](https://i.imgur.com/DwqMbPo.jpg). They have a great [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/wiki/index?v=adb1a576-5770-11e8-9857-0e77d0f2c6e0) where they describe Why some hosts allowed while others are not or if you post as well as helping you with various other questions.

Another fantastic feature is when you post a movie poster they have a bot called ""*u/MovieGuide""* that comments information about the movie posted  such as the title, synopsis, who the director and some of the actors are. It also shares the link for more information on the film at IMDb, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix, Wikidata..etc.  

**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

/r/Bose is about products and discussions about the audio manufacturer BOSE. We are not an official subreddit and are not affiliated with BOSE in any way. This is an advantage, but we'll come to that!

/r/bose is a very interesting and special place on Reddit. Not only is our community incredibly helpful and responsive to all concerns surrounding Bose products, but we also have something to celebrate at the moment: [We have just reached 10,000 users and are celebrating with a small giveaway of a brand new Bose headset for FREE](https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/cuqtu3/rbose_is_celebrating_10000_members_with_a_free/), which the mods pay out of their own pocket.

Furthermore, our community has something really interesting going on: Bose sells one of the most recognized NC headphones in the world: the QC35. Almost simultaneously with the release of another model, the NC 700, numerous media and users reported problems with the QC35, causing high media coverage on YouTube and other media channels. [The /r/Bose Reddit community was cited directly and as a reliable source for firmware updates and problem solving.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/cyue1q/new_update_from_bose_about_bose_qc_35_ii_firmware/) This shows: Not only do we love BOSE, but we can also criticize BOSE when appropriate. 

That's what makes /r/Bose so special: **We stick together to support what we enjoy; Audio products that we can both love and hate.**

 /r/ItTheMovie is dedicated to the films based on the 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King. It was his 22nd book, and his 18th novel written under his own name. The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by an evil entity that exploits the fears and phobias of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. ""It"" primarily appears in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown to attract its preferred prey of young children. 

It premiered in Los Angeles on September 5, 2017, and was released in the United States on September 8, 2017, in 2D and IMAX. The film set numerous box office records and has grossed over $700 million worldwide.Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing R-rated horror film of all-time, the highest-grossing horror film internationally and the highest-grossing horror film of all time.  It received positive reviews, with critics praising the performances, direction, cinematography and musical score, and many calling it one of the best Stephen King adaptations. It received numerous awards and nominations, earning two Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association nominations, including Best Acting Ensemble.  It was nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Sci-Fi/Horror Movie. The film won three Bogey Awards, for pulling in more than two million German admissions in 11 days.  In addition, the motion picture has been named as one of the best films of 2017 by various ongoing critics, appearing on several critic's end-of-year lists.

/r/MovieMistakes is a subreddit that shows you all of the mistakes from famous movies such as Star Wars, Back to the future etc. 

Mistakes can be anything that  reveal the film-making process, visible crew or equipment, plot holes, audio problems, and character mistakes. 



[One of the most famous mistake is the the stormtrooper hitting his head in Star Wars  Episode IV - A New Hope.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBQaLuqwtl8&f) In the 2004 DVD re-release of the original trilogy, the ""head-bumping stormtrooper"" bump was enhanced with an obvious sound effect to draw more attention to the gaffe. 


[Another famous mistake is from the movie Quantum of Solace.] (https://i.imgur.com/nARUTK9.gif) An extra in the background of the Port-au-Prince scene is meant to be sweeping the ground, but his broom is not on the floor; he is merely miming sweeping motions.



The subreddit recently has enjoyed being on the trending subreddits, and in turn enjoying more traffic and subscribers. 




**Here's a taste of what you can find on /r/MovieMistakes:**

Ahh yes - Memeology. [Defined as the study of memes](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Memeology), /r/askmemeologists is the place to go for meta discussions about memes, their origins and their evolution. Whether you are an old or a new memer we can all talk about memes. 

You may ask yourself: “How can you study memes?” Well that’s simple. You discuss the history of a meme template, request templates, or learn about memes in general.

Dedicated to one of it not the greatest character ever created ""**Batman""** published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Originally named the ""Bat-Man,"" the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.

Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. His origin depicts Bruce Wayne as a child, after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.

Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers. He does, however, possess a genius-level intellect, is a peerless martial artist, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary arsenal of weaponry and equipment. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker. 

Content must be related to Batman or Batman-affiliated characters and stories, whether it may pertain to the comics, films, television shows, or video games. Posts with the explicit intention to push an agenda or political belief will be removed at moderator's discretion.

For enthusiastic Batman fans who are eager to engage with the community check out this subreddit, as well as [their Discord Server!](https://discordapp.com/invite/batman)

This is a subreddit dedicated, solely, to the lord of immersion, Henry 'MxR' Liang, and his lady, Jeannie 'PotasticPanda' Lee. Henry is a Taiwanese-American born in Long Island, New York. Before he started doing reviews for Skyrim mods, he did reviews for MMO games such as Atlantica, MapleStory and Guild Wars, hence the name MMOxReview. Henry has attended the Boston University (in the field of Engineering) but eventually dropped out to pursue a career as a YouTuber. 

MxR is mostly known for reviewing mods in series called ""Skyrim Mods Weekly"" and ""Fallout 4 Mods Weekly"". Both currently have 252 and 90 episodes respectively and counting. As of early 2017, both of his well-known series will now have an alternating upload schedule. 
 
In December 2016, MxR took over what was originally Jeannie's channel and changed the name to MxR Plays where its contents are focused on Gaming and Vlogs. Here, MxR will have the freedom to post any gaming or vlog related content, some featuring potasticpanda (original channel owner). This channel will have a daily upload schedule and occasionally live stream.

We're a subreddit dedicated to the historical aspects of the Titanic- with a focus on education, serious discussion, and sharing documentation. Other Titanic subreddits appear to be fairly unmoderated and unfocused, I was frustrated with the constant low effort memes and misinformation I found on them, which is why I created /r/rms_titanic. We just hit 800 subscribers and with the recent dive to the wreck site I expect we will have a lot more exciting information on our sub soon.

For those visiting [I'd start with our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/RMS_Titanic/comments/87kur9/frequently_asked_questions_and_dispelling_popular/) which has a lot of interesting information and dispels some frequently cited myths.

/r/Tribes1 is an independently run fan subreddit based on the 1990s PC video game series Starsiege: Tribes created by Dynamix and Sierra and later sold to VUGames and eventually HiRez.

The /r/tribes1 subreddit has a pro-consumer ethics and transparency critical slant in discussing changes to the game series. Open game modding, and the core strafe-jump movement mechanic called skiing that helped make the game famous, as well as its class-based armor loadouts that are bought at inventory stations or through options menus is discussed on /r/tribes1. E-Sports History and the giant panoramic vistas of the in-game map terrains and the making of them are all discussed on the subreddit as well.

From the Subreddit sidebar:
""VODs and discussions of Starsiege: Tribes that show its diverse gameplay and modality. Any mod or config or style of play is supported. Rare footage, recordings of competitive matches and feats of legendary skill, guides, forum talks, encouraged to be linked and archived.
This Subreddit promotes consumer ethics and analysis.
This Subreddit isn't affiliated with http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/ or /r/Tribes or Hi-Rez Studios and supports free and open posting within the context of the Tribes series and especially Tribes 1.""

One particularly interesting topic covered in the subreddit is the dumbing down or ""simplifying"" of the series gameplay over time to appeal to a broader audience like console players. One of Video Game History's first Professional Gamer's lamented on this fact in a post on TribalWar Forums titled, ""Why I'm Not Playing Tribes 2 - By Natural"", which can be found here and on the /r/tribes1 subreddit sidebar: http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49195

As well as Tribes 2's Lead Developer Qix's Learned Lessons and mistakes in making Tribes 2 is also linked in the Important Reads Sidebar: http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?p=10714144#post10714144

Pro-Player Opsayo's opinion on the differences in movement mechanics between the games is also linked as an Important Read:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Midair/comments/3jftgc/assisting_new_players/cv0yfn9

Aside from the Important Reads section of the Sidebar on the Reddit, there's, and Game Resource section, that connects new viewers directly to the community and the game with easy installations, configurations, gameplay guides, and one-click discord as the game is FreeWare.

r/sushi is the largest sushi-related subreddit, with thousands of daily users and over 200,000 views in the past month alone. It's a best place on Reddit to post your photos of that sushi you just ate (or made), ask questions, or just talk about your favorite nigiri and maki with other sushi enthusiasts. People share traditional multi-course tasting menus, and rolls they got from their favorite place down the street.

And r/sushi is also sporting a redesign along with all new sushi themed Community Awards! Drop and by and share a roll or two.


Here's a small taste of some of the most popular post on r/sushi in the last month:

**This is not a place to bring your hatred of Americans or America- we like to keep things friendly and toxic attitudes are not welcome**



_______

/r/ShitAmericansSay is a subreddit well to show the shit Americans say, couldn't get any easier than that. Here we look at the obsession with a piece of cloth, guns, and saying freedom every two seconds. 





Mass shootings are a regular occurrence in America. ""As of July 31, 2019, 248 mass shootings have occurred in 2019. This averages out to 1.2 shootings per day. In these shootings, 979 people were injured and 246 died (for a total of 1,325 victims).""



In 2012, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting happened where 27 people were killed including 20 children between six and seven years old.
The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting prompted renewed debate about gun control in the United States, including proposals for making the background-check system universal, and for new federal and state legislationbanning the sale and manufacture of certain types of semi-automatic firearms and magazines with more than ten rounds of ammunition.
The National Rifle Association said gun-free school zones attract killers and that another gun ban would not protect Americans. He called on Congress to appropriate funds to hire armed police officers for every American school and announced that the NRA would create the National School Shield Emergency Response Program to help.

______




Some Americans have an absolute obsession with the American flag, where they would actually risk their life to save a piece of cloth made in China,  that you could just buy another one with ease. [Flag disposal boxes] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/McK_Park_Lib_Flag_Disposal.jpg/250px-McK_Park_Lib_Flag_Disposal.jpg) are quite common in public areas such as libraries; ""The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free."" Seems quite a few patriotic Americans don't abide with this rule.

__________


When the 17th of March arrives the Plastic Paddy's come out of the woodwork and say that they're 1/64 Irish. They usually just use this as an excuse to get absolutely steaming. Good for local businesses that the Plastic Paddy's are in town. 



In 1969 when the troubles started in the north of Ireland a large amount of firearms in Ireland was coming from American supporters of the PIRA. This continued into the 1980s and 1990s. [More reading of this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_arms_importation#Timeline:_The_IRA's_importation_of_weapons)


 Some Americans still support car bombs and shootings in the north of Ireland, there is also a drink called Irish Car Bomb which is absolutely absurd name for a drink.

First let me tell you that I am amazed and honored that you love our sub r/CollectingDragonBall !! This little idea started to form when I bought my first figure 8 months ago and couldn't find a truly kind and positive place to enjoy it with. There was something missing on Reddit and we needed to fill that void. We started this sub back in the last week of June and never looked back, we have found you guys and you have found us!!

I am just like everyone here, Dragon Ball is what makes me happy and is the one constant good in my life. I created this sub to give people like us a home and a chance to come together and have a family that loves and supports each Other no matter what. I believe you guys proved that is what we do here. We do a Damn good job of it!

We are dedicated to the human connection we all share and have a very special bond with Dragon Ball that transcends the written words and the T.V. Series and it becomes our life. We all have been through tough times or been told no when we try to do something that rocks the boat and shakes things up! What gets us past these things? We have all had relationships end badly or turn toxic, but what reminds us that it doesn't take our sharing and caring away from each other ?

We have also all experienced the joys and pleasure life brings. We may not all have children but the ones that do get to share something that is so special with someone they care for. I have been told by many that the joy on their kiddo's faces and the excitement of seeing DB for the first time! I bet everyone of us was that same little kid and was so drawn in and found pure happiness in DB.

Well now We can share that with the world!!! We have the ability to impact lives on a human to human level and to remind each other that kindness and compassion do exist and they are worth fighting for!!! We can inspire each other to achieve higher goals, we can support each other when we are down, we glow with positivity ( or maybe we are just turning SSJ ) , we have the gift and the honor of bridging that gap between DB Collectors and DB fans. Think about how the smallest act of kindness turned Piccolo and Vegeta down the path to redemption and finding their true self!!!

This is how we make the world a better place and I feel honored so many of you are supporting this sub and its message. So I ask for you to continue to support this home we built, not for me but for this sub and for what we created together. They may try to take it away or to destroy it but this sub is one the thing that they will never take and that is r/CollectingDragonBall they may try to take away our special bond as DB collectors but they will fail. They can take away everything I have but the one thing they will never get is r/CollectingDragonBall. Because it doesn't belong to me or to them or even to reddit, it belongs to you and I promise to give you everything I have and every moment of my time and if you support this sub and this promise nothing and no one will take r/CollectingDragonBall from you! show that We are the embodiment of everything Dragon Ball is about!!

/r/Dota2 was [featured for the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/16ha4f/january_13_2013_rdota2_basshunters_second/) about 6 years ago, way back when the game required invites to join. Back then, the subreddit had 57k subscribers and the game averaged 250k concurrent players, which has grown to 584k subscribers and an average of over 500k concurrent players respectively, with the peak player count consistently hitting a million^[1](https://steamcharts.com/app/570).

""So what is DotA?"", you may ask. ~~It is a soulless void, into which once you enter, you cannot leave.~~ Here's the answer, from the previous feature,
>For those not in the know, Defense of the Ancients (DotA) was a mod for Warcraft III which was adapted into a standalone game by Valve called Dota 2. There are two teams with 5 players on each side. Each player gets to pick a hero and level them up choosing from 5 different abilities. The goal is to push with your team to the enemy's base and destroy it. It sounds simple(>!it isn't!<). Easy to pick up, hard to master, and the combinations are infinite (okay, they aren't but there are a lot of them).

Herein lies another tale, the legend of IceFrog^[1](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/IceFrog). Although his official name was revealed in court last year^[1](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3726401/BlizzardvLilith.pdf), the conspiracy theories about the identity of the lead developer for DotA2 used to keep pouring in, with Bruno^[1](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Bruno), [a well-known caster](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/98r169/i_met_icefrog_today/), [often](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2hbj36/statsman_brunoicefrog/) [said to](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2gnboo/is_bruno_icefrog/) [be](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5ctoc3/come_back_to_us_bruno/) [IceFrog](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/35zr2z/bruno_is_icefrog_meme_timeline_of_undisputed/), and other fluff pieces [calling](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/55pqua/is_siractionslacks_icefrog_an_indepth_analysis/) SirActionSlacks^[1](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/SirActionSlacks), another community member, the [frozen toad](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5fvdgh/have_you_heard_about_our_lord_and_saviour_icefrog/). [We do love IceFrog though](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/yk94x/the_diablo_3_dev_controversy_made_me_realize_how/).

Now, let's go through the annals of DotA 2 through the eyes of r/DotA2.

**2011**:

DotA 2 was first announced at GameCom, Cologne in 2011, with the first International being held having a prize pool of US$1 million^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2#Release). 16 teams were invited to compete in the tournament, which would also serve as the first public viewing of Dota 2, and it was streamed online with commentary in four languages. Na'Vi^[1](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Natus_Vincere) [won](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/jplb4/1000000_championship_finals_discussion/) the tournament, and would go on to become one of the biggest teams in the game. The finals^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrEaaRLF-H4&t=263s), cast by TobiWan^[1](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/TobiWan) and syndereN^[1](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/SyndereN) are a delight to watch even 8 years later. A documentary named ""Free To Play^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjZYMI1zB9s)"" was made about 'The International'^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_to_Play_(film)/).

[Patch Notes for 2011 - v6.70 to v6.72d](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Patches/2011) 

**2012**:

This year's 'The International 2012' [moved to Seattle](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/th6yh/dota_2_the_international_venue_announced/), with the prize pool still at US$1.6 million, and the teams playing live on a stage in front of about 2,500 spectators^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)#2012). TI2's most memorable moments include [THE PLAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDaJes0T1Ig), the OG [IT'S A DISAASTAAAH](https://youtu.be/ZJJ4PZ3eoVo?t=29), Bruno's [no legs strat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3GnjlCVT9Q&feature=player_embedded), where you could see everyone else die a little inside and [LD](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/xeagq/anyone_else_have_love_for_ld_dota/)'s^[1](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/LD) over-exaggerated(is it though?)

The DreamHack Winter 2012 finals gave us [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAWK5kNDDlM) of the most insane plays and hype-casting moments, the jD Masters Semifinals gave us the Maelk Award^[1](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Maelk#Trivia), and an online stream gave us this [epic Ravage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUucnZiBxAE) by Sheever^[1](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Sheever).

[Diretide](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/12dlp5/halloween_event_diretide/)^[1](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Diretide), was introduced for the first time, and became one of Dota 2's favorite time-limited event.

**2013**:

2013 was the year [Ranked Matchmaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1sahef/ranked_matchmaking_incoming/) was introduced, and Skeleton King got *[removed due to pressing ceremonial reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1sl60x/skeleton_king_removed_from_dota_2_we_get_the/)* ^[1](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Wraith_King#Trivia).

The International 2013^[1](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_International_2013) (can we.. like..call it TI**3**?) was once again held in Seattle and an ""[Interactive Compendium](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1du8l7/introducing_the_interactive_compendium/)"" was announced, with 25% of its sales amount going towards funding the prize pool. The US$1.6 million allocated by Valve, plus the compendium sales helped raise the prize pool to US$2.8 million. Team Alliance^[1](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Alliance) [won the tournament](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1k6q92/congratulations_to_the_winner_of_the/), beating Na`Vi 3-2 in the grand finals^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08SlUCv6Mpg). This event was hosted by Kaci Aitchison, who would go on to be a part of the next TI's as well.

Some of the most memorable moments and posts of the year were [Na`Vi's fountain hooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1k2l3c/collection_of_posts_regarding_fountain_hooking_in/), [the battle between r/LeagueOfLegends and r/Dota2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1becna/declaration_of_war_against_the_imperial_kingdom/), aforementioned Kaci's [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1ke3xc/hi_its_kaci_from_ti3_ama/), [kYxY's aegis denial](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1k64t0/kyxy_from_vg/)^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQPn8eHmOmg), the million dollar dream coil^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQx3Op4_oY), another insane piece of hypecasting^[1](https://youtu.be/0hAXEoXCEi4?t=114), [renaming of some heroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1r0yys/windrunner_and_necrolyte_may_be_renamed/) and discussions about a [river](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/18tc9l/the_rivers_name/c8hs9kr).

But, the highlight of the year was when the community wanted Diretide, got hints that [it wasn't coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1ppo33/something_is_fishy/), invaded r/Volvo and sent them to r/all, [while requesting Diretide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Volvo/comments/1pp74t/wtf_volvo_why_no_diretide/), and then [thanking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Volvo/comments/1q7og8/based_volvo/) [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Volvo/comments/1q7ox9/thanks_volvo_we_got_diretide/), because they got both, [a response from Valve](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1q7vpi/new_diretide_upcoming_big_update_patch/), and also the [Diretide game mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1qn8n6/dota_2_update_three_spirits_diretide_is_now_live/)

Welcome to /r/retrogames, a community for discussion about vintage games. 

We're the discussion-only sister-subreddit to /r/retrogaming. 

/r/retrogames is to /r/retrogaming as /r/games is to /r/gaming. 

Come check us out and ask the community anything vintage gaming related. Talk to the community about your vintage gaming experience! 

># What is vintage?

>>We needed a cut off, so we went with N64. N64 and earlier are vintage for /r/retrogames. 

># Are there any other good retro gaming discussion subreddits?

>>A lot of good discussion happens on all kinds of subreddits. We're just one that's discussion-only. 

>>That said... If you really want to get deep about a console or a game, try find the console-specific subreddit. For example, if I wanted to talk about  Ocarina of Time I might go to /r/N64. If I wanted to talk about A Link to the Past, I'd check out /r/SNES.  

># Why a discussion-only subreddit for retro games?

>>While /r/retrogaming also allows discussion, at the same time it allows for collection posts, scores, battlestations, and other media types of posts that can push down good old discussion threads. It's /r/TheoryOfReddit stuff. In mixed media communities self-posts often fail to rise.",1566565249.0,2019-08-23 15:00:49

/r/ShitPostCrusaders is a subreddit focused on JoJo, a manga created by the everlasting Hirohiko Araki. Compared to all other subreddits we showed this week, this one is actually just for memes. Because JoJo provides some amazing meme material.
For those who don’t know, JoJo follows the Joestar family through 8 parts. Each part changes the series drastically – From a noble gentlemen that doesn’t want to fight anyone and lives on the code of honor to some gay priest that loved his time with some vampire and now wants to ??? the world. (Part 6 spoilers are still spoilers). 
So yeah, if you like JoJo or like memes, visit that subreddit daily!

/r/OnePunchMan is a subreddit focused on One Punch Man, a webcomic created by ONE which became one of the biggest hits in anime culture.
> Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored. This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.

/r/SteinsGate is about well, Steins;Gate.
Steins;Gate is an adaptation of the video game of the same name. It is set in 2010 in Akihabara, Tokyo, and follows Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"", who runs the ""Future Gadget Laboratory"" in an apartment together with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru ""Daru"" Hashida.
It’s an anime focused on time travel and the aftereffects of it and is extremely thrilling.
The subreddit offers you a great way to discuss the anime/game and share your fan creations.

/r/MobPsycho100 is a subreddit dedicated to Mob Psycho 100, an anime and manga created by ONE. It follows Shigeo Kageyama, an average middle school boy who lacks most emotions. But there is one difference, he is the most poweful esper in the entire world. To control this power, he always tries to keep his emotions to a minimum but sometimes they go wild and he loses control. Shigeo works for Reigen, THE GREATEST ESPER THAT EVER LIVED!, oh wait no, some con-man and self-proclaimed psychic. 
It’s by far one of my most favorite stories and you can see that I’m not the only one when looking at /r/MobPsycho100. It’s filled with likeminded people that want to discuss the manga/anime or share their awesome fan content.

The way Reddit shares science is in a weird state. 

The default science-themed subreddit is really geared towards science professionals – posts must be about peer reviewed research, and comments are heavily moderated. It is a cool idea, but really, it is more appropriate for a niche audience.

The second-largest general interest science subreddit is supposedly a more relaxed place to discuss and share science. But, unfortunately, the sub seems to have drifted from that mission: the sub is dominated by political postings (17 of the 25 top posts from the past year are about politics) and the mods still put strong limits on what type of content can be shared (no images, no videos etc.).

That’s where r/sciences comes in. A few of us were dissatisfied with the state of affairs for science on Reddit and decided to create a space that has the potential to be a more exciting, more engaging place to share and discuss cool science. And so far, I think it is working! We started the sub last year, and have grown to over 82,000 subscribers.

Here are some of my favorite posts from the past year:

- [Samsung AI lab develops tech that can animate highly realistic heads using only a few -or in some cases - only one starter image.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/bs1tmx/samsung_ai_lab_develops_tech_that_can_animate/)

- [This heart would have been rejected at most transplant centers, donor: 75 min down time, CPR, LVH. Using warm perfusion technology, however, Duke researchers were able to successfully transplant the heart to a new recipient.] 
(https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/cm9yiz/this_heart_would_have_been_rejected_at_most/)

- [Genetically modified T-cells hunting down and killing cancer cells](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/aogzvt/genetically_modified_tcells_hunting_down_and/)

None of these posts would have been allowed at either of the other major science-themed subreddits I mentioned above. So I am glad we’ve created a space, r/sciences, to share this type of cool content.

___

When it comes to moderating, we are guided by one principle, “*Just science on reddit, without the drama*”. We just ask that the posts be science-related, and that the comments demonstrate a respect for our fellow Redditors. Beyond that, we mostly let the voting system sort things out. Most of the mod activity is geared towards removing spam and breaking up the occasional fight or deleting the occasional comments from wacko-conspiracy theorist trolls.

If r/sciences sounds interesting to you, feel free to check us out and subscribe!

/r/MakeupLounge is a chill escape for all lovers of makeup. It has a Fred Rogers theme to promote the positive and open-minded environment that the great Mr. Rogers would endorse. The creator of the subreddit, /u/BotoxBarbie, created it as a haven away from the glorified booby pics and overly filtered selfies of other makeup centric communities and platforms (Instagram anyone?). Although this was her very first subreddit, she has taken all the chaos that comes with a new community in stride and runs it with an iron fist of benevolence.

Alongside the *illustrious* /u/BotoxBarbie is a mod team that is thoroughly vetted by a community representative program, where potential mods are elected to hear concerns and ideas from the /r/MakeupLounge community and engage with current mods while also learning the responsibilities that come with being a noble mod. This is not unlike our very own intern program here at our glorious subreddit! The mods are overall active and passionately involved in /r/MakeupLounge and strive to maintain a friendly and wholesome atmosphere. Make sure to keep all constructive criticism constructive! There are no nasties allowed or else you'll get a strike from the queens themselves!

**30,674** readers for **8 years!** 

r/DragonQuest is dedicated to the Dragon Quest JRPG series (Japanese role-playing game) created by Yuji Horii and his studio Armor Project. The series is published by Square-Enix. The first Dragon Quest game (1986) for the Famicom is widely considered to be a pioneer of the JRPG genre and inspired the development of other series such as Final Fantasy. Until the release of Dragon Quest VIII for the PS2, the series was known as Dragon Warrior in North America.

In each main-line Dragon Quest game, you play a hero who sets out on an adventure to save the world from a powerful evil. Aside from the first game, you are accompanied by several party members who possess their own sets of skills/classes to help you along your way. The games consist of turn-based combat, and monster encounters had been traditionally random until recent releases began showing them on the map.

Dragon Quest consists of eleven main-line games, as well as many spinoffs. In Japan, there has been much Dragon Quest media released, such as manga, anime and novels. The movie ""Dragon Quest: Your Story"" also released in Japan on August 2, 2019. The series has seen recent releases outside of Japan, with the main-line game Dragon Quest XI for PS4 and Steam, released September 4, 2018. An enhanced version, Dragon Quest XI S, is set for release worldwide on the Nintendo Switch, September 27, 2019. The spinoff Dragon Quest Builders 2 was also recently released outside of Japan on July 12, 2019.

r/DragonQuest is dedicated to all things Dragon Quest. We are a very welcoming community, and are a great resource for both long time fans of the series, as well as those who wish to jump into the series for the first time.

The Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 800 million albums worldwide. They are the best-selling music artists in the US, with certified sales of over 178 million units, and have had more number-one albums on the British charts, and have sold more singles in the UK, than any other act. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboardmagazine's list of the all-time most successful artists; as of 2019, the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. The band have received seven Grammy Awards.

Okay so I just found this subreddit in a comment section around Reddit and I thought it deserved to get featured.

Now what is an ""unexpected factorial"", you may ask? Well, an unexpected factorial is any moment where someone gets too excited and drops an exclamation point after a number. For all you math peeps, you probably know that factorial is a mathematical operator that is basically equal to `f(n) = 1*2*3*4*...*n`. If you still don't know what I mean, here's [a quick Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+factorial). Often times the factorial operator ""accidentally"" makes its way into our everyday lives or into popular culture.

That's where /r/unexpectedfactorial comes in. On the subreddit you can find some fine examples of people accidentally placing exclamation marks after numbers. Here's an example of [a nice one](https://redd.it/ck4vmi). You'll never go bored by switching to /top and just searching through all day. 

Popular content: people getting too excited with their numbers, the fact that `0! == 1`, people who don't know what the factorial operator is and encounter another person who does.

A few neat posts from /top:

Out of ten, I give this subreddit a **10!** ^haha, ^get ^it?

/r/ItRunsDoom is an expression indicating that a device is capable of running the 1993 first-person shooter video game Doom, which has been successfully ported to a variety of electronic gadgets designed for purposes other than gaming.

On December 10th, 1993, Doom was released by id Software for MS-DOS personal computers. In 1997, the company released the game's source code, allowing enthusiasts to port the game to a variety of devices. 


 This subreddit looks to find the most unusual systems that can run doom, from running it in cars, to running it on a ticket scanner.  







ItRunsDoom also has a [Tumblr] (https://itrunsdoom.tumblr.com) page, and a [know your meme page] (https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/it-runs-doom), this goes to show how popular the community is.

**57,571** readers for **3 years**!


We've all seen it. A car filled to the brim with trash. Some call it car hoarding. We call it, Carbage!

r/carbage was started 3 years ago as sort of a gag. A user on r/WTF posted a picture of a car filled with trash. Someone said there should be a sub for cars like this. So, this sub was created on a whim. There were similar subreddits for cars similar to this, but the name, ""carbage,"" was catchy and really took off.

Today, there are nearly 60,000 subscribers and the subreddit continues to grow steadily.

/r/LegoGameMemes provides you with some of the best memes from the Lego games universe. 



Some of these memes on /r/LegoGameMemes include classic games from the early to late 2000s, such as Lego Star Wars: The Video Game Lego, Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, and Lego Batman: The Videogame. Since a lot of people on reddit grew up playing the above games it's very relatable.

Electric Light Orchestra is a band formed in 1970 by Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood. Back then, it was something unique. Today, it's still something really unique. I found ELO a few years ago and have been fascinated by their works ever since. Obviously everyone knows [Mr Blue Sky] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQUlA8Hcv4s), it's their most popular song by a mile. Several miles, actually. But the brilliancy doesn't stop there with them. 

I always liked electronic music, it was one of the first genres I got into. Mainly through Newgrounds artists like [EnV] (https://envy.newgrounds.com/), [TheFatRat] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa_UMppcMsHIzb5LDx1u9zQ), [Dimrain47] (https://dimrain47.newgrounds.com/), and other brilliant artists. But I've also always had a love for the orchestral stuff too, classical music, stuff like [Rachmaninoff] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9QLiefnoDE), [Liszt] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsxDH4HcOWA), [Chopin] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ83Lwnhkj0), maybe a bit of Bach on the weekends, the normal stuff. It was through these 2 avenues that I found ELO. The beautiful cross between the 2 genres. You have [electronic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJQyGbv0oZ8), you have orchestral, you have [electric orchestral] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGLI_mnryWc), you have [untapped meme potential] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNUbBpZ9Ac0), you have [music perfection] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H75ivqdjgCg), and so much more. I can't link all the amazing songs they've made, so I'll just link to [Time] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WMO4zWuAIM) because it's the best album and nobody can convince me otherwise (skip the prologue if you're weak willed, it ends at 1:16).

So yeah, ELO is an excellent band, to understate it a little. However, this is r/SubredditOfTheDay, not r/randomreddituserrantsabouttheirfavouriteband, so let's talk about /r/ELO a bit, shall we?

If you haven't yet worked it out, /r/ELO is the hub for all ELO related discussion on Reddit. Whether it be talking about recent tours, concerts, discussing certain songs, or just posting memes or whatever, /r/ELO is the place to go for it.


&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/Jhrotrod** I discovered this sub from a spontaneous search, wondering if there was a subreddit for my new favorite band. Sure enough, there was, and I soon started to frequent the sub and post some content myself. However, I noticed that the subreddit didn't have a whole lot of flair on New Reddit, so I PM'ed the mods with some suggestions and they promoted me and just let me handle it myself.

>> **/u/fieldsocern** I'm a huge fan and wanted to get more involved in the sub. I messaged the mods one day and asked if they need help and I got invited to mod.

>> **/u/Tekuzo** I was on /r/rush one day (I forget exactly when) and I was wondering if there was an ELO dedicated subreddit. I saw that there wasn't so I created /r/elo.




> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/Jhrotrod** Easy, really. No one in this community explicitly violates the rules with terrible content, so as a moderator you can focus on improving the subreddit rather than cracking down on spam (which there have been rare cases of). It's really fun! I love being involved with the community as a mod.

>> **/u/fieldsocern** Pretty easy, not much happens.

>> **/u/Tekuzo** This subreddit is really easy to moderate. I don't do a whole lot, the other mods are a lot more active than I am. We have a really great community and instances of spam or abuse are incredibly rare.






> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/u/Jhrotrod** I have plenty of favorites here for sure. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/elo/comments/9yzvjk/the_stages_of_discovering_electric_light_orchestra/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is a great meme and top post of this sub for a reason. [This pic](https://www.reddit.com/r/elo/comments/82nrks/jeff_being_jeff/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) was my Discord profile picture for a long time, and is just generally hilarious because it looks so much like Jeff Lynne. And of course [this great virgin vs. Chad meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/elo/comments/9xae8i/i_thought_u_legends_might_appreciate_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). More of my favorites [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/elo/comments/b09htc/i_replaced_mr_blue_sky_in_guardians_of_the_galaxy/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/elo/comments/c0r3ol/boy_blue_be_like/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/elo/comments/ak70t7/amazing_graphic_i_found/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).  

>> **/u/fieldsocern** I've been enjoying the album survivor contests, enjoy seeing what people like and don't like from different albums.

>> **/u/Tekuzo** Somebody made a chiptune version of Mr Blue Sky but I can't seem to find it for the life of me. I have a soft spot for chip tunes and seeing somebody put in the work to make a chip tune version of an ELO song is really cool.

^(*Author's note: I looked through the sub for the aforementioned chiptune MR Blue Sky cover with no luck.*)  [^*Here's*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAHb211gBXw)  ^(*one I found on youtube though.*)




> **4: What's your favourite ELO song/album? Why?**

>> **/u/Jhrotrod** This is an absolutely horrible thing to ask me because I love every album of this band (except for No Answer, it's earrape and everyone knows it). My favorite is probably Out of the Blue, and next two being A New World Record and Time. Favorite song is Turn to Stone, absolute BANGER.

>> **/u/fieldsocern** Song: Telephone Line. Album: Out of the Blue hands down.

>> **/u/Tekuzo** I like Do Ya, whenever I hear that song I will stop whatever it is I am doing just to listen to it and appreciate it.





> **5: What are some other groups or albums that you'd recommend ELO fans to listen to?**

>> **/u/Jhrotrod** A very good question, and one worth asking because I've found a lot of great music through ELO. Jeff Lynne's solo album Armchair Theater is very similar and is absolutely awesome. Hall & Oates, George Harrison's solo work, Cheap Trick, and of course Traveling Wilburys are all worth a listen if you enjoy ELO as well.

>> **/u/fieldsocern** The Beatles, Queen, Travelling Wilburys, George Harrison, Tom Petty, Dhani Harrison, little known group called Globus.

>> **/u/Tekuzo** I would have to recommend Rush because I created this subreddit after visiting /r/rush





> **6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/Jhrotrod** Personally, I'm not a very creative person, so I think it would be good to open up a thread to ask about what the community would like from the subreddit. The other mods probably have some ideas too!

>> **/u/fieldsocern** Maybe try and grow the sub more. Maybe implement daily song discussions and weekly album discussions.

>> **/u/Tekuzo** I am planning on just staying the course. Our community keeps growing and more great people keep coming.





> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/Jhrotrod** I just wanna say again that I'm so proud of this community - but unironically. The subreddit has seen massive growth recently and it's so great to see all the new content being produced. Thank you to everyone for making r/ELO such an awesome place!

>> **/u/fieldsocern** Everyone's welcome to join and everyone should go see ELO on their current tour.

>> **/u/Tekuzo** Just that I am happy to be a part of this community and anybody is welcome to come and be a part of it.

/r/footballmanagergames is one of the largest Football Manager communities on the internet. It has funny/relatable memes, impassioned stories, and screenshots of amazing occurrences in peoples' saves. We are very lentient when it comes to submission rules, so if it is about Football Manager or Championship Manager then it is welcome on the subreddit. 

In the past we've had some great experiments done, such as *[What If... The league winners had to release their squad](https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/6asfxh/experiment_what_if_the_league_winners_had_to/)*. We've also had some hilarious and relatable memes such as *[""Peak FM""](https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/bnndr7/peak_fm/)*. All types of posts and discussions are encouraged.

There is also a subreddit leaderboard that is unique on Reddit wherein users can earn points depending on how many upvotes their submissions get. You are then awarded an upgraded badge (displayed in your flair) depending on your total points. More about that can be found in the ""subreddit leaderboard"" link in our sidebar. 

We also do semi-frequent AMAs from people in the community such as YouTubers DoctorBenjy and LokiDoki.

**1,092** readers for **1 month!**


Wholesome Mental Health Memes is just about like it sounds. The goal was to break the stigma of mental illnesses and disorders, educate on what these hundreds of illnesses are truly like, and create a safe place to share your jokes that keep things uplifting and trigger-free.

WMHM is a mashup of Wholesome Memes and various mental health memes that aren't very widespread or active. The thing about Wholesome Memes is that they rarely focus on mental health, and the issue with the subs that do is that they've died down, been abandoned, or focus on specific illnesses. The idea here is to get people talking about  therapy, medications, and real world issues through fun or inspiring posts, and maybe reach out for help. 

This awesome sub had taken off in just the first week with hundreds of subscribers on the daily, reaching 1,000 in just a month. The owner of this subreddit (myself) is brand new to moderating, and only about a year and a half on reddit in general so knowing how to keep things moving is getting difficult. I know that if this sub got more traction, it would be even more active than it already is.

The most upvoted posts come from [OC](https://www.reddit.com/r/WMHM/comments/c5hpmj/goodbye_peer_pressure/), and [Tumblr](https://www.reddit.com/r/WMHM/comments/c7g8ja/stay_healthy_yo/), but getting [discussion based posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WMHM/comments/c9ddqh/pass_it_on_someone_needs_this_today/) out there pays off pretty well, too.

At r/SubredditOfTheDay, we are constantly on the lookout for new talent. We take in many writers each year, some pass the trials, and prove themselves worthy of the prestigious title ""writer"". Others, bless their souls of green, are unable to make it, and are left to abide in the mundane of the site: The default subreddits. I shudder at the thought.


And while r/SubredditOfTheDay may not be the largest of subs, or have the best rep, we still strive to provide the best possible content that we can. Oftentimes we succeed, sometimes we fail, and are forced to shit out a half assed feature for a sub that nobody really cares for. Nobody wants that. Nobody wants their favourite subreddit's moment of glory to be a single link with a title straight from their sidebar. We want to resolve this problem, and we can't do it alone. That's why we need your help, to create features and make this sub kick ass! We're hiring interns, baby!






If you were to become an intern, these are what you'd be signing up for:



* You would write articles for Subreddit Of The Day (obviously). We don't restrict writers much on what they want to write for, so you'll be free to write whatever you want (to a point, of course)!


* Once through the intern program, you would be made a full time moderator of r/SubredditOfTheDay! You would have all the powers a regular mod of the sub would have.


* You'd get to be part of the coolest group on the site! 😎*



\* ^(note: coolness may vary depending on how cool *you* are. Though you look pretty damn cool, so we aren't worrying.)



&nbsp;




If you're interested in becoming a moderator of r/subredditoftheday, please [complete the form here] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LWMnuvVh0ItVuwfcpb8cup-kMufKr-qa3oBp-qWQm7w/) and we'll decide in the best applicants in 2-3 weeks!!




## **Requirements for becoming an intern:**



* Being somewhat active on Reddit, at least 2 or 3 times a week.


* Good creative writing skills. You will be writing, of course.

* Willingness to obey our ~~supreme overlord /u/_TomGER with all your strength~~ subreddit's rules on features (don't worry, they're not too restricting past common sense).





## **What does the internship program entail?**



* You'd have to write at least 4 features over a 2 month period, as well as process at least 1 user nominated feature. Additionally, you'll have to make 2 r/tinysubredditoftheday features, which is simply 2 links with titles, no writing required, super easy.

* You'd be given access to our behind the scenes subreddits, which you'd be expected to learn about and use efficiently. Don't worry, they're not too difficult to get the hang of.




## **What does becoming a full member of SROTD entail?**



* You would be expected to remain at least a bit active after the internship program ends. At least one feature every month or two. If you miss this quota one month, you get a warning. If you miss it a second time in the 3 months after that, you are removed as a moderator.


* That's it, really.

So, are you interested? If you like writing and want to help make your favourite subs grow a little more, sign up today!

The sub r/NFRealMusic is a sub dedicated to the artist Nate Feuerstein, better known as NF. NF Makes music that is inspiring, music that has quite literally changed lives. He isn't one of those mumble rappers with no lyrical content or skill, his raps are REAL. His music helps people get through tough times, as some of the stuff he raps about is tough times, such as How Could You Leave Us, where he talks about his mothers death.

Over at the sub we have a wide variety of content, some of which includes discussing his music, hyping each other over new and upcoming releases, fan art, questions relating to his music / merch / him as a person, speculation over his secrecy, and more. Here's some of the great fan art that gets posted: [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfrealmusic/comments/c9amx6/some_fan_art_i_made/), [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfrealmusic/comments/bwtcyu/so_uh_ya_i_did_this_with_watercolors_and_pentel/), and [three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfrealmusic/comments/c4o7t6/since_nate_is_dropping_fire_in_about_a_month/). Of course, this is only a fraction of the amazing fan art that is posted :p


NFs music is how he gets his emotions out. He raps about his passions, struggles, and situations he's dealing with. His lyrics are clean, his bars are fire, and his emotions are REAL. He helps every one of us who listen to him. Real music till the day we die.

**12,135** happy redditors for **7 years**!

Now I know what you're thinking. Haha, featuring /r/cakeday on his cakeday, how original. Well, I did have to put in a microscopic amount of effort for this shitpost. I had to look up the day that I created my account, I had to check across different timezones, and most importantly, I had to write this paragraph. Before you take me to /r/modabuse, here's the actual feature.

/r/cakeday is a year-round celebration of our special day as Redditors. Unlike your real birthday, a cakeday is visible to everybody on Reddit and will often garner you with more internet attention and those sweet, useless karma points. Although it began as simply a counter of the age of one's Reddit account, the cakeday has grown to be so much more. A higher cakeday shows dedication, forbearance, and stubbornness. Right now, there are people on this site with accounts older than the physical age of others on this site, and I think that's something worth celebrating.

So go spread the joy to all those celebrating their special day, and may you be blessed on your own cakeday as well.

**4,136** *readers* for **4 years**

2014 was an interesting year for my personal reddit journey. That was the year I finally made it to r/CenturyClub (for users with over 100k karma) with my first account. That was also the year u/GallowBoob made it to CenturyClub. We both have this hobby. I won't pretend it's cool or it has any significance in the world. We enjoy meaningless internet points in the form of reddit karma. We are karmawhores.

2014 was also the year u/ivanoski-007 created /r/AgainstKarmaWhores and I've enjoyed it the whole time. How could I not? The users there seem to love reddit as much as I do, but they have a different vision for the place and they are very happy to talk about how people like me are the thing keeping reddit from being something better than it is now. I disagree with them, obviously, but I still enjoy the sub and have been subscribed pretty much since day 1. 

Getting to talk to ivanoski was a treat, he is like a mythical creature in our world. The Lich or the angel of death. But really, he's just a normal guy who is sick of people exploiting reddit for personal glory. ""Sometimes, good content from regular uses gets buried by karma whores abusing the system. Reddit´s success isn't dependent on karmawhores"" he says. ""...quality is better than quantity"" 

Ivanoski believes that ""The reward system is fine, but could be fine-tuned more"" and that there must be a balance of both original content and viral content for reddit to be the best it can be. In his view, karmawhores are tipping the balance in favor of viral content from other social media and stamping out the potential for original content created by reddit users for other reddit users.

To be a pest, I asked him which subs he goes to for things like gifs, cats, politics, and funny stuff. He listed some pretty major subs like /r/gifs, /r/cats, and /r/funny, as well as /r/idiotsincars.  I pointed out that none of the subs listed were small subs and asked why he doesn't go to smaller venues to see concerts if he doesn't like Nickelback.

""I like to wade through the trash every now and then to find treasure and good content. I actually love Nickelback""

His perfect version of reddit is ""one that does not have facebook quality crap (i don´t give a shit about your graduation pics)"" 

I remind him I'm a mod of r/pics and we see this complaint a lot. I asked him why the people who love that content should not be allowed to enjoy it just to satisfy the tastes of people like himself. 

""I think you are the only reason I am not perma banned from /r/pics, i thank you for that. Part of it is that I like to make fun of those who like sob stories... I mean .. why. Sure, people have different tastes for entertainment. I like to make fun of that for my own amusement, and thats why i do it at /r/againstkarmawhores because I can do so safely there, sometimes it is a one man show but i don't care... it is my idea of fun on reddit sometimes.""


I actually think it's fun too, ivanoski-007, and I appreciate that you've kept the sub going for so long. Thanks for your time.

Welcome to r/DC_CINEMEMES.
Yes, it is real! So real that you can taste it. It tastes hoppy and nutty, with a slightly fruity aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. This busty sub will be your trusty hub for memes based on the films based on DC properties based on all our deepest hopes and fears. Yes, even Jonah Hex (if you’re that twisted), though I’m sure more of you will settle for the goldmines that are Catwoman and Steel. Both of which are welcome here. Naturally, memes forged in the fires of the DCEU are welcome, from the wholesome four-quadrant family fun of Man of Steel, the German Expressionist uber-genius of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Subtitle, the Oscar-winning Suicide Squad, the genre-defining third act of Wonder Woman, and the totally non-polarizing, financially successful, and subjectively best goldmine Justice League.
BUT WAIT! YOU THOUGHT ME DONE? Wrong as usual! With memes this powerful, one might wonder, who, besides the mods, could possibly watch these watchers of men? Okay, bad setup, good payoff— WATCHMEN memes are accepted here! As are V for Vendetta memes in all their anonymous cringe and glory. So enjoy your stay, because we’ve already locked the gates.
You will love us. You all will. - Super Macho Man Steppenwolf

New Patriotism is the dedication to the positive values, ethics, and principles that rightly inspire pride in the nations that embodies them. It is a place for people who value a devotion to the principles of democracy, and seek to hold their leaders to standards that will make them proud. New Patriotism is about loving Freedom, Courage, Liberty, Compassion, and your fellow citizens. Nationalism means standing behind your country even as it does wrong, Patriotism is about standing behind your country to drive it to do what is right.  
  
/r/NewPatriotism is a subreddit dedicated to sharing stories about the people who embody those values, and writing that illuminates why those values are important, as well as a place for people who are off-put by the right-wing conception of (pseudo) Patriotism - the type of ""Patriotism"" used to promote agendas that are not Patriotic. A go-to examples being the phrase ""Support the Troops"" being used to send troops to die on foreign soil in unjust wars, using vast amounts of resources, while demonizing those who oppose the war as being ""against"" their country's military. And so, /r/NewPatriotism is also here to highlight examples of the Pseudo-Patriotism that exploits the concept of nation pride in order to further unPatriotic ideological agendas.

/r/DeTrashed is a subreddit dedicated to cleaning up the environment one piece of trash at a time. Posts on this sub include anything from picking up a bottle while walking your dog in the morning, cleaning up a campsite, or even organizing a clean-up event. While this sub was initially just for picking up trash and cleaning the environment, it has become so much more - anything can be posted that is taking an active step to improve the earth, like cleaning up trash, recycling, removing invasive species, green improvements on your house, magnet fishing, clearing gutters, etc! Posters are encouraged on the sidebar to ""be creative""!  

The main point of this sub isn't about bragging (although you are allowed to), it is about encouraging others to help out and get involved. Some people may say a few people's actions alone can't do much for the environment, but when there is an entire subreddit and movement dedicated to DeTrashing that encourages others, we can absolutely make a difference!

/r/geosim is one of the largest xpowers subreddits there are, having a niche within a niche by providing both grounding realism and the possibility to forge ones own path in whatever direction they want. Players can prioritise a realistic path based on the modern day or through gradual build-up create a whole new spin on their country (with the amount of effort correlated with the zaniness of the endgoal).  
  
With several simple systems working in tandem, players can [create national budgets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/7h8rzr/budget_mexican_budget_2019/), [negotiate alliances or trade deals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/bfwn03/diplomacy_the_tangier_pact_the_defensive_alliance/), [work with the UN](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/9akzit/un_resolution_2632_of_the_united_nations_general/), [perform assassinations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/asusam/secret_let_the_skyfall/), [wage war](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/b9i872/conflict_off_we_go_into_the_wild_blue_yonder/), and [annex other countries](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/abd0f3/expansion_the_referendum/). With every country pursuing their own interests, the diplomatic dynamic quickly changes in the world, and exploring that dynamic is possibly one of the best parts of the subreddit.  
  
The game isn't just oriented outwardly, though. Domestic posts dominate, with elections, infrastructural plans, political rp, and protests being common. Just generally making the country better is something that can always be done, and so is a common pastime in between the bouts of aggressive soft power pissing contests.

It's basically a satire subreddit where the user either post comments of users on some social network that think using the word potato makes them random or funny or they ironically posts images or memes with potatoes. It's a spin-off off r/iamveryrandom since the potato posts mainly dominate that subreddit and earn a separate one.

/r/SubredditDrama is the one and only place where people can come and talk about reddit fights and other dramatic happenings from other subreddits. Here you will find links to spicy threads highlighting the emotion and stupidity of reddit, normally just people who don't know how to step away from an internet fight flinging shit at each other. One of the main rules is to not vote or comment in linked threads, and simply observe. Instead of diving in face-first and reveling in the shit, SRD is for discussing the drama while consuming tons of popcorn.   
  
My favourite submissions on this subreddit aren't the typical race-driven-feminist-SJW-gender-wars piss-matches, but rather the obscure shit. For example, the time [a user trying to argue his dad (who killed four people over almost 10 years) wasn't a serial killer](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/cb52a7/a_user_tries_to_argue_that_their_dad_wasnt_a/), or [r/pokemon RISING UP™ against Pokemon screwing over its fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ca0vyc/dexit_or_the_pokemon_are_removed_from_pokemon/). While the [/r/The_Donald](https://www.reddit.com) quarantine or the /r/incels bannening threads are an interesting read, I think this subreddit is at its best when it showcases random scraps from weird corners of this site.  
  
If you'd like a place to feel smug about yourself by reading other people's petty arguments, /r/SubredditDrama is the place for you! And maybe one day, [you'll find out that something you've posted has found it's way there](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/cb1d5p/rfragilewhiteredditor_is_chosen_as_the/).

- It was created about a month ago and has more than two thousand subscribers right now. I think people really like the idea.

- There’s a great subreddit r/ChurchofEmma which is almost identical to yours. Why should anyone subscribe to r/EmmaEmmaEmma? 
-That’s a tough question. A few weeks ago I celebrated my cake day and thought that I knew almost every interesting subreddit here on Reddit. Well... Unfortunately I’ve never heard about r/ChurchofEmma (this subreddit is really cool and mods are doing a great job) and I think the problem is that the Reddit’s search engine shows you exactly what you are asking it for. You ask him to show you **Emma**? He’ll show you every subreddit that starts with Emma - r/**Emma**Watson, r/**Emma**Stone and r/**Emma**_Roberts. So it seemed to me that the subreddit dedicated to three Emmas was kinda unique idea and... r/EmmaEmmaEmma was created. More than 1000 subscribers later someone mentioned Church of Emma in comments...

- There’re so many subreddits on Reddit. So... Should we subscribe to both subreddits?
- Yes, absolutely! In my opinion this subreddits supplement each other like Roberts, Watson and Stone do. And I really enjoy the feedback on the idea of combining three amazing subreddits in one: 

“Lol this is cool”  

“Your one stop source of all things emma haha”  

“Subbed”

- That’s really nice. Thank you for participating in this imaginary dialogue!
- Thank you! And welcome to r/EmmaEmmaEmma.

/r/FragileWhiteRedditor is a subreddit for mocking reddit's large, vocal, and hypocritical fragile white population. We are a satirical [TMOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit)-style meta sub where a mocking tone is highly encouraged. Courtesy warning, this is not a safe space (in the proper sense) for those who'd simply rather avoid bigots and not have to argue for their own dignity and right to exist. Many of us sometimes prefer to take the piss out of the pigs. We completely respect your right not to participate.

/r/youngadults at its core is a place for anyone to come together and discuss anything. People are free to come and go whenever talking about a wide range of topics. One thing the sub prides itself on is being respectful. For it to effectively encapsulate a community setting, each person that visits the subreddit must feel welcome. One way we evoke the feeling of a community is the specific demographic the sub targets. Being a being a young adult means your anywhere from 18-28. It’s much easier to connect with people that are in similar age brackets, more often than not there will be overlapping interests or beliefs. On r/youngadultsthere’s a new friend around the corner.

&#x200B;

We've only been actively trying to make something of the sub for about 2 months. Our plan with the subreddit is to keep it growing at a steady rate, giving it more exposure, allowing young adults a sort of haven. The subreddit was created because it felt like there was no real subreddit for people who grew out of r/teenagersbut still wanted the discussion and community aspect. It’s a subreddit for that group, however anyone is welcome. It’s a welcoming place with easy going and humble individuals with their own unique background and stories.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The aim of the subreddit it to be a place where /r/teenagers users who age out of that sub can continue to post in a semi more mature setting. While the sub is best for those in their early teens to late 20's, we welcome anyone and everyone. We also have an active Discord server :)

r/WhereAreTheChildren is a subreddit dedicated to the opposition of inhumane treatment of migrant children at the southern border. We believe that it is sick the way we treat these children.

Although this is a political subreddit, we welcome anyone that is open to reform for a more humane treatment of immigrants. The subreddit can also be used as a way to organize protests.

Ask any Baltimore resident or user of /r/baltimore (which I moderate) what their feelings are on DC and the answer will be the same. We like the free museums and the $40 metro. We can't wait to get lost in a swirling vortex of desperation trying to find our way back to I-95. We appreciate everything you are. 

So it was to my delight when I saw that they had not done a subredditoftheday. Of course I wanted to take this opportunity to ask the experts some things that I have been wondering about their city.






**Ben's Chili Bowl: great restaurant or greatest restaurant?**

/u/Oedipe: Every bit the food equivalent to Dan's Cafe, and a must-see spot I recommend to all large tourists in red hats.

**Is it a DC thing to [still support Bill Cosby?](https://i.imgur.com/Of9E4I7.jpg)**

/u/Oedipe: Not even at Ben's Chili Bowl anymore (re Bill Cosby)

/u/BANARCHY: I'm a transplant from Ohio, we only worship Drew Carey

**He is dead to me without glasses. Is there anything on earth worse than DC on the 4th of July**

/u/brahette: worse than dc on 4th of july: trump wanting tanks rolling the streets on 4th of july

/u/Oedipe: Yes, the 2017 inauguration

**incorrect. The answer is ""walking up the Lincoln Memorial steps in August""**

**Do you find it a little off-putting not knowing if the fireworks are actually another 9/11?**

/u/brahette: someone in my neighborhood started selling ""gunshots or fireworks"" tshirts

/u/Oedipe: I'm more worried they'll turn into another 1812

/u/BANARCHY: the Capitol burned down in 1814, fake mod Oedipe spotted

/u/Oedipe: Was referring to the war not the year!

**Nerds. Hmm, my notes just say ""seek acknowledgement that baltimore is better""**

/u/BANARCHY: Baltimore is just fake Philadelphia

/u/Oedipe: We admit to being a regrettable number 2 in Southern Megalopolis murder rates

**DC: a regrettable number 2**

/u/Oedipe: Please don't share that with the New Yorkers

**Why is nothing good ever on display at the american history museum? I'm not even sure R2-D2 exists.**

/u/brahette: agreed

/u/Oedipe: It's true

/u/brahette: hey we have the dinosaur exhibit now!
oh wait nvm, that's natural history

/u/BANARCHY: haha
that's the answer: ""oh wait, that's natural history""

/u/Oedipe: Hey now 90% of the human history around here is busy not being displayed at the National Museum of the American Indian

**woke**

/u/brahette: but you can pay $50 for a buffalo steak tho

**Why does the city have no gas stations and wtf is up with your shitty road system? Maybe giant roundabouts were the only way people could get off in 1740.**

/u/BANARCHY: I'm more upset that we can't buy beer at gas stations here

**same**

/u/Oedipe: We don't like to encourage Maryland drivers to visit, and when they do we try to max out their insurance rates as vengeance

/u/brahette: i believe the diagonal streets were built only to try to kill people

/u/BANARCHY: who cares how many gas stations we have if we can't get 6-packs there?





**Can we just agree that your mayors are still more embarrassing?**

/u/Oedipe: Nope, it's 2019 now
But we will admit to an inferiority in fake children's book drafting

**How do you really feel about Maryland drivers though?**

/u/BANARCHY: the 4th of July tanks will get sideswiped by a Maryland driver making an illegal left turn
and that will end the parade
calling it now

/u/Oedipe: We are 100% positive this is a true and accurate Maryland driver account https://www.reddit.com/user/marylanddriver

**Do you ever consider DC to be like one big Maryland driver?**

/u/BANARCHY: wow


**Why is the metro $14 when the baltimore one is $3? Oh, these are *gourmet* pools of vomit. Good to know.**

/u/brahette: people in dc only pee on the elevators on metro

/u/Oedipe: We take no responsibility for the actions of Congress or the President

**Have you even once considered driving up to see your old pal susan? Why must I always be the one driving?**

/u/brahette: with a name like susan, she can wait

**pls**

/u/Oedipe: On behalf of all of us, please don't
the MARC works fine

**Have you ever seen a wild Trump**

/u/BANARCHY: actually... yes
I ran into Tiffany Trump the other day

/u/Oedipe: I have only seen wisps of unnatural hair-like substance through the tinted windows of an armored SUV
who?

/u/brahette: the cool one

**""cool""**

/u/Oedipe: ... who?

**What dark secrets lie behind the sterling gates of the crystal city?**

/u/BANARCHY: that's where the real pizzagate is

/u/Oedipe: That's where the Vault is, we don't talk about it

**What are some things in DC that are not tourist traps that might interest a redditor**

/u/brahette: READ THE SIDEBAR

/u/Oedipe: READ THE SIDEBAR

/u/BANARCHY: READ THE SIDEBAR



**Sorry, I should have been more specific, do you know where the cheapest titty bar is**

/u/brahette: dan's cafe

/u/BANARCHY: sidebar, it's by the stadium

**reading is hard**

/u/Oedipe: I hear Camelot is the place to be, but I have no idea. I once accidentally went to a titty bar when I was looking for a place to watch march madness.





**What's up with the shitty china town in dc? Why even bother calling it that? It's a CVS with chinese characters and a big cheesy ""CHINA TOWN"" gate, but that's it. I got off the metro just to see this shit.**

/u/brahette: i call it china block
my favorite photo to take is of the arch with the glowing walgreens in the background

/u/BANARCHY: don't forget the Hooters and FedEx

**Great Wall of Hooters**

/u/Oedipe: Rockville refuses to change their name, and we need an easy reference to tell people which mcdonalds to buy their cheap street drugs at

/u/brahette: BuT tHeRe'S cHiNeSe LeTtErS




**Why is beer so expensive there? You make bmore people drive an hour to pay double for beer. Wtf who does that**

/u/brahette: so the beer is to blame for the maryland drivers

/u/BANARCHY: this makes so much more sense


/u/Oedipe: now I get it

/u/BANARCHY: they get drunk here and are upset at the tab and rage drunk drive home

/u/Oedipe: ... but like, all of them? every day?

**Why does DC get the better musical acts? How is that fair?**


/u/BANARCHY: bc we're better

**pfft. Why don't you move to Baltimore and use the extra $900k you save on your house to buy beer at a normal price?**

/u/Oedipe: If you need me I'll be in the closet with some expensive booze, browsing redfin and sobbing

**Why doesn't anyone ever talk about the murder rate in DC? Why's it always gotta be Baltimore? Are DC murders not glamorous enough?**

/u/Oedipe: There are murders here? I've never been EOTR

**tf is EOTR**

/u/brahette: east of the river

**oh**

/u/brahette: aka scary. if you go there, you instantly die



**Why do they still call it Gaylord? I mean, cmon. You want to tell people about the cool convention you went to and you have to admit you paid $20 to park in the rear of the Gaylord. Doesn't seem right.**

/u/Oedipe: Gaylord is EOTR

**Do you ban people who are EOTR?**

/u/Oedipe: You can't ban the dead. 

**alright, that's all i have unless you want to say anything else**


/u/Oedipe: We're just kidding, we love our EOTR neighbors, but fuck Maryland drivers 

**thanks**

/u/Oedipe: Are we off the record now? 

**yes, got any pot?**

I created gardenwild because I wanted somewhere to share my passion for gardening for wildlife and there didn't seem to be anywhere on reddit to do that at the time. It's a place for anyone, anywhere, who is interested in making their space better for wildlife. I didn't expect as many members as we now have, but it's very encouraging more and more people are joining in and improving things for wildlife. 




r/gardenwild is all about encouraging and valuing wildlife in the garden wherever you are, and whatever space you have.

We can all do something to help the creatures in our area. There's a lot of talk about helping pollinators which is fantastic, but we also welcome and encourage questions and advice about helping and living with all the wildlife on your doorstep.

It's a place to ask for help on making your space more attractive to wildlife, to share critters visiting your garden, share projects you're working on for wildlife, find resources to help you, and so on.

/r/FictionWriting is a newly revamped subreddit where writers of all fiction are welcome. So long as it's not non-fiction and it doesn't break one of the rules, you can come and share your thoughts, ideas, and even your stories.

This is a place where bullying, harassment and trolling are not welcome. It's a place to learn, it's a place to grow, and it's a place to help you become a better writer.

There may be various other places on reddit for writers, but I believe that we, the people of reddit, need a place where fiction writers can gather and discuss all kinds of fiction when it comes to literature. No more being bogged down by historical books, travel guides, religious texts, or biographies. This is about our love of alternate worlds and the stories created within them.

NonMurderMysteries is a subreddit that gives you all the non violent mysteries from around the world.



There's something about mysteries that is so irresistibly magnetic and thrilling. It's basic human nature to want to know what is unknown and mysteries give us a chance to solve puzzles and bring order to a chaotic world.

""In 2012, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises opened in theaters. The film's prologue became a frequently memed scene. From Bane kidnapping Dr. Pavel to then exchanging in a dialogue with a CIA official, everything was fair game for memes on r/moviecirclejerk and r/NolanBatmanMemes.

Four years ago, the meme received its own sub: r/baneposting. The description reads: ""All posts should have at least some semi-relevance to the greatest 5 minutes and 15 seconds in the history of cinema.""

What are some famous memes that came out of the sub? I'll let you see for yourself. Today the r/baneposting has over 5 thousand members, with new memes coming in almost every day. For some reason the meme became popular on 4chan, a place with frequent anti-semitism and bigotry. But they have no right to hijack it. Good people and their baneposts are rising.

So next time you say hello to Dr. Pavel, make sure to tell him you're CIA. And next time someone tries to coerce you by pretending to throw you out of a plane, notice that if that person is using a gun he is probably only pretending. And if someone ever gets captured and put on your flight plan, remember to watch out on the airspace to see that his minions aren't trying to crash your plane as part of their masterplan.

Movies and memes teach us important lessons, and The Dark Knight Rises is no exception.""

Whether Pete is your first choice, top three, or you’re just looking to keep up with 2020 campaigns, you’re more than welcome to join us at r/Pete_Buttigieg!  We try to maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for all (in a recent survey of the sub, 71% mentioned the civility, friendliness, or positivity of the community as the best thing about the sub; 11% thought it was the content; and 18% valued both), regardless of political background or first choice candidates.  We always strive to be like Pete, which is to say [we like having serious policy discussions](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pete_Buttigieg/comments/bzeic3/petes_foreign_policy_speech_postdiscussion_thread/), but [we also like to have some fun every now and then too](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pete_Buttigieg/comments/bz1scr/another_thing_i_like_about_pete_is_his_sense_of/).  But enough about us, here’s a quick rundown on Mayor Pete:  

&nbsp;

* Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg was born in South Bend, Indiana on January 19, 1982  

* Pete is a polyglot, able to speak or understand 7 different languages, who attended Harvard University (2004) and Pembroke College, Oxford (2007) as a Rhodes Scholar  

* He was first elected mayor of South Bend, IN in November 2011, winning 74% of the vote, becoming the youngest mayor of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 residents  

* In 2013, Pete was named [Mayor of the Year](https://govfresh.com/2014/01/2013-govfresh-awards-winners/), and in 2014, *The Washington Post* called him [“the most interesting mayor you’ve never heard of.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/03/10/the-most-interesting-mayor-youve-never-heard-of/)  

* During his first term as mayor, Pete served for seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, returning to the US in 2014.  That same year, he announced that he would seek re-election  

* In 2015, despite [publicly coming out](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/south-bend-mayor-why-coming-out-matters/article_4dce0d12-1415-11e5-83c0-739eebd623ee.html) in a conservative state, Mayor Pete won re-election with over 80% of the vote  

* In 2016, Frank Bruni with the New York Times published a column praising his work and asking if Pete could be [“The First Gay President?”](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/opinion/sunday/the-first-gay-president.html?_r=0)  

* That same year, shortly after the election, President Obama named Pete as a one of the rising [gifted politicians in the Democratic Party](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency) during a conversation about the future of America  

* On April 14, 2019, he officially launched his [Presidential campaign](https://peteforamerica.com/)   

* Mayor Pete currently lives in South Bend, IN (although we hope he has to move soon!) [with his husband Chasten and their two dogs, Buddy and Truman](https://imgur.com/3wvxhli).

**Why is Pete Buttigieg blowing up? He's a mayor of a 42 square miles in northern Indiana with a population of only 102,000 people. That's not the typical resume for a major presidential candidate. So, what gives? You have almost 23,000 subscribers for a candidate that few even know is running.**  

&nbsp;

Mayor Pete has moved into the top tier of democratic primary candidates because he makes an argument not simply for winning an election, but for winning an era. His policy proposals and legislative focus are explicitly oriented towards the long term view, from his focus on democratic reform to his urgency around climate change.  

All of these issues facing America today are explicitly personal to him, and in his day job, they are issues he must face head on with *solutions*, not simply by discussing them in committees. Pete belongs to the generation that came of age with school shootings, the generation that provided the majority of the troops in the conflicts after 9/11, the generation that is on the business end of climate change, and the generation that - unless we take action - stands to be the first to be worse off economically than their parents. As he often mentions on the stump, he expects to live in the America of 2054 -- the America that policy decisions today will set up. [Listen to Mayor Pete make the case for a new generation of leadership.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtAHTlogN-4)  

He has also grounded the early stages of his campaign in an explicit fight for Democratic values, where in the past Democrats have often retreated from hard questions and backed down on key positions for political expediency [(as he pointed out to Ted Kennedy in 2003)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/video/2019/05/18/nation/politics/pete-buttigieg-questions-ted-kennedy-in-2003/). He has [not shied away from hard questions](https://youtu.be/13PAaqNcG-0?t=63) and [refused to cede ground on Democratic priorities](https://youtu.be/9YdNAnDMF_Q?t=1941) by anchoring them in universal principles that Americans treasure -- Freedom, Democracy, and Security. Much of his success has been in using his experience as a Mayor to ground those lofty ideas in the ways that federal policy cashes out in the everyday lives of Americans.   

In a time when Democrats, Independents, and even Republicans are frustrated with the gridlock in Washington and looking for a leader that will get us out of this rut, Pete is a clear and novel voice with a coherent message -- one focused not just on today, but on the future we build as a country for tomorrow.  

&nbsp;

**How important is it that Mr. Buttigieg is openly LGBTQ+?**  

&nbsp;

It is at once both monumentally important and not important at all.  

Mayor Pete’s campaign reprepresents, in part, the progress that LGBTQIA+ activists have long fought for.  Today marks the 50th anniversary (June 28, 1969) of the [Stonewall Riots in New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots). At a time when it was a crime just to be gay and when homosexuality was listed as a sociopathic personality disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association diagnostic manual, LGBTQIA+ activists decided enough was enough and it was time to fight for their rights.  This series of spontaneous demonstrations is often cited as the beginning of the gay civil rights movement in the United States.  Over the next 50 years, the gay civil rights movement experienced many setbacks, but there have been hard fought triumphs and significant progress as well. Last night, just four years after the Supreme Court affirmed his right to marry, [Mayor Pete stepped on the debate stage as the first openly gay person to make a serious bid for the presidency](https://time.com/longform/pete-buttigieg-2020/). The men and women at the Stonewall Inn paved the way to this critical moment, and it represents an affirmation of their hard work and sacrifices.  

Being gay has also given him personal experience in the ways that identity can be used to exclude people from broader American society. Although he does not suggest that the patterns of exclusion are the same, being gay and married to a man has allowed him to empathize with those who are different from him, but who have also been made to feel that they do not belong in America. [He has drawn on this experience to call on Americans of all kinds to stand up for one another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q59_UUReHm8&) -- because as he points out, we are not free until we are all free.   

On the other hand - to paraphrase Mayor Pete - being gay has had no bearing on his job performance in business, in the military, or in his current role as mayor.  It has made him no better or worse at handling a spreadsheet, a rifle, a committee meeting, or a hiring decision.  It doesn’t change how Americans can best judge his effectiveness in serving his city or in judging his potential to usher us into a new American spring.  

&nbsp;

**How does Mr. Buttigieg differentiate himself on policy issues? He's for universal healthcare, is pro-union, strongly for LGBTQ+ rights, and so on. This sounds a lot like what other candidates like Sanders and Warren are offering.**

&nbsp;

Yes it does! Pete is a progressive candidate who supports bold policy solutions like universal healthcare, a 100% clean energy society, the abolition of the electoral college, outlawing gerrymandering, repealing the Hyde amendment, and appointing judges who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade. [Pete’s website has one of the most substantive and detailed Issues pages of any Democratic candidate, and we encourage you to take a look at it.] (https://peteforamerica.com/issues/)  

As more primary voters tune in to the race this summer and fall, Pete will continue rolling out policy plans addressing core, structural problems in our society. One of those proposals is the Douglass Plan for Black America, named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass and as bold as the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. [Pete penned an op-ed in The Charleston Chronicle introducing the Douglass Plan before his participation in the BET Black Economic Alliance Forum.] (https://www.charlestonchronicle.net/2019/06/11/buttigiegs-message-ahead-of-bet-black-economic-alliance-forum/?fbclid=IwAR2Rvqw6eZwgOazw0hnrWOCQSQaSc18H6Ep1XLLBUvdjm_wXDsvSsDYxfaQ)  

But in order to enact and protect these bold progressive policies, Pete believes we must also #ChangeTheChannel on the anti-tax, anti-government, fear-based political narrative that’s consumed American politics since Reagan’s election in 1980. It won’t be enough to eek out a Democratic victory in 2020 and then ram our plans through Congress as quickly as we can once we have power.  

To secure the lasting progressive power we’ll need to combat the climate crisis, root out racial inequities, and fight the global spread of authoritarianism, Pete believes we need to use the 2020 election as an opportunity to #WinTheEra. Pete wants to show voters there’s a different way of doing politics - and a different generation of Democrats ready to lead the way.  

Pete has a plan to build a broad, progressive-led coalition around values shared by all Americans: freedom, security, and democracy. By speaking directly to voters and connecting progressive policies to their own lived experiences and their shared values, Pete can break the ideological spell conservative media and years of disappointment have cast over millions of Americans. At the end of the day, most voters aren’t policy wonks and don’t want to become one. What voters want are elected leaders whose judgement they trust, whose values they share, and who will get the job done. Pete’s record of service shows he can and will do all three as president.  

Mayor Pete believes in a pragmatic, values-driven approach to politics and policies, but he treats the presidency as the three part job that it is -- an executive position running an administration, a policy position changing the course of federal agencies to better the lives of citizens, and a position as a moral leader for the country, unifying people despite the divides in American society. He argues that the Democratic party will converge around about 80% of their opinions and policy, but that he is a different messenger with a different message than the others.  

**We believe Pete can win in 2020 and beyond, and we invite you to check him out yourself to see if that is true.**

**1,389** readers for **1** year!

Is today February 30th?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: Also no, but there is something interesting about this subreddit that must be mentioned. Over a thousand people are subscribed to a subreddit whose sole purpose is to answer a question whose answer should be obvious. (If you failed grade school, February has 29 days at most and therefore there will never be a February 30th.) 

According to all known laws of linear time, there is no way February should be able to reach a length of 30 days. Its duration is too small to buy enough time in the cycle of Earth's revolution around the sun. February 30th, of course, occurs anyways ([at least once in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_non-standard_dates#February_30)) because time doesn't care
what humans think is impossible. Blue, green. Blue, green. Blue, green. Ooh, green and blue! Let's shake it up a little.

Somewhere in the world, there ARE people who hold out hope for a February 30th, in spite of its improbability. (Unless you live in Sweden.) It might be a good thing to join them and let go of all logic and hold out hope that we will get to witness such an amazing event during our lifetimes.

/r/SevenKingdoms is a political medieval roleplaying game based in the best-selling fantasy series by George RR Martin. Forty years have transpired since the roleplay's beginning in 188 A.C, a bloody and violent period of time marked by the revolt of the usurper Daemon Blackfyre. In his wake, internecine conflict has plagued the continent. Marauding ironmen from their desolate isles wash ashore the rich Westerlands for loot and plunder, savage mountain tribes descended from the mountains of the Vale and skirmishes yet and still divide the Reach. 

Matarys Targaryen sits the Iron Throne, and though winter has finally come to wrest Westeros in it's frigid grip, it's schemes, whether they be the avarice of the lowliest Knight or the plots of the recumbent Blackfyres, remain vibrant as ever.

Whether you wish to take up the reins of an entire family, or a lone wanderer, your actions can and will change the entire course of the story - which is not set in stone and flows freely with no destination ready. Whether you prefer the fertile yet lawless grasslands of the Reach to the sands of Dorne, there'll always be a place for you to start your story.

**20,072** subscribers for **2 years!**






/r/LoveIslandTV was set up in 2017 for fans of the UK reality show 'Love Island', where a bunch of attractive single 'islanders' spend a few weeks together in a Mediterranean villa, and they must couple of with each other or risk being 'dumped' from the island. The public are also able to vote on their favourite couples, and those with the fewest votes are dumped. 

The sub took off with season 4 in 2018, and we hosted daily discussion threads where users could post comments and reactions in real-time whilst watching the show. We recruited a number of new mods to help manage the modqueue, and towards the end of the season we had almost 8,000 subscribers from all over the world, and discussion threads were generating over 1,000 comments.

We have only a few simple rules in the sub, and the moderators take a fairly relaxed approach to moderating. The nature of the show means people often disagree and have opposing views, but we encourage active discussions and only remove posts where absolutely necessary. This was the case with a particular subscriber who liked to regularly post about 'red pill theory', but their use of language and attitude, supported by the amount of reports we had to deal with as a result, eventually lead to them being banned. The community loved to hate this user though, and they became a 'legend' of the sub and the focus of many meta memes. 

Season 5 of the show started less than 2 weeks ago, and since then we have almost doubled in size to over 20,000 subscribers. Subscribers regularly comment on how engaging with our community in the daily discussion threads is one of their favourite aspects of the show which they look forward to each day.

/r/selectivemutism, sometimes called Situational Mutism, is a complex situational anxiety disorder characterized by a person's inability to speak and communicate effectively in select social settings (eg. school). These people may be able to communicate in other settings where they are relaxed and secure (eg. with family at home).

Outside of speech, all forms of communication may be inhibited. That includes written language, body language, gesturing, and facial expression. Different people with SM may exhibit different characteristics of the disorder.

While the age of onset is usually very young, many kids can and have become teenagers and adults with SM if not properly treated.

We have a fun [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/F2EbnSv) for all to join and a thoroughly developed [wiki full of resources and information about SM.](https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/wiki/index) 

Despite the seriousness of this disorder affecting approximately 1 in 140 children, there are not enough professionals knowledgeable about its treatment. Awareness goes a long way to helping make the lives of these people easier.

Thank you for reading! If you'd like to learn more, [this youtube video detailing one girl's firsthand experience growing up with SM is a good watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdJDCWVgvQg)

The saxophone is maybe one of, if not the most iconic instrument ever (feel free to fight in the comments about that statement, I feed off of the drama). You ask someone with no musical experience to name a few instruments, they'll probably say guitar, piano, flute and saxophone. Maybe drums too. But sax will probably be there. Even if they don't know its name (which a concerning number of people don't), they'll still know it as the [bent metal jazz doodad
] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Saxophonics/comments/92qh5s/well_at_least_they_didnt_call_it_a_trumpet/) or something. Point is, everyone loves the sax. It's an excellently versatile instrument. It's used in tons of genres, in funk, rock, classical (though very sparsely, it's a fairly new instrument) and most notably, jazz. [Oh, that sweet, sweet jazz] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q). It has an extremely rich and distinctive timbre (fancy music term of saying you blow into it and it makes a funky noise) which is difficult to replicate otherwise in music. Its distinctive sound and volume managed to set it apart from other similar instruments like the clarinet.


/r/Saxophonics is a subreddit for saxophonists to discuss all things saxophone. If you're looking to buy a saxophone, upgrade equipment, need help with maintenance, need new music to play or whatever, r/saxophonics has you covered.

/r/DiePartei is a German party that recently received ~2.1% in the European elections which equates to around 2 seats in the European parliament. Why am I telling you that and why am I even making a feature out of a political party. Well, Die Partei für Arbeit, Rechtsstaat, Tierschutz, Elitenförderung und basisdemokratische Initiative is unique because it actually isn’t a serious party. It’s a party founded by the satirical magazine „Titanic“. They want a wealth maximum of 1 million dollars and a wall. Martin Sonneborn, their god, has been known for many satirical speeches in the European parliament that have went viral and that basically reflects the whole party. And this subreddit is a perfect reflection of the party. Showing some (German) memes relating to the party while just having this funny satirical atmosphere. If you care about German politics, you should probably join.

We say ""all types"" because the people over at other subs don't appreciate outdoor rabbits or rabbits that are not free ranged. Of which most rabbits are NOT despite them being perfectly happy.

People in that sub are willing to tell you how to raise you rabbits and why you're a bad parent despite not having 99% of the information, it becomes toxic.

The people over at r/homestead have a conflicting view on rabbits, some believe they should only be used for meat or wool and others come out of the woodwork to defend the viewpoints of that of the others.

Trying to post an outdoor rabbit to r/homestead is a bit of a toxic thing because it often causes some type of a flame war, either because you are or are not raising utility rabbits.

Thus r/hairybuns was created stemming from the above problems in an attempt to create a more middle-ground for the rabbit lovers out there.

We know that not all rabbits can be free range indoor rabbits, some rabbits are just better off than others.

But a cold-hard fact is that people who have rabbits for a pet, love their pet still!

So with that being said, any posts about pet rabbits, be it indoor or outdoor may be posted here without judgement about care!

**10,097** Betomaniacs *voting* for **9 months!**



Welcome to r/Beto2020! We are a reddit community focused on promoting and creating grassroots involvement and volunteer work for former congressman Beto O’Rourke’s 2020 campaign!

Mr. O’Rourke, or Beto as we affectionately call him, has been a vocal supporter for driving America into an era that listens to its voters regardless of age, gender, generation, party affiliation, income, or race. He is a candidate who will challenge the impending danger of climate change with a 5 trillion dollar plan, change criminal justice by legalizing marijuana and ending unfair systems such as cash bail and the Hyde amendment, create a health care program that will lead America to a universal health care coverage, and provide universal education for our young children in pre-K and preschool.

The one big outlier Beto has over any other candidate is his experience living in the border town of El Paso. Beto calls for not only legal immigration, but humane and moral immigration. Donald Trump ran his campaign on such an issue and only Beto truly has the experience and empathy to address the immigration question America faces. He proposes creating constant communication channels to Latin American countries, to make sure that immigrants are being safely and properly immigrated, without the threat of having families torn apart and put in cages.

It is true that Beto lost to Ted Cruz by around 2.6 points in the 2018 Texas Senate race, and many people would raise an eyebrow about why he should run. The answer is simple, Beto was able to do the one thing that makes a presidential candidate shine: bring people together. Beto was able to create a political machine in Texas and drive up turnout that the state had never seen before. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all came out to vote for Beto, and he came closer than any other candidate had done in the last 40 to 50 years of the state’s history. We believe that Beto can do it again in other relatively red states, and can finally bring this country together from the divisive nature of the current administration.

It is true that many people say a woman should be President, as the world is changing fast, and that the United States needs to change too. But change takes time. There is no doubt in our minds that the women running for President are incredible, but Beto has the enthusiasm and empathy that voters strive to see. The Presidency is not about gender, but rather about policy and the American voter’s voice.

His youth stands out as an asset. America is a country that strives for youthful minds with new ideas, and Beto provides them in spades. From his climate plan and his plans for criminal justice reform, Beto echoes the often forgotten Generation X and Millennial generation by speaking directly to them, something other candidates struggle with on the campaign trail.

Beto can win over voters by being himself. He wins by listening, something many candidates and elected officials have a hard time doing. The point of the President is to be the ear for the people, and if you only are the ear for the people you like, you do not do your job correctly. Beto is the people’s listener and will accomplish what we want as he takes the time to really learn before doing.

Please join us and help Beto become the next President of the United States! Viva Beto!

/r/Absurdism is a subreddit dedicated to the aggregation and discussion of articles and miscellaneous content regarding absurdist philosophy and tangential topics! Absurdism comes from a section of existentialist philosophy that deals with the battle between finding meaning in your life, versus the lack of meaning in an irrational universe. Absurdists try, or do not try, how to work out living in a meaningless universe, ""meaningfully"". Think authors like, Camus, Kafka, Beckett, Kharms, Vonnegut, or Gogol.  
  
Come check us out, ponder our recommended reading list! We plan on starting weekly discussions on related topics quite soon.

Welcome To /r/Dyscalculia This sub is for discussions on Dyscalculia. Dyscalculia is a learning disability that affects a person’s ability to see, or perform math-related tasks. It is a part of the greater dyslexia umbrella, and It plays a part in dyslexia. However, people with dyscalculia may not exhibit stereotypical dyslexic symptoms. Please remember, learning disabilities are neurological disorders; they can manifest in academic and non-academic ways: Dyscalculia may cause someone to forget a number, or formula that was recently mastered.

A man in his 20s runs into his home. He’s horrified as to what **He** has become, and is considering how his insanity will be examined. Will he be locked up? Does anyone believe him? Does it all matter? It doesn’t, as an orange patch of fur falls in front of him. The man, now audibly sobbing, hears one last thing before he is swallowed whole by **Him**: “Jon, I needed lasagna.”

Does this sound insane yet appealing to you? Well, that’s /r/imsorryjon’s style of content. The subreddit mixes the classic cartoon from Jim Davis with cosmic horror, twisting the cat into horrifying images. Whether it be [real-life altars](https://www.reddit.com/r/imsorryjon/comments/byl4xi/youre_unraveling_jon/), [drawings of nightmares](https://www.reddit.com/r/imsorryjon/comments/byzahe/i_can_taste_your_nightmares_jon/), or [computer visions](https://www.reddit.com/r/imsorryjon/comments/bypleb/am_i_just_food_to_you_jon/), the only constant is the massive warping on Jim Davis’s view. During the weekend, they also allow other character’s distortions, such as [Thomas the NOPE engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/imsorryjon/comments/bys2y0/im_sorry_controller/) or [Calvin and Hobbes patching things up](https://www.reddit.com/r/imsorryjon/comments/byjfnq/patched_hobbes_the_perpetual/). The amazing thing with all of these pieces of work are a majority of the work submitted and are completely OC, meaning you'll find new content to worship **Him** with daily. 

Whether you come by to get a new perspective on horror, want a new cult to join, or inspire a new style of drawings for you, it’s a simple matter of time until **He** finds you. Be proactive, and begin your worship of **Him**.

**44,380** *trainers spamming Swords Dance* for **7 years**!

&nbsp;

^(No seriously, Fire Blast has 85% accuracy how in the flying fuck did it miss that goddamned Ferroseed 4 times in a row it's fucking bullsh-)

*cough*

We've all played Pokemon before at least once. It's a massive franchise (that's a fucking understatement) that has been going for over 24 years. In terms of the effect it's had on a generation, it's probably only second to Super Mario, if even.

Although we've all played it before, most of us have only done so through a casual playthrough, where you catch 6 pokemon, get them to decent levels and teach them all strong attacking moves. There is *so much more* that can be done with 812 Pokemon, 728 moves, and countless held items. In a casual playthrough, an overlevelled legendary with earthquake is pretty much all you need to obliterate everything (along with a fuckload of full restores, of course). But with a well made team you can get a lot more destructive. This is what the community over at /r/Stunfisk work to achieve.

This sub is the place for all things related to the competitive Pokémon scene. It's filled with all sorts of content, guides, team building, the latest news on tournaments, interesting strategies, and more!


With the new Pokémon Sword and Shield games announced recently, there's a lot of excitement over what the new content will bring to the competitive scene, whether it be new moves, new Pokémon, or even entirely new mechanics! Whatever will happen, it'll be an interesting and fun experience for all in the meta! If you've only ever played Pokémon casually but are a big fan of he series, I'd highly recommend trying checking out this sub!


&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> I started the subreddit in 2011 because I wanted to create a safe, non-toxic, and inclusive community for people to talk about the competitive Pokémon scene and grow as individuals. - **/u/DudeWynaut**

>> Although I had taken interest in the competitive scene since Generation 5, I started lurking on r/Stunfisk since the beginning of X&Y. Gen 6 had a lot of tools available for getting into serious battling that previous games lacked, and as I had been using /r/friendsafari an awful lot I figured asking for help on a competitive subreddit wouldn't hurt. My first few posts actually were a collection of hypothetical, “theorycrafted” Mega Evolutions like Weavile, Haxorus or Unfezant, and I still really like the idea of working around 'what-if' situations for things that we don't know about yet. I then started making some more serious analysis threads here and there, which got the mod team's interest to make me an approved submitter, then I eventually got promoted to joining the team itself after helping cover shifts for some of the other mods who would usually post the weekly megathreads. – **/u/L0RDR0B**

>> I joined the r/stunfisk Discord sometime in 2017, and loved interacting with and helping other people who shared my passion for VGC. From there, I made my way to helping with the sub, though I still focus mainly on the Discord. - **/u/Arcanigon**

> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> Stunfisk is a relatively small sub compared to some of the others out there, so moderating it doesn't feel like a chore, nor is it too demanding. For me specifically, I'm in charge of hosting weekly VGC tournaments on Pokémon Showdown every month to help get additional practice in for people attending live events. We organise the tournaments on our Discord chat, but a good amount of the publicity is also on the sub. It's always nice to see both new and familiar faces duking it out every Saturday. – **/u/L0RDR0B**

>> Moderating isn’t always easy, but we do our absolute best to make sure the users feel like they’re human by respecting and communicating with them on a down-to-earth level. Activity peaks about every three years when a new generation comes out. We anticipate that this year will be the biggest one to date because Sword and Shield are coming out for the Nintendo Switch. - **/u/DudeWynaut**

> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> I've always been a fan on the AMA sessions, personally. It's one of the rare times where everyone on the subreddit comes together for a common cause, and usually are most popular threads. We've had the likes of Serebii's own [Joe Merrick]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/5mmp5m/serebii_confirmed_ama_with_joe_merrick_creator_of/), [Worlds 2016 Champ Wolfe Glick]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/91i3y2/hey_my_name_is_wolfe_glick_2016_pokemon_world/)  and even the original singer of the anime theme, [Jason Paige]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/4xkkjp/jason_paige_the_original_pokemon_theme_singer_on/) in the past. – **/u/L0RDR0B**

>> My favorite posts include the AMAs by [Aaron “Cybertron” Zheng]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/54g9ef/aaron_cybertron_zheng_here_ama/), 3-Time World Champ [“Mega” Ray Rizzo]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/5qoeog/3time_world_champion_ray_rizzo_ama/), and the creator of Pokémon Showdown!, [Zarel]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/2fnfh5/ama_saturday_zarel_creator_of_pok%C3%A9mon_showdown/). - **/u/DudeWynaut**

>> [Broke’s Brave Bird post is my personal favorite]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/2ygu4z/only_the_bravest_of_birds_need_apply_rate_my/). – **Cho**

>> SylveoPlath's [“Karen Was Wrong: Casual Ethics and Competitive Strategy”]( https://new.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/6g5hp8/karen_was_wrong_casual_ethics_and_competitive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) is still my favorite piece on competitive mentality, and I refer to it a lot when talking to other people about using favorites because it's so much better articulated than anything I could say. - **/u/Arcanigon**

> **4: What's your favourite strategy/gimmick to use in a game (any format)? Regardless of how theoretically sound it is.**

>> Sky Drop. A criminally underrated move, in my opinion. Of course, it only really works in Doubles formats like VGC, but with good planning and tactics you can easily pick up a scary threat and effectively remove it from play for a whole turn. It lets you get up a good deal of easy KO situations, especially if you use it on something fast like Tapu Koko or Unburden Hawlucha who will almost always move first in battle, giving breathing room for slower allies to better position themselves on the field. – **/u/L0RDR0B**

>> I’m a big fan of Blastoise getting Shell Smash one day. I firmly believe that it would make him a more viable Pokémon in higher tiers, and after some testing on Showdown, he is definitely not worse without it. My fingers are crossed that he’ll finally learn it in Gen 8! - **/u/DudeWynaut**

>> My favorite strategy in VGC17 was the hard Eevee team. Changing the team to account for the current meta was really cool. For more gimmicky stuff, Geomancy Smeargle was pretty cool. Anything set up heavily, such as transform Smeargle + Kangaskhan, the aforementioned Eevee, Anger Point Krookodile + Z-Tailwind Extreme Speed Togekiss with Super Luck, etc. are always amusing and force you to build around current threats. - **Cho**

> **5: What are your tips for anyone wishing to get involved in the competitive scene?**

>> As cliché as it sounds, getting in as much practice as possible really does pay dividends (a phrase I have never heard used as much as it is in official VGC streams) in the long run. Showdown! is a great place to start, because you can create, try out and edit teams on the fly - there's nothing worse than spending hours making your team on cartridge only to find you need to make one small change that requires starting all over again. That said, joining local/online tournaments (like the weekly ones we host) or attending live events in your area once you've built up enough confidence will always be a better learning experience than just grinding on the ladder. Real-life events are always a good way to find out any chinks in your armour and how to patch them up. – **/u/L0RDR0B**

>> Learn about stats, EVs, and IVs. Know that speed is the most important stat because it determines who goes first and deals damage first in any given battle. Learn the type-chart. Learn about the most important items, such as Life Orb, Choice Band, Choice Scarf, Leftovers, the Z-Crystals, the mega stones, and the “pinch” berries. Study the abilities that your Pokémon have, which have the best synergy, and how to establish your “win-con”. A big part of competitive play is learning how to make your own team, testing it, and improving it while becoming self-reliant. Research good players on youtube and study how they make their plays from turn to turn. Be chill. Take frequent breaks. Make friends. Make connections. Be good and honest to people. Learn how to lose with grace and win with humility. Try to take something out of it. - **/u/DudeWynaut**

> **6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> We plan to host some buy-in tournaments in the future that will help the best players earn enough money to send themselves to official events around the world. We believe this to be particularly opportunistic for players in Australia and South America because they get fewer opportunities to attend these events than people in North America and the UK. - **/u/DudeWynaut**

> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>> We’re an official Discord Partner! Come join us! discord.gg/Stunfisk - **/u/DudeWynaut**

>> I've been part of Stunfisk for almost four years as of October, from Kalos to Alola, and soon Galar under my belt. I've made a lot of good friends here over the years, and I feel that it serves as an excellent middle-ground between the competitively-focused Smogon and the more casual-friendliness of /r/pokemon. Simply put, it's a great place for both old veterans wanting to catch up on the latest competitive news and newcomers who are just starting to learn the ropes. Anyone wanting to dip their toes into the world of competitive Pokémon should definitely come over to visit. – **/u/L0RDR0B**

/r/beyondpockets is dedicated to the final fashion frontier: the man purse (more/less). But as the sub takes you deeper into the bag-abyss, you'll find that the people in our community are connected by a single purpose: we all want to find the perfect bag, because bulky pockets kinda suck...and sometimes you really don't want to scuttle around in a bulky backpack.

In our sub we explore the depth and variety of modern carry-pieces, from the absurdly unconventional to the shut-up-and-take-my-money. Come for bags, stay for the delightfully satisfying packing GIFs!


So if you find yourself inexplicably drawn to pouches, purses, sacks, slings, briefcases, and the sensuous satisfaction of well-organized packing cubes, then we would love to see you contributing at /r/beyondpockets...because bulgy pockets really do suck.

One of our central aims is to create an environment for promoting the understanding and acceptance of people with psychological differences, while acknowledging the unique and often serious problems these people may face. In particular, this should be a safe space for those who are not neurotypical to talk freely without fear of prejudice, and abuse or hate speech directed at non-NTs will be deleted. Other kinds of prejudice (e.g. on the basis of sex, sexuality, gender, race, or ability) will also result in comments being removed.

**5,391** *Statues* for **1 Month!**
 
 
It all started with a [cryptic letter](https://i.imgur.com/k1aYwbU.jpg) being delivered to many houses in Philadelphia last month, warning residents that all of the food we've eaten since first grade is still alive in our bodies, and that the only way to save ourselves is to melt our bodies with steel and become statues (or to seal yourself in cement, of course). The letter ends with an invitation to attend a logistical meeting at a vacant lot in North Philadelphia on April 27, 2019.  

**Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.**  

The letter became such a running joke on the mother subreddit, r/Philadelphia, that r/FurnaceParty was spun off to contain the [inevitable memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/FurnaceParty/comments/as00o9/it_him/) caused by the surreal absurdity of the manifesto.  

**Breakfast	Lunch	Dinner**  

So far **ABBA** has inspired:  

- [a Mental Health Charity Drive](https://www.reddit.com/r/FurnaceParty/comments/arzchm/do_attend_help_a_friend_mental_health_charity/) (which is still running!)  
- [a beer from the local Crime and Punishment brewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/FurnaceParty/comments/as44st/crime_and_punishment_is_gonna_sedate_us_with_beer/)

Whether or not those in attendence have bulldozers or steel furnace equipment, April 27th will be a party. Join us and decide if you're Team Steel or Team Cement.  

Of course, you'll be sedated first.

/r/BreakfastWithAView is a photo based subreddited dedicated to photographs of breakfast with a view, its pretty self explanatory but that doesn't take away from how beautiful the shots on here are! It has made me want to try a lot of different meals as well as visit a ton of places!

The sub is quite simply a place for memes of philosophy to be posted. They are typically accessible to all, with not much of a philosophy background needed.

The sub is a needed differentiation from r/philosophy which is more about philosophical debate, while r/philosophymemes is more focused on light-hearted jokes.

 This subreddit is dedicated to stuff before post production, CGI, sound effects etc. in TV and Movies. We live in an era where Cg is being relied on more and more as well as the CG is getting better and better.

There are many different types of art: Holocene cave paintings, the Greek's and the Roman's ancient Classical art, the Romantic era, and contemporary art, which is what we will be looking at. What is contemporary art? Simply put, it is the art of today. Much of the art of today questions the purpose of the paintbrush, asserting that it is simply not good enough to enjoy a piece of artwork for what it is, we must deconstruct it, and find out why we like it. Perhaps, we can find out what that might say about us.  

Dragons.  
Fucking.  
Cars.  
  
Reddit is a hub of many interests, such as news, prose, [racism](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald), and artwork. One of my personal favourite subreddits centred around art is /r/dragonsfuckingcars, a sub dedicated to the discussion and appreciation of artwork depicting dragons engaging in sexual intercourse with automobiles.  
  
It's a lovely sub.  
  
When you look at a piece of artwork on this subreddit, such as the recent release [""It’s to big fam...""](https://i.redd.it/ign87k2mpo031.jpg) by renowned artist */u/its-high-nude*, try not to just see it for what it literally is, wonder *why* it's funny or disgusting ~~or arousing~~. Why are these cars being defiled? Why did the artist use the Pixar character Lightning McQueen? If we can answer those questions, we may realise that /r/dragonsfuckingcars is not just a funny ""wtf"" subreddit, and we will unlock the truth that these dragons fucking these cars symbolise something deep about LIFE. That's why I love this subreddit.   
  
Well either that or because it's hot.

r/originalmemes is a subreddit for posting memes that you have created and that haven’t been posted anywhere else on the internet, all ethically sourced. These days it is very difficult to find memes that you know for sure are OC, they may label it as OC but there is nothing stopping them from taking someone else’s unwatermarked meme. We wanted a system with more integrity than simply an OC label, so our dedicated team of moderators run every single image submitted through various reverse image searching engines to provide an absolute guarantee to viewers that the karma they are giving is going directly to the rightful owner and creator of the meme.

On the 18th of December, I submitted a request on redditrequest to become the moderator of this community as the only moderator who was left hadn’t used reddit in over 5 years. 3 days later, my request was granted. When I first received the subreddit on the 21st it was at 145 subscribers, had many unmoderated posts, had absolutely no CSS decoration and overall was in a terrible state. And in only a few days me and my moderators have transformed the subreddit into what you see today, sitting at 250 subscribers.

We want a place where people who create original memes can post them freely and receive the credit they deserve without being drowned out by reposts and with a solid OC verification system that can ensure this happens. Although running every individual post through engines is quite time-consuming we believe it is worth it to keep our subreddit a transparent and trustworthy place for people to post and find memes that are guaranteed original, the time it takes is a necessary sacrifice for this level of integrity.

On 
We accept that we may think a meme is a repost because the same person uploaded the meme previously under a different account. Although this is unlikely to happen, we make sure we have an easy and painless way for people to appeal the decision and submit proof of account ownership using a method of their choice using this: [Flair messages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQBPVGAiPrbjA8Eg7hvEUmflo8N7qRNR/view?usp=sharing). Overall we put much care into looking at the account in question to look for similarities to ensure this occurs as little as possible.

Thank you for your time and we hope you will consider our subreddit in pursuit of meme justice and original content.

Tired of useful TIL posts?  Want some valuable information that is completely and utterly useless, stupid, or wildly incorrect?  Well then you're in luck, because Yahoo Answers is coming at you with the greatest sub since the meatball marinara with a side of Arby's secret sauce, r/ShittyTodayILearned!  

r/ShittyTodayILearned is a subreddit for facts that aren't facts.  They're un-facts.  This sub was created by a couple of guys who were like ""hey, let's make a Subreddit"", and the other one was like ""okay"".  And that's how the sub was created.  Thankfully, those two mods were smart enough to know that Honey Wheat is the worst kind of bread, and made their sub on Whole Wheat, which is superior in every way, shape, form, and don't question me because I'm absolutely right, plain sucks.  This helped the sub to be slightly more sturdy, and not fall apart like every other sub made by a bunch of newbies.

Since then, it has become a fertile swamp of quality posts, such as revealing a species of colorful, talking penguins that live in rain forests and can actually fly, or helping a man to realize that he was actually married to a fish.  Did you know that space smells like Tuna Helper, or that the Grammy's isn't an awards show for grandmothers?  Well now you know!  I would have never been able to become as smart as I am today without the insightful knowledge gained from that sub.  Let's take it to some commentary from the wonderful, amazing friends I have on that sub:

Friend 1 Testimony:
Friend 2 Testimony:

Wasn't that great?!  They're such amazing people.  Come on by, and drop off your Onion, alternative, and obvious facts, where they will die a slow and horrible, existential death in the deep, bottomless depths of Reddit and the internet.  You should do that, because what else are you going to do?  Sit on another sub and actually learn something, or engage in a ""genuine"" conversation?  Reality is for winners, and almost everybody hates winners.  Come be a loser with us!

/r/ImaginaryHorrors is an image based subreddit dedicated to scary and haunting art. Growing up I've always loved Halloween and all things Spooky, I don't know what that says about me or my parents, but it's always been something I was really interested in. So when I became a moderator for the INE (Imaginary Network) /r/ImaginaryHorrors was one of the ones that once I found it I was hooked! Here you will find the [creepy](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/010/874/585/large/stefan-koidl-tallandskinny.jpg?1526674661), [unnerving](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/573/278/large/christophe-young-71a.jpg?1507060259), [shocking](https://img00.deviantart.net/4ac6/i/2012/277/9/b/whisper_by_lpeters-d5gsuff.jpg), [spooky](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/508/484/large/koveck-antonio-garcia-nightmare.jpg?1513207413) and [all things scary](https://img00.deviantart.net/4ac6/i/2012/277/9/b/whisper_by_lpeters-d5gsuff.jpg). 
    
It amazes me how talented and creative these artists can be as well as how vivid their imagination is. Every artist has their own style which makes every piece special. Here you will find a group of people eager to share in fine works, to expand their horizons, and to perpetuate a crucial art form: the careful application of beauty which in this case is dedicated to the spooky, shocking, and horrific. 

The subreddit, part of the large I[maginary Network: Extended](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork/), becomes the catch-all subreddit for art that might not fit perfectly in the other communities. Everything that can be dreamt of can fit in here, so you end up with an intriguing variety of submissions, though they seem to be linked through their ability to inspire awe.

**Here is a taste of what you'll find on here:**

/r/JacksFilms, is a subreddit dedicated to the youtuber Jack Douglass. Please help contribute by posting links, discussions, and anything else. 

John Patrick ""Jack"" Douglass (born June 30, 1988), known online by his YouTube channel name Jacksfilms, is an American YouTube personality, comedian, Web-based entertainer, film artist and musician. Although his YouTube channel initially consisted primarily of infomercial parodies, sketches, and humorous music videos (often with self-composed music), as his audience grew he expanded into comedy series centered around comments and submissions from viewers. These include JackAsk, in which he answers viewer-submitted questions via Twitter and comments on his videos; Yesterday I Asked You (YIAY), in which he asks his viewers a question or gives them a challenge (i.e. make a drawing or animation, create a website) and picks his favorite answers or submissions in the following video; and Your Grammar Sucks, in which he ridicules viewer-submitted examples of incorrect grammar and spelling from across the Internet.

**1,606** *readers* for **2 Years!**


The Great Filter is the most urgent question Mankind has ever faced. It's the solution to the Fermi Paradox. The Great Filter is Robin Hanson's hypothesis there are no other technological civilizations (not even on Earth) because they die before they colonize a galaxy. The mission of r/GreatFilter is to raise awareness of the value and fragility of life, and thus the importance of peaceful colonization of space beyond Earth, one rock at a time. Is our destiny literally in our stars?

We are a small subreddit, having reached 1000 subscribers only recently:

* [r/GreatFilter reached 1000 subscribers! : r/GreatFilter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFilter/comments/a68lql/rgreatfilter_reached_1000_subscribers/)

But despite our small size, we have succeeded in getting the attention of millions of Kurzgesagt viewers when they did a video about an original idea first published in r/GreatFilter:

* [Remember badon's Gravity Trap? Kurzgesagt writers must read r/GreatFilter, because they made a video about it: End of Space – Creating a Prison for Humanity : r/GreatFilter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFilter/comments/a0kcn2/remember_badons_gravity_trap_kurzgesagt_writers/)

The concept of the Great Filter needs to become a topic of daily conversation, because Mankind is facing enormous changes in our present and our near future, and the only precedent we know of for similar changes involve mass extinctions of nearly every species. Obviously, that's bad and does not bode well for our survival chances. We don't want to become extinct if we can avoid it, but one thing we know so far is no matter how dominant, and no mater how numerous, no species is invulnerable to extinction. In short, we are all definitely going to die if we don't get our act together as a united civilization and figure out what to do to stop it.

Stopping our own extinction is not going to be easy because no one knows for sure what the Great Filter is. Even the most confident appraisals immediately incite controversy:

* [This is how we know with high confidence intelligence and technological civilizations are extremely rare in the universe : r/GreatFilter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFilter/comments/a53guv/this_is_how_we_know_with_high_confidence/)

Absent scientific certainty, we look to sci-fi for inspiration and perhaps even guidance, with the top post of all time being a sci-fi short story:

* [[Sci-Fi] The Great Filters : r/GreatFilter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFilter/comments/9v5qx0/scifi_the_great_filters/)

The realm of the Great Filter is unexplored and full of mystery, so there is much to discover if we only look and ponder what we see. Maybe YOU will play an important role in the discussions that will someday save us all.

A sub that you can post to your hearts content, mods are friendly and don't censor your posts based on bias or whatnot. Good community of helpful users, who don't mind to lend an opinion, even to the noobiest of questions!

I believe this community needs recognition and there are very few remaining true subs dedicated to the discussion of privacy and security topics left on Reddit that aren't prompted by commercialism and bias.

We aim to provide research, useful tools, opinion pieces plus much more on the triple threat from corporations, cyber-criminals, and governments. Now more than ever is it important to protect yourself and restrict corporations that put our data at risk, manipulate us and mine our data all to make a quick dollar off us. Being reckless with our data leaves us open to attack from cyber-criminals, and those attacks are increasing in number. Meanwhile, government agencies are using this wealth of data to spy on us, and if they go the way of China, our governments may end up controlling us very efficiently with the data we have given them.

&#x200B;

Feel free to discuss, ask for advice and much more without bias or censorship!

We don't filter posts on this subreddit to only allow what we ""like"" as good content, as some Subreddits like to do.

 The Real Joke is meant to be a joke subreddit, spawned from the infamous phrase 'the real joke is always in the comment section'. The best part of these jokes are they are in the moment and come as first thoughts so they feel more genuine than worked out bits. Comedians have to go on stage and build a world. Set the table, provide context, and nail the punchline. Repeat. The funny friend is reacting and commenting on what's going on, and the shared experiences you have. The set up is already done. You couldn't go on stage and say ""so me and my buddies were hanging out...""
 
I really recommend check this subreddit out because it celebrates the creativity of the users on reddit and other sites, I've found myself getting stuck in scrolling through  and laughing for hours.

If it's big, if it's mean, if it's friendly, and especially if it's destroyed Tokyo - it belongs here. All the best Kaiju (Japanese or otherwise) discussion and news.

Kaiju originally referred to monsters and creatures from ancient Japanese legends. The word ""Kaiju"" first appears in Classic of Mountains and Seas. After Sakoku, opening Japan to foreign relations, Japanese came to use the term kaiju to express concepts from paleontology and legendary creatures from around the world. For example, in 1908, during the Meiji period, it was suggested that the extinct Ceratosaurus was alive in Alaska, referred to as kaiju. However, there are no traditional depictions of kaiju or kaiju-like creatures in Japanese folklore but rather the origins of kaiju are found in film. 

The title of the first film with the name of the Kaiju is an atomic Kaiju appears (原子怪獣現わる Genshi Kaiju ga Arawareru), the title of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms in Japan. Gojira (transliterated to Godzilla) is regarded as the first kaiju film and was released in 1954. Tomoyuki Tanaka, a producer for Toho Studios in Tokyo, needed a film to release after his previous project was halted and upon seeing how well American Hollywood giant monster movie genre films King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms had done in the box offices of Japan, as well as personally being a fan of the films, Tomoyuki Tanaka set out to make a new movie based on those American giant monster movies and created Godzilla. 

Tomoyuki Tanaka aimed to combine Hollywood giant monster movies with the re-emerged Japanese fears of atomic weapons, which came about due to the Daigo Fukuryū Maru fishing boat incident, and so he put a team together and created the concept of a radioactive giant creature emerging from the depths of the ocean which would become the iconic monster Godzilla. Godzilla was initially met with commercial success in Japan, inspiring an entire genre that came to be known as kaiju movies.

The mirror from your old house just won't fit, and it has been sitting in the corner of your garage for three years. It's time to get rid of it. You wiped it clean and was ready to take a few photos of it for Facebook - but wait! You just can't get rid of your own reflection in the mirror! You moved your phone around, and things started to get worse. There came your [face](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirrorsforsale/comments/a655y2/found_on_facebook/), your [doggo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirrorsforsale/comments/86f4y6/lone_doggo/), and... um... even [spiderman](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirrorsforsale/comments/a0sjs4/this_is_the_best_one_ive_ever_seen/)!

As you've seen, /r/Mirrorsforsale is a gallery of mirrors for sale but with some elements of surprise. We laugh at unintentional reflections in mirrors people post on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, etc. Since it's hard to defy the physics of light, expect to see all kinds of oddity showing up unexpectedly in mirrors. This includes dogs, cats, weird items, funny postures, and emotions!

Enjoy mirrors for sale, and take care when selling your own mirrors! [*aha! if i stand here, i won't be in this mirror!*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirrorsforsale/comments/a9rkfh/no_escape/)

But all this memeing only serves one purpose: The reconquest of Constantinople. The city was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and sacked by the Ottomans in 1453. With enough followers r/SPQRposting will start to [fundraise](https://www.reddit.com/r/spqrposting/comments/a8j1l6/support_the_reconquest_of_constantinople/?utm_source=reddit-android) the money necessary to raise at least four legions and finally march on the city, and sack it from the pesky Ottomans.

Supporters of the Optimates or Populares, the two mayor politcal parties at the time, are both welcome in the community. Depending on who you ask, they will like the one or the other, but they will definitly hate you for your choise. Julius Caesar is one of the most famous populares. To help him cross the Rubicon and march on Rome, r/SPQRposting made a [video](https://youtu.be/zKAQNOmPDlo) to raise donations for his endeavour. 

With the upcomming Ides of March, the day Julius Caesar was stabbed in 44 BC by many senators and his close friend Brutus, r/SPQRposting will once again focus on important historic events and festivals. These play an important role in the shaping of the subreddit and are marked with [proper memes and contests.](https://www.reddit.com/r/spqrposting/comments/aqo3ex/oh_yes_i_wish/)

/r/graphicnovels is a small but thriving community dedicated to the discussion of all things graphic novels!

**What is a Graphic Novel?**

The term Graphic Novel was first used to label comics published solely in book format, but nowadays it’s used both for labeling collections of monthly single-issue comics and stand-alone comics in book format. It’s a term popularized by Comics Legend Will Eisner within the US comics community to avoid the stigma usually associated with monthly single issue comics in the US. The term was popularized in the mainstream with the success of Art Speigelman’s Maus , Alan Moore’s and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen and Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns. The first comics to be marketed as Graphic Novels were Bloodstar ,an adaptation of a story by famed Sword-and-Sorcery writer Robert E. Howard, by writer-artist Richard Corben, Beyond Time and Again by underground cartoonist George Metzger and Chandler: Red Tide by Jim Steranko, all released in around 1976, though Steranko’s comic was mostly considered an “illustrated Novel” rather than a Graphic Novel. The definition and usage of the term Graphic Novel is debated, but the most commonly used definition is that of Book stores and publishers who define it as comics published in paperback or hardback format, regardless of whether or not it has been published in any format, like in magazines or online, prior to its publication in hardback and paperback. If you have an opinion on the matter, feel free to start a thread discussing it.

/r/Asylums deserves to be recognized to highlight the uniqueness that Reddit offers, and shows the world. A uniqueness that shows users the often times unnecessary but still beautiful extravagance of old Psychiatric Hospitals, and Asylums, some of which are still standing today, while others are not. We strive for advocacy, and the preservation of these historic buildings. We do so through Preservation Alerts, and getting the word out. We've done this for two State Hospitals so far, the Fergus Falls State Hospital, we did so by encouraging our users to lobby the city government, by contacting their city offices, emailing and leaving messages with their Mayor. Our other advocacy work surrounded the closing of Allentown State Hospital, and I would like to think our users contributed to the petition that was made in support of the buildings' preservation.

 A place for anything related to Pacific Rim. Post anything Pacific Rim, from toys to movies, screenshots to trailers, anything and everything Pacific Rim belongs here.

Pacific Rim is a 2013 American science fiction monster film directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay was written by Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju,[a] colossal sea monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers,[b] gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by at least two pilots, whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju. 

A controversial sequel titled Pacific Rim Uprising, directed by Steven S. DeKnight and produced by Del Toro, with Kikuchi, Day, and Gorman reprising their roles, and Universal Pictures taking the film distribution, was released on March 23, 2018.

On November 8, 2018, Netflix announced an original anime series that will expand upon the story of the first two live action movies.

Almost everyone has seen Star Wars. Maybe you've seen the newest Episodes 7 and 8 or maybe you enjoy the Prequels more. Much like /r/PrequelMemes & /r/SequelMemes, /r/OTMemes is a subreddit dedicated to the Original Trilogy of Star Wars films. The community and mods alike genuinely enjoy these films. The users are always very kind, and extremely talented.

Welcome to /r/lightsabers. This sub is dedicated to everything lightsabers. Feel free to post anything regarding lightsabers. For Designs to finished products, Hilts to accessory items, it can be discussed here.

The lightsaber is the weapon of a Jedi, an elegant weapon of a more civilized age. It can be used to cut through blast doors or enemies alike. Using the Force, a Jedi can predict and deflect incoming blaster bolts, and reflect them. 

Although use of the lightsaber is the mark of a Jedi, it is also used by their sworn enemies, the Sith. Typically, a Jedi’s lightsaber blade is colored green or blue. Other colors are rare but possible, most notably seen with Jedi Master Mace Windu’s purple blade. Sith uniformly use red-bladed lightsabers -- an intense, aggressive color that represents their view of the Force.


An essential rite of passage for young Jedi is the Gathering. In the Gathering, younglings go to the frigid ice world Ilum, where they search for kyber crystals to build their first lightsabers. The crystals are located in the planet’s Crystal Cave, an intimidating maze, and “call out” to the Jedi they are in tune with. Once the correct crystal has been found, younglings rendezvous with Huyang, and ancient droid who chooses the parts necessary to build a lightsaber. With everything in place, younglings complete the ritual by constructing their Jedi weapons through a graceful use of the Force.

>**r/SeriousConversation** - 
For in-depth discussions, offer a theory, share an opinion, or pose a question about (almost) any heavier topics you can think of.

r/SeriousConversation (SC) was created as an offshoot of r/CasualConversation (CC) by the same mods to have a similar atmosphere and general *coziness* our users are use to. To have more in-depth discussion on the more serious topics. We all know that life isn't always casual. Sometimes we need to process serious events, ideas, topics happening in our worlds. So here we go! 

Here are some posts noteworthy posts:

- [What to do when the art you love is made by someone you hate.](https://redd.it/aet441)
- [Does anyone feel like alcohol culture Is destructive ?](https://redd.it/a44wa5)
- [Schools need to recognise that in real life we have access to the internet in almost all scenarios.](https://redd.it/aehfja)
- [I think if relationships were not such a societal nailed in thing many people would opt to be single and be be happy that way](https://redd.it/af1xgd)

Over the course of the beginning of the year we did a bit of a subreddit overhaul and update. By giving a style update, rules update and post flairs. Which seems to work. Since our efforts to update the sub we've seen a significant amount of really good high-effort discussion on various topics.

/r/ButVideos is a place to celebrate editing usually popular scenes or videos to something funny, strange, or anything really - everything is allowed:

Take [""Friends but without the laugh track""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ButVideos/comments/a71wr7/friends_but_instead_of_a_laugh_track_it_just/) as an example of one of  the many edited videos, or [""Smash Mouth's 'All Star' but it's following the conventions of Bach's Chorales""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ButVideos/comments/acwgbd/all_star_but_its_a_bach_chorale_following_the/) as an example of one of the music-based edits.

Many submissions are funny and light-themed. However there really is an art in changing popular video. Take [""Steamed Hams but every word is replaced by its first occurance""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ButVideos/comments/a82aqa/steamed_hams_but_every_word_is_replaced_with_its/): It's fascinating seeing the video dissected; many of the submissions change the way you see the original.

**16,323** *readers* for **1 year!**

**r/titanfolk** has been created on May 1, 2018 as a meme subreddit for manga series *Attack on Titan* (*Shingeki no Kyojin*). Today, season 3 of the anime returns with its 2nd part. So, the first anniversary of the sub and this great television event happen only a few days apart! The subreddit was inspired by the free minds of the *Game of Thrones* fandom *freefolk*, a series manga creator Hajime Isayama is a big fan of. This emotionally moved community holds reddit's healthy netiquette highly and excels in welcoming fun threads.

The subreddit mainly revolves about meme and shitposts, another thing we know the [manga author enjoys as well](https://shop.r10s.jp/book/cabinet/0576/4910047830576.jpg). The highlight is the monthly shitposting thread in anticipation of the new chapter, resulting in ~20,000 comments in a few days. The manga dominates the sub since almost all subscribers are up to date with it. However, when the anime airs, anime memes are around, too. People are very excited for the 10 upcoming episodes. When the 1st part of season 3 ended, even a new group called u/TheKrabsFaction formed to post a meme every day from the end of part 1 to the start of part 2, today, in anticipation of the anime. Yesterday, the final meme was posted to give it up for day 195. The wait is over!

For every manga volume, a special competition is hold to design *your* volume cover, by using fanart or completely original content. The community then [choses](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/anghax/results_volume_28_cover_contest/) [winners](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/ag7gsl/the_last_bastion/) for certain categories. Moreover, you'll find many deep discussions on the sub, news, fanart (properly credited), users analyzing the latest chapters or wondering what Yeager is doing, try to find answers to all the mysteries and characters' motives.

**What is *Attack on Titan*?** A manga series by Hajime Isayama started in 2009 (10th anniversary is just a few months away!), adapted into an anime in 2013. Setting: A century ago, the giant titans appeared and consumed most of mankind. However, the remnants of humanity found refuge behind 50m high walls. Protected by the walls, humanity forgot the threat from outside. Hundred years later, they received a grim reminder by the Colossal Titan destroying the outer wall. The story follows the childhood friends Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert who dream of exploring the world beyond those walls. Eren lost his mom to the Smiling Titan and is filled with hate and the resolve to eviscerate all titans.

#Mod Interview:

**What do you enjoy most about r/titanfolk?**

u/Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri: memes

u/H-K_47: Their ability and willingness to parody anything and everything. Even in the darkest chapters dealing with the heaviest themes and depicting the most brutal and emotional events, the subreddit manages to squeeze out real humour! No panel is safe, no moment is too small. It can be super funny and a great way to chill and have fun after the initial hype of the chapter. Also helps to appreciate the work and details put into each page or frame.

u/sleepy-heichou: Humour brings people together, and I think this is one of r/titanfolk’s strongest points. We come to the sub to have fun, to smile, to have a good time. And when people are happy, the interactions are a lot more fruitful and varied. It’s easier to let loose and be yourself. I think it’s also nice that our experiences amongst one another centre around such an intriguing story as SnK’s, with its richly-layered plot that often inspire discussion and critique. Overall, I feel like the shared experience of being a fan of SnK, as well as the personal interactions amongst users, are what make r/titanfolk interesting and enjoyable.

u/Hist2506: I enjoy a lot the relaxed atmosphere in this subreddit, users are very friendly, we feel at ease:)

u/invaderzz: I like how relaxed the community is. Everyone is really friendly is chill, its just a fun place to make memes and talk about the manga.

**How did you get involved in r/titanfolk?**

u/Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri: memes

u/Somebody-Nice: Looong story. I helped set it up, back when Niye wanted to create a sub, dedicated to memes, leaks and overall having a good atmosphere. Thought it was a great idea, but work and school have unfortunately taken too much of my time, so I'm no longer as active as I'd like to be. One day I will hopefully become more active in here - I miss my fellows moderators and the members and shitposters we have in here!!

**Who is your favorite character and why?**

u/EXACTLY_RIGHT: I don't have a favourite character. I can't lol. They might die and I might get my heart broken.

u/H-K_47: Definitely COMMANDER ERWIN SMITH! For the longest time it was Armin, but Erwin decisively won me over. Smart, brave, heroic, charismatic, stoic. All around a fantastic commander who did so much for the Survey Corps and humanity as a whole. But the greatest part about him is how human he is. Though he appears larger than life, the insights we get into his motives, his personality, and his flaws transcend him beyond being just a badass. His character arc and developments throughout the series have been absolutely beautiful and touching. Erwin all the way! My runner up would have to be Eren Jaeger though. The man has come far, and he's really been shining in the latest arcs!

u/sleepy-heichou: Levi has always been my favourite character in the series. Many people see him as simply a fan-service character, and he is probably (definitely?) one of the most widely-shipped people in the series, but I think it would help a lot if people saw him beyond that. Levi is rough, and comes off as cold and unattached, but he cares a lot about those around him. He rarely says it, but his actions speak a lot louder. He also has a very mature sense of responsibility. He seems to prefer the solace of being alone, but when given the choice, he’d choose to fight for others. Not to mention, I feel like he is that one person whom you could always rely on to do the right thing, regardless of the situation. To be honest, I also think there’s such a strong sense of irony to his character. In a world such as that of Shingeki no Kyojin, survivability is paramount. And yet, in Levi’s case, his ability to survive has become a curse, as he has outlived almost everyone he’s ever known. I find it doubly interesting that despite this, he continues fighting and refuses to succumb to despair. I think Levi is a character that the very story of SnK needs - the embodiment of the human spirit’s persistence and strength in the face of seeming defeat.

u/Hist2506: I really appreciate Historia as a character who fought to be proud of herself, she really became an example of bravery in this story, and sent a strong message: “Stand tall and be proud of who you are”

u/invaderzz: My favorite character is Eren. His growth from an immature, annoying brat into a well developed mature character is done extremely well. Early on in the story a lot of people hate him, but almost everyone grows to like him eventually. I think he is a great protagonist.

u/Somebody-Nice: Zeke is by far my favorite, because he is the most interesting character in my opinion (fight me). I'm excited to see how his story concludes.

**Which is your favorite scene of the anime?**

u/EXACTLY_RIGHT: My favourite scene must be in S2 Ep6 when the reveal happens. The music was so godly. The animation was great, the VA's gave it their all.

u/H-K_47: Oh man, it's almost impossible to choose! There are just so many fantastic moments all throughout! If I had to pick, my favourites would be the Colossal Titan appearing at Trost District, ""that"" scene with Reiner and Bertolt on the Wall, and Erwin's charges in Season 2 (SHINZOU WO SASAGEYO! and ADVANCE!). Those are definitely my favourite moments in the anime (so far)!

u/Hist2506: Very tough choice:)... I really enjoyed Historia’s speech when she claims to be the enemy of humanity in the first part of the season 3

u/invaderzz: My favorite scene in the anime is many people's favorite, Season 2 episode 6. I remember watching it for the first time before I read the manga and when I watched it I realized that AoT was really something special. It's one of my favorite episodes in any show ever, not just aot, specifically because of the entire second half of the episode.

u/Somebody-Nice: Oof, that's a difficult question. There are so many, so I'm just gonna list the first thing that comes in mind: Annie's rampage on the SC, during her first appearance, leading to her sparing a scared Armin - really great stuff!

**What meme makes you laugh so hard that your eyes get teary and your stomach hurts?**

u/EXACTLY_RIGHT: My favourite meme of all time is [**probably this**](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/a69p81/zeke_be_like/). The first time I saw this I laughed so hard I think I peed a little.

u/Somebody-Nice: Another hard one, but every meme inspired by the ""Mikasa, you're a slave"" scene, never cease to crack me up. ""What are you doing, Yeager!!"" is a close second.

r/TheUnicornHorn is a game based subreddit designed to branch off of r/themonkeyspaw.

How is it different? Instead of wishing for positive things, users wish for extremely negative things. It is upon the connectors to grant the wish, however must grant it in a way that turns the wish in a positive way. It is a fun twist on an already established concept.

We hope to make this subreddit an extremely friendly, non toxic community for users to relax in.

In the future, we hope to be at the same level as  r/themonkeyspaw, and be in unison with them.

**4,711** *Nerds* for **9 years!**

A subreddit for fans of James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd, and related works by Cinemassacre.

This is a fan-run subreddit. Unlike the ""official"" Cinemassacre subreddit, this subreddit will not violate Reddit's moderator guidelines.

All topics surrounding AVGN and Cinemassacre are welcome to be discussed here. Users should not fear a ban for discussion, they should not fear that their posts will be removed, or that the subreddit will be closed. 

Angry Video Game Nerd (abbreviated as AVGN, and originally known as Bad NES Games and Angry Nintendo Nerd) is an American comedy retrogaming web series, created by and starring James Rolfe. The series centers on Rolfe's character ""The Nerd"", a short-tempered and foul-mouthed video game fanatic who delivers commentary on retro games he considers to be of poor quality. While the series began with Rolfe simply playing games while delivering a running commentary, the show would eventually grow in scope to encompass sketches featuring guest characters, reviews of gaming consoles and peripherals, and short lectures about video game history and culture



Starting out as an independent filmmaker, Rolfe intended for his earliest videos of the Nerd character to be a joke privately shown to his friends.In 2004, with collaboration from his friend Mike Matei, Rolfe put the Angry Nintendo Nerd videos on his website, Cinemassacre.com. In 2006, Matei persuaded Rolfe to put his work on YouTube, where it gained popularity. In 2007, the series became a program on ScrewAttack and GameTrailers, where it was renamed The Angry Video Game Nerd to avoid trademark issues with Nintendo, and to allow Rolfe to review games from non-Nintendo consoles.From there, the series became a cult success, and Rolfe began appearing as the character in various other media such as a feature-length film and video games, and many public appearances.

Angry Video Game Nerd is considered one of the pioneers of internet review videos, being highly influential on the style and format of subsequent video reviewers as well as being responsible for helping to bring the concept into the mainstream

 /r/KnottsBerryFarm is a subreddit dedicated to the amusement park. Knott's Berry Farm is a 57-acre (23 ha) theme park located in Buena Park, California, and owned by Cedar Fair. In 2017, it was the tenth-most-visited theme park in North America. Knott's Berry Farm is also the most-visited theme park in the Cedar Fair chain.[1] On the Cedar Fair Q4 2018 Earnings Call, President & CEO Richard Zimmerman said ""Knott's has grown, as we've said, to over 6 million people a year, probably the most attended regional theme park in the world now."" The park features 40 rides including roller coasters, family rides, dark rides and water rides, and it employs approximately 10,000 people.[2] Unlike the rest of the Cedar Fair parks which are amusement parks, Knott's Berry Farm is the only theme park in the Cedar Fair chain.

The origin of the theme park dates back to the mid 1920s, when Walter Knott and his family began selling berry products at a roadside stand along State Route 39 in California. By the 1940s, a restaurant, several shops, and other attractions had been constructed on the property to entertain a growing number of visitors, including a replica ghost town. The site continued its transformation into a modern amusement park over the next two decades, and an admission charge was added in 1968. The park was sold to Cedar Fair in the late 1990s, and the family's food business was eventually acquired by The J. M. Smucker Company.

The Cuddle Puddle has one goal: Uplift our subscribers with the warmth that is felt from animals Cuddling with other animals. The act of Cuddling releases a wonderful chemical called ""Oxytocin"" and we can't get enough of it. We especially believe our content is at peak Cuddling Capacity when we have unique and mixed animals Cuddling; Puppies with piglets, Dogs and Cats, or even a Cuddle Puddle between a Lion, Tiger and Bear that were all rescued and raised together (check out our Subreddit banner on desktop).

The Cuddle Puddle gets its special warmth from our focus being solely on the intimate act of Cuddling. As much as we love the wide range of adorable animal content reddit has to offer, it's the closeness, the connection and the warmth of animals Cuddling with other animals that we're after. Pull up a cozy seat, grab a cup of something warm and get lost in the wonder of The Cuddle Puddle.

**1,321,094** ents *blazing it* for **10 years**!

&nbsp;

Every year on April 20th, SrotD features a sub about weed, for reasons that should be obvious. Well, except last year, where we promptly forgot about it. And I guess there was [2 years before that] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4fngb9/april_20th_2016_rperiwinkle_more_than_just_a/), but that was about an April Fool's joke, so that one is alrght. And then there was [2 years before *that*] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/23hpyo/april_20th_2014_rredditthroughhistory_answering/), too... Alright, so there have been 2 instances where we've featured a weed related sub on 4/20 in the past 7 years. Not a good track record. But you know what? It's a new year, a new chance to feature one, I [kinda sorta promised to do it a year ago] (https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/8dnux2/-/dxp7bsy), I'm completely dankrupt and need to vent, let's do this. 


Since we last featured /r/Trees. [all the way back in 2012 of this day] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/sjao9/april_20_2012_rtrees_hey_manhope_youre_likehaving/), it's gained over 1.1 million subs! Shit, that's a lot of weed being smoked. Weed has always been a pretty big cultural thing, but it's amazing how much that cultural stigma has actually evolved. In the 50's, smoking the eViL rEeFeRs was a massive issue in the public eye. In only a few decades it's changed into being the cool plant that's a better alternative to alcohol. And rightfully so, since weed is awesome. And now, with it actually becoming legalised in many places around the world, it seems that it's popularity is only going to rise.

/r/Trees, incase you're not aware, is the hub for all weed related discussion on Reddit. Whether you're an experienced ent or a newbie who just bought their first gram, /r/Trees is the place to discuss it (there's also /r/saplings if you're completely new!) Feel free to ask questions, or tell stories about that one time you were absolutely stoned off your head and did some dumb shit, or just post pictures of joints ~~like everyone else does~~!


Now, because I'm sure a few of our readers are going to be having their first experience with cannabis today, here's just a few tips for you.

* Smoke with a friend! Weed is always better when you're in the company of others. Doing it alone is also good though.

* Bring water & snacks. Munchies are real, folks, and everything tastes better when high. Water is also good since your throat will probably be fucked after your first few hits. If you have access to fast food, even better!

* Music is a must have, regardless of if you like the music or not.

* **Don't get too high**. A common thing with people new to weed is that they don't feel high immediately after taking a hit, and then take several more hits until they do. This is a bad idea. Your first time smoking, you won't feel high immediately, you just won't, it'll kick in after maybe 5-10 minutes. Smoking a massive amount will completely fuck you up and it probably won't be enjoyable in the slightest. Smoke in moderation, if you really don't feel anything after a few hits and waiting a bit, then decide for yourself if taking more is a good idea. Also, **this applies fucking hundredfold to edibles.** Go into r/TIFU and read the dozens of stories of people not realising that edibles are 1: fucking strong, and 2: take a good while to set in.

* Most importantly, **have fun!** I remember I spent my first time high being way too cautious. I was making sure I wasn't ""acting stoned"" and just trying to function properly and shit. It was fun, but it wasn't all that fun. Just enjoy yourself. Put on some music and relax.

&nbsp;

So to all the stoners of the day, old or new, I raise my joint to you all ^(~~or I would, if I wasn't out of fucking weed~~) , and wish you all a pleas*ent* 4/20!

This is a sub mainly dedicated to the YouTube channel Jelle's Marble Runs series called the Marblelympics, where teams of marbles compete in their own Olympic Games including a Relay Race, Long Jump, and many other events. 

MarbleLympics, also known as the Marble Olympics, is a series of fictional marble sports events created by Dutch YouTubers Jelle Bakker and Dion Bakker, who run a channel named Jelle's Marble Runs on Youtube.[1][2] The series parodies the traditional Olympic Games by displaying some Olympic sports in a modified way to be portrayed by marbles and commentated by Greg Woods. In the games, there are 16 teams that participate in them, leading up to the Finals and Semi-Finals, in which they determine the medalists in the MarbleLympics.[3] Each year, Bakker uploads a new series of the MarbleLympics, with different events and teams each year, which are introduced in the Qualifying round. As of February 2019, the channel, gaining much popularity, has over 300,000 subscribers with more than 117 million views.

This is the subreddit for fans of THE DOUGHBOYS, which is a comedy podcast dedicated to reviewing chain restaurants. Hosted by classic odd couple Nick ""Burger Boy"" Wiger and Mike ""The Spoonman"" Mitchell, each episode features a different celebrity guest -- most often people connected to the L.A. comedy scene.

The show has regularly appeared on the EARWOLF subreddit -- even though it's not an Earwolf podcast, the people on the show are part of the same West Coast comedy scene. As THE DOUGHBOYS have grown in popularity, the dedicated /r/doughboys/ sub is becoming more of its own hub.

In addition to discussion of THE DOUGHBOYS, the sub deals with topics like ""The Birthday Boys"" show, guests and friends of Nick and Mitch, and fast food in general. Several Doughboys-related podcasts including ""Worst-Case Scenario"", ""Deli Boys"" and ""The Bread Cast"" have found a home here as well.

/r/SmallYTChannel is a subreddit that lends itself to being spammed with low quality posts, begging for subscribers. The philosophy of /r/SmallYTChannel isn't free advertising, its for feedback to lead to high quality content on YouTube, helping your channel grow, and allowing you to create an active community.

You 'spend' 3λ every time you submit to /r/SmallYTChannel. You get 1λ when the OP of the thread gives you lambda, when you give high-quality advice and feedback. The OP also receives 1λ. Only the OP can give λ, and only once per thread [the OP can now give λ multiple times but the OP will only get λ once]. They do this by commenting !givelambda to the useful comment. You can check how much lambda you have by using the command !mylambda. 

If you expect people to look at your content and help you out then be sure to do the same for the other content creators on this sub.

Make sure when asking someone to check out a channel your post links to it or you have a link in the comments. If you don't one of the mods will probably pull the link and send you a pm to resubmit. This is so you will have a better chance at exposure.

As time goes by, taking photos becomes more and more convenient  Today, almost any electronic device you buy comes with a camera and it becomes unlikely that you ever find yourself without one. Of course, in front of a great opportunity you may sometimes feel that you do not have the proper tools. If you just have your cell phone, you may wish you had your DSLR or a better camera in general. Still, you have something with you and can take that shot.

/r/Casual_Photography is a subreddit dedicated to photos of the world, or more accurately photos of your world. If you have a smartphone, you have probably noticed many new photography applications pop up every day. Some are good, others useless. The trend seems to be the possibility to add a vintage look to your pictures. For some it will do the trick. If you are serious about photography you may feel limited, though. But, creativity is all about how you can do something different within a frame of rules and limits. Why not limit yourself sometimes to see what you can do?

**2,876** *readers* for **7 years!**

A subreddit for the discussion of all things Dredd, including the upcoming TV series Judge Dredd: Mega-City One.Judge  Joseph Dredd is a fictional character created by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra. He first appeared in the second issue of 2000 AD (1977), a weekly anthology comic magazine. He is the magazine's longest-running character. He also appears in a number of movie and video game adaptations.

Joseph Dredd is a law enforcement and judicial officer in the dystopian future city of Mega-City One, which covers most of the east coast of North America. He is a ""street judge"", empowered to summarily arrest, convict, sentence, and execute criminals.

In Great Britain, the character of Dredd and his name are sometimes invoked in discussions of police states, authoritarianism, and the rule of law.

Judge Dredd made his live action debut in 1995 in Judge Dredd, portrayed by Sylvester Stallone. Later he was portrayed by Karl Urban in the 2012 adaptation Dredd. 

Joseph Dredd is the most famous of the Street Judges that patrol Mega-City One, empowered to instantly convict, sentence, and sometimes execute offenders. Dredd is armed with a ""Lawgiver"", a pistol programmed to recognise only his palm-print, and capable of firing six types of ammunition, a daystick, a boot knife and stun or gas grenades. His helmet obscures his face, except for his mouth and jaw. He rides a large ""Lawmaster"" motorcycle equipped with machine-guns, a powerful laser cannon, and full artificial intelligence capable of responding to orders from the Judge and operating itself.

Dredd's entire face is never shown in the strip. This began as an unofficial guideline, but soon became a rule. As John Wagner explained: ""It sums up the facelessness of justice − justice has no soul. So it isn't necessary for readers to see Dredd's face, and I don't want you to"".

**748** *voters* for **1 year**!

&nbsp;

As the [great savior of the galaxy] (https://i.imgur.com/ChYwfMq.jpg) once said, ""I love democracy"". Democracy is cool. It means everyone gets a say in things. On one hand, this prevents ^(in theory) a small handful of people obtaining total control over a country. But on the other hand, it also means that all the stupid people get a vote. But thankfully, as we all know, everyone on Reddit is a 200 IQ super duper genius, and there are no dumb people here.

^(...Right?)

Regardless of what your opinion is on the whole democracy thing, it's pretty neat. As the other great savior of democracy once said, ""Embrace democracy, or you will be eradicated."" So what if you could have democracy from the comfort of your own home, without having to even take your lazy ass outside to vote? Well now you can, it's called /r/DemocracyExperiment!

/r/DemocracyExperiment has quite the history behind it. It's currently in its third ""experiment"", ie. Democracy simulation. As you may have been able to guess, the subreddit is for emulating democracy on Reddit. At the moment, it's an amalgamation of representational democracy and full democracy, but I'll get back to that in a bit. In the sub, people can vote on things, run for office, enact laws, all that cool democratic shitz that your parents keep talking about at the dinner table. But with added Reddit, making it much cooler (as a great ~~man~~ robot once said, ""Democracy is truth. Communism is death"")!

I'll give you a brief overview of the political system, or the basics at least. You got your Senators, who propose and vote on laws. You got your Mods, who are like senators, but with cool mod powers and shit. There are 3 mods, and currently 4 senators (to be expanded). Elections for mods happen monthly, while elections for senators happen biweekly. When the senate passes a law, the public then have the final vote on pushing it into law, so everyone is involved at some step of the democratic process!

Long time subscribers of ours, while being extremely cool, for one, might also recognize this subreddit from days yonder. This sub was actually featured [back in dinosaur times] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/7g3yza/november_28th_2017_rdemocracyexperiment_where/), when it was just an itty bitty little speck of democracy. At this time it was in its 1st run of the whole democracy schtick. Now it's in its third, this current experiment in its relatively early stages. For you, the lovely readers of SrotD, this means that now is an excellent opportunity for anyone wishing to become a ~~power hungry dictator~~ strong politician to cement themselves in the sub!

So, if there are any freedom loving patriots out there who want to know what actual democracy is like, instead of just a bloated oligarchy with extra steps (I couldn't resist), /r/DemocracyExperiment is an excellent sub for you!

**8532** Luigis *getting second place* for **3 years!**  
  
Now everybody knows Luigi. He's the green half of the Mario brothers! Luigi always seems so happy and excited. But there's something about Luigi that you didn't know. Luigi has spent his whole life in the shadow of his brother, or as I like to call him, 'the other one'. He's had to put up with being called the second Mario brother, the worse Mario brother and even - \*shudders* Green Mario. Well r/luigi_irl perfectly captures the essence of Luigi and one look at the posts on the sub will make you realise - 'Yep, there's a Luigi in me!'. Have you ever had someone be a dick to you? Well then there'a a Luigi in you! Have you ever had someone forget about you because of your sibling? Well then there's a Luigi in you! Luigi has spent all of his life being forgotten, but not anymore! We will prove to the world that Luigi is just as good as the other one, we will prove that he can be the hero too and most importantly we will prove that there is a bit of Luigi in all of us. So come my (Mario) brothers, and join the Green Revolution!

Hello and welcome to /r/ScreenCapsForTheSoul, a subreddit dedicated to sharing your arsenal of relatable screencaps from movies and TV shows to video games and cartoons and everything in between which make you question and think. ^((sort of)^)

As a long time lurker and enthusiast of the popular subreddit /r/me_irl and its spinoffs such as /r/fite_me_irl and /r/snek_irl, I found out that a place for sharing screencaps of various forms of televised media (along with the occasional video game moment) which followed the same theme just wasn't there. So I did what needed to be done. /r/ScreenCapsForTheSoul was created with the intended purpose of sharing relatable screencaps from a range of popular media, mainly focused on movies and TV shows. While I wanted to create something a little different from the previously mentioned subs, I did borrow the core principle of titling all of the posts screencap, partly because it fit the theme well and partly because I'm bad at coming up with titles.

Right now we have a dire lack of posters and it's pretty much just me posting stuff throughout the year whenever I have the free time to do it so I'm not sure how this translates to the rule of the subreddit requiring an active userbase to be nominated. Regardless, I believe in the TV Soul Food community and would like to share my personal favourite posts which reflect the sub aptly.

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, a one-hour dark drama/horror project based on an American comic book series published by Archie Horror, an imprint of Archie Comics, beginning in 2014. This series is also a companion to Riverdale. Anyone is free to join the sub and contribute in discussions.

As her 16th birthday nears, Sabrina must choose between the witch world of her family and the human world of her friends. Based on the Archie comic. The show Reimagines the origin and adventures of Sabrina: the Teenage Witch as a dark coming-of-age story that traffics in horror, the occult and, of course, witchcraft. Tonally in the vein of Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, this adaptation finds Sabrina Spellman wrestling to reconcile her dual nature - half-witch, half-mortal - while standing against the evil forces that threaten her, her family and the daylight world humans inhabit.

With Season 2 premiering today on Netflix I thought it would be a great day to feature it! This is a show I enjoy tremendously its a very high quality show that's more than worth your time!

r/baseballcards is a subreddit where a variety of sports memorabilia enthusiasts go to show off their latest pull or maybe sell/trade with other members. Don’t let our subreddit name fool you, it’s not just baseball cards our community will post about. We enjoy all sport memorabilia posts from football cards, basketball cards, and hockey cards to jerseys, bats, and photos. Sports cards have had made a major comeback from the era called “Junk Wax Era” (80’s and 90’s). It was a era when cards were overly produced and values hold next to nothing because of it. Only one card manufacture (Topps) has a licensing agreement with MLB right now. That helps with a over production of cards that are being made. Other companies still produce but can’t use any MLB logos on the card. Many cards come with autographs or relics (piece of jersey, bat, or other game used memorabilia) now to make the card more personable. This hobby is definitely on the rise and many people who collected as a kid in the “junk wax era” are coming back to this hobby. Many newcomers come to our subreddit and have questions about the cards that they have/had as a kids or what new products they should look into. Our community is great with answering and helping others with whatever question they might have. Many members post their recent “hits” or something they received in the mail from buying/trading. Overall, this is a community that loves to help and is a great place to come and show off your sports memorabilia. We are looking forward to new members joining the hobby and becoming a active user at r/baseballcards.

**330 million** *lovers of All* for **13 years**!

&nbsp;

There's a lot of subreddits out there. You have good ones like /r/Spacedicks, /r/The_Donald and /r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, but you also have shit ones, like /r/Memes, /r/SubredditOfTheDay, /r/Spacedicks, umm, /r/Reddit.com, and... All the others. Don't you wish there was a place on Reddit where you just see good content? Well, /r/All is for you!

/r/All is a lovely subreddit. It has its flaws: The CSS is bare, I'm not allowed to spew racist hate speech on it, and there's no /r/Spacedicks allowed. But the contributors also made pretty sweet content. You have [high quality gaming posts] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9h5phg/anyone_else_remember_when_ea_tried_to_kill_the/), [amazingly hilarious comedy] (https://old.reddit.com/r/ImGoingToHellForThis/comments/afumbz/cultural_enrichment/), [insightful and important debates] (https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b7oklf/oreo_cookies_are_not_that_great/), and of course, [screenshots of a website that an entire community claims to know all about, when in reality they've never been on it and are all 13 years old] (https://old.reddit.com/r/4chan/).


After doing some... Research, I managed to get in contact with the top mod of /r/All (they'd removed the mod list via CSS, presumably, so I had to resort to alternate methods, you may say) and we had a short interview for you!

Surreal memes are (usually humorous) memes that are in a surreal style or contain surreal content. Such memes may be difficult to understand for mere mortals. In the future most memes will look like this.

Unlike mainstream memes, which often comment on or critique popular culture, surreal memes are baseless, abstract creations that make you laugh, but also feel a little strange.

According to /u/Magicsdevil  the founder and a moderator of r/surrealmemes ""Surrealism just makes your mind a little uncomfortable, and at the same time is usually unexpected and requires a little more effort on the part of the consumer,""
 ""are my personal label for memes that can generally get a cheap laugh just like normal memes, but are also a bit disorienting and difficult not because (not just because) of their irony, but because they aren't quite rational or grounded in any particular reality."" 

 Surreal memes often share the text-over-image format of the memes populating BuzzFeed listicles. Their subject matter, though, is entirely different. They can be about anything, really, but they’re always void of context and characterized by alarmingly nonsensical imagery, like a boy masquerading as a squid in space. They’re artistically discordant, like 2D static mixed with 3D renderings of random vectors and objects. They obliquely point to some commonality or absurdity of modern life, like failures of communication or the depersonalizing daily work grind. They make you question reality. They might feature the recurring character Meme Man, whose glossy Voldemortian head is balder than bald, or Mr. Orange, a digital illustration of an orange with reptilian limbs and a thousand-yard stare.

Surreal memes “may be difficult to understand for mere mortals,” the subreddit’s sidebar reads. “T R A N S C E N D,” it urges. Surreal memes whisper to me, ASMR-style, “Escape reality in our unreality.”

/r/MuscleConfusion is a Gif / Video based subreddit dedicated to those people who have a funny and unconventional way to doing an exercise. As a long time lifter I've spent a lot of time in the gym and have experienced a ton of different things but there is nothing like seeing that one person who's most likely new to lifting and just doing something absurd with the machine/weights/cardio equipment.

When I found this subreddit I knew It had to be featured because this sub needs to be bigger, the posts are absolutely hilarious. I fell into a wormhole of these posts and woke up 3 hours later with my face sore from smiling. Regardless of if you work out or have never touched a weight I believe you should check this out because its just a good time. They have a rule of no posting gifs of people that get hurt doing these exercises so you don't have to worry about feeling bad for these people its all in good fun. I mean [c'mon you can't tell me this isn't absurd](https://g.redditmedia.com/SDG5rfn1vK45-T9Hx7g2kG-UaVDjU2rQsbJxTAxs4l8.gif?fm=mp4&mp4-fragmented=false&s=06d2f50872ae5d310dd5dce44b715986), haha. 

But I have to say I'd still rather see people do this than take the mid workout selfie, Texting while sitting on the equipment, or coming in stupid and/or Inappropriate gym attire because at least this is more innocent I just wish more people would go up and let them know they aren't doing it correctly, But i'm guilty of just watching it happen in disbelief.

/r/DBZ is a subreddit dedicated to all things Dragon ball z!
Dragon Ball Z, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. It is the sequel to the Dragon Ball anime and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1988-1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 26, 1989 to January 31, 1996, before getting dubbed in territories including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, India, and Latin America. It was broadcast in at least 81 countries worldwide. It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.

Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of Goku who, along with his companions, defend the Earth against villains ranging from conquerors (Frieza), androids (Cell) and other creatures (Majin Buu). While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rivals Piccolo and Vegeta from enemies to allies.

Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially released by Viz Media under the title Dragon Ball Z. Additional works called animanga were released in Japan, which adapt the animation to manga form. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous releases which have come to represent the majority of content in the Dragon Ball universe; including 17 movies and 148 video games, many of them being only released in Japan, and a host of soundtracks stemming from this material. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural icon through numerous adaptations, including a more-recent remastered broadcast titled Dragon Ball Kai.[a] There have also been two sequel series; Dragon Ball GT (1996–1997) and Dragon Ball Super (2015–2018).

 /r/Firefly is dedicated to the TV show Firefly an American space western drama television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon. The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a ""Firefly-class"" spaceship.

The show explores the lives of a group of people, some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war, who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the pioneer culture of their star system. In this future, the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures. According to Whedon's vision, ""nothing will change in the future: technology will advance, but we will still have the same political, moral, and ethical problems as today"".

Firefly premiered in the U.S. on the Fox network on September 20, 2002. By mid-December, Firefly had averaged 4.7 million viewers per episode and was 98th in Nielsen ratings.[3] It was canceled after eleven of the fourteen produced episodes were aired. Despite the relatively short life span of the series, it received strong sales when it was released on DVD and has large fan support campaigns. It won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2003 for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. TV Guide ranked the series at No. 5 on their 2013 list of 60 shows that were ""Cancelled Too Soon"".

The post-airing success of the show led Whedon and Universal Pictures to produce Serenity, a 2005 film which continues from the story of the series,[4] and the Firefly franchise expanded to other media, including comics and a role-playing game.

Naruto (ナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, an adolescent ninja who searches for recognition from his peers and the village and also dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is in two parts, the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on Cartoon Network from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, and then switched to Adult Swim's Toonami block in January 2014. Besides the anime series, Studio Pierrot has developed eleven movies and eleven original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

Naruto is the third best-selling manga series in history, selling 235 million copies worldwide in 35 countries. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

/r/EDM is a subreddit dedicated to the music called Electronic Dance Music! Here you can discuss all things EDM, share music, and discus news..etc

Electronic dance music (EDM), also known as dance music, club music, or simply dance, is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves and festivals. It is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music', or simply 'dance'.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of raving, pirate radios and an upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM achieved widespread mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time, acceptance of dance culture was not universal; although both electro and Chicago house music were influential both in Europe and the United States, mainstream media outlets and the record industry remained openly hostile to it. There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture, which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.

Subsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, largely in Australia and the United States. By the early 2010s, the term ""electronic dance music"" and the initialism ""EDM"" was being pushed by the American music industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including house, techno, trance, drum and bass and dubstep, as well as their respective subgenres

Welcome to the Star Wars Expanded Universe subreddit! We are primarily a source of discussion and news surrounding the Star Wars LEGENDS and STORY GROUP CANON Expanded Universe Stories.
Star Wars expanded to other media includes all Star Wars fictional material produced by Lucasfilm or officially licensed by it outside of the original Star Wars films and television series. Intended as an enhancement to and extension of the theatrical films produced by George Lucas, the spin-off material was moderated by Lucasfilm, and Lucas reserved the right to both draw from and contradict it in his own works. This includes an array of derivative Star Wars works produced in conjunction with, between, and after the original trilogy (1977–1983), prequel trilogy (1999–2005), and sequel trilogy (2015–2019) of films, and includes books, comic books, video games, and television series.

Material produced prior to 2014 were known as the Star Wars Expanded Universe (SWEU or EU), later rebranded to Star Wars Legends, with the exception of the 2008 The Clone Wars animated film and TV series (not to be confused with the 2003 cartoon series Clone Wars), and with most works produced after 2014 part of the official canon as defined by Lucasfilm. 
Although the Star Wars film series itself has never been rebooted, a decision was made, due to works set after the original trilogy that contradict and deviate from Lucas' own view of the Star Wars story, to discard the EU works from the franchise canon. Lucas decided to cease creative involvement after selling, in October 2012, the Star Wars franchise as well as Lucasfilm (the production company of Star Wars) to The Walt Disney Company. When Disney began development of a sequel trilogy of films and other works, and needed its films to have full creative freedom unbound by the EU, nearly all EU works were removed from Star Wars franchise canon and rebranded as Star Wars Legends. (The two 2008 EU works which remained in canon were Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated film and its TV series.)

Most of the non-film works produced after April 2014 are part of the official Lucasfilm canon. 




If you want to get into Legends, Canon, or both or want to learn more about the Expanded Universe in general, you can find a few links in the sidebar that may be helpful. Feel free to ask the community as well!

The first two Rocksteady games were written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini and featured voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, respectively, from the DC Animated Universe (DCAU). Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill returned to voice Batman and The Joker again in the fourth main installment of the series, Batman: Arkham Knight. Other actors in the series to reprise their roles from the DCAU include Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn (in Batman: Arkham Asylum), as well as C.C.H.

Black Mirror is an anthology series created by Charlie Brooker featuring speculative fiction with dark and sometimes satirical themes which examine modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. On here you can discus and speculate about the episodes they have all the episode discussion threads on the side bar!


Black Mirror was inspired by older anthology series like The Twilight Zone, which were able to deal with controversial, contemporary topics without fear of censorship. Brooker developed Black Mirror to highlight topics related to humanity's relationship to technology, creating stories that feature ""the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.""

The series premiered for two series on the British television channel Channel 4 in December 2011 and February 2013, respectively. After its addition to the catalogue in December 2014, Netflix purchased the programme in September 2015. It commissioned a series of 12 episodes later divided into the third and fourth series, each six episodes; the former was released on 21 October 2016 and the latter on 29 December 2017. A fifth series was announced on 5 March 2018. A standalone interactive film titled Black Mirror: Bandersnatch was released on 28 December 2018.

The series has garnered positive reception from critics, received many awards and nominations, and seen an increase in interest internationally, particularly in the United States after its addition to Netflix. Two episodes, ""San Junipero"" (from the third series) and ""USS Callister"" (fourth series), won a total of six Emmy Awards, with both episodes winning Outstanding Television Movie.

This is a subreddit for the fans of Guillermo del Toro. If you're a fan of his sci-fi, horror, and fantasy films and tv-series, we welcome you!

Just don't eat the food.

Guillermo del Toro Gómez  is a Mexican filmmaker, director, screenwriter, producer, author, actor and former special effects makeup artist. He is best known for the Academy Award-winning fantasy films Pan's Labyrinth (2006) and The Shape of Water (2017), winning the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Picture for the latter.

Throughout his career, del Toro has shifted between Spanish-language horror-fantasy films, such as Cronos (1993) and The Devil's Backbone (2001), and more mainstream American sci-fi-action films, including Mimic (1997), Blade II (2002), Hellboy (2004), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), and Pacific Rim (2013). He also directed the gothic romance film Crimson Peak (2015). As a producer, he worked on the films The Orphanage (2007), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), The Hobbit film series (2012–14), Mama (2013), The Book of Life (2014), and Pacific Rim Uprising (2018). 
 
Del Toro's work has been characterized by a strong connection to fairy tales and horror, with an effort to infuse visual or poetic beauty in the grotesque. He has had a lifelong fascination with monsters, which he considers symbols of great power. He is also known for his use of insectile and religious imagery, the themes of Catholicism and celebrating imperfection, underworld and clockwork motifs, practical special effects, dominant amber lighting and his frequent collaborations with actors Ron Perlman and Doug Jones. He is good friends with fellow Mexican filmmakers Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro G. Iñárritu, collectively known as ""The Three Amigos of Cinema!

 /r/Steak is for all things STEAK related. Pics, recipes, hints and tips, articles, anything about tasty cuts of beef cooked to perfection!

 If you’re not a vegetarian (with all due respect), we have a feeling that you’re a fan of steak. And why not? You should be. A hunk of beef, cut into a perfect portion, seasoned, and seared on a ripping hot grill or a cast-iron pan is one of the most delicious things you’ll ever eat. Beef tastes good. It’s as simple as that. Our brains have been hard-wired over the course of thousands of years to enjoy the taste of beef, so we do.
Regardless of what cut is your favorite whether its  Rib Eye Steak, T-Bone, Porterhouse, Filet Mignon, New York Strip, Prime Rib..etc This is the subreddit for you. 
 
When posting pictures, please also provide some information. Like what you've done or what you plan on doing to the steak.

PLEASE REMEMBER everyone likes their steak cooked differently. Medium steaks may be overcooked to some or undercooked to others. It's personal preference and it's all good!!

For some reason fans of movie trivia and the like are underrepresented on Reddit - /r/movies is too broad, /r/moviedetails is too niche, so we hope to provide a home for both casual and hardcore viewers to find interesting stuff they'd like to read about, be it for their favourite movies or things they've not yet seen.

**1,211,086** *pieces of trash* for **6 years!**
 
  
The term ""trashy"" can encompass a broad spectrum of walks of life. Trashy is basically not giving a fuck. Breaking social conventions, ignoring social propriety, and being proud of it (or otherwise ignorant of it). The subjects of /r/Trashy all have this in common, and with the added of bonus of doing it publicly enough to leave behind evidence to post to the internet. The content of r/Trashy is interesting (at least to me) because it's fun to see people do their own thing and give legit zero fucks what other people think. Trashy transcends age, race, appearance, socioeconomic status, etc. This sub is filled with posts of people confidently violating social conventions. 

/r/Trashy's intention is not to evoke a sense of disgust or negative reaction. Being trashy is not cringe worthy, and being cringe worthy is generally not trashy. There is a fine line at times. This subreddit is extremely interesting because it gives the reader a glimpse into a lifestyle that they may not necessarily be familiar with or engage in. It is also a place to celebrate those who choose to break cultural rules. One point that should be made clear on is that /r/trashy doesn't make fun of these people who live outside of society's rules. It celebrates them. 

While a subreddit like this tends to be a place that would draw a lot of negative energy and sentiment the moderators at /r/trashy make it a priority to try to keep the quality of life as high as they can with their number 1 rule which is.
 
*  Excessively derogatory comments unrelated to TrashTM are not allowed.
*  Bullying is not allowed.
*  Toxic behavior of any kind is banned.
*  To extend the rule above, heated ""social justice"" wars are not allowed on this subreddit. This rule encompasses the following hot-button topics: gender, trans*, rape, child support and alimony, race, ""cultural marxism"", slut shaming, fat positivity, Men's Rights, feminism, and anything related. If you feel the need to climb onto the soapbox about one of these issues, find one of the dozens of threads that pop up about it on every large sub, every day. You are not going to enact social change by having an impassioned discussion on a sub that champions people pissing in public. Respectful threads on these issues will be tolerated.
*  No witch hunts.
*  Do not direct link any personal information or social media profiles

r/wishyouwerehere is a sub dedicated to the relaxing vibe of chilling by a campfire, reading a book in a rustic a-frame cabin, or a feeling of insignificance when you are in an area rife with beauty and grandeur. I named it Wish you were here for the feeling I hope to invoke while browsing my content, or more specifically a feeling of Wanderlust. It's also different from other nature subs in that you can share your own personal travel journals if you'd like in any format (I don't have any sort of template to use yet) and the focus might not always be on the place itself, but what is happening in the photo or gif. Something as mundane as a cup of coffee with a mountain backdrop is perfect for r/wishyouwerehere! [This is one of my favorite coffee gifs](https://gfycat.com/UnselfishDefinitiveHochstettersfrog) 

Who wouldn't want to sip on a cup of java in this wonderful place? Do you feel a strong urge to visit this place? I hope so, because the feeling I get while looking at this type of content, is what I want my subscribers to feel. This is one of my favorite photos because it triggers my nostalgia even though I've never been here, and the title aptly describes how I feel when I look at it. The camping content further distinguishes this sub from other beauty based subs, and this picture exemplifies what this sub is about! There is so much good content out there for this sub I am excited to see where it goes!

 Interested in programming? Like to read about programming without seeing a constant flow of technology and political news into your proggit? That's what /r/coding is for. A pure discussion of programming with a strict policy of programming-related discussions. 
As a general policy, if your article doesn't have a few lines of code in it, it probably doesn't belong here. However, things directly related to the actual process of programming - libraries, tools, and so on - are all okay, but please use discretion.

For those who don't know Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding. The source code of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. 

Related programming tasks include testing, debugging, maintaining a program's source code, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.

This is a subreddit dedicated to Gunnm (銃夢 Ganmu, literally ""gun dream""), also known as Battle Angel Alita in its English translated versions, is a Japanese cyberpunk manga series created by Yukito Kishiro and originally published in Shueisha's Business Jump magazine from 1990 to 1995. The first two of the comic's nine volumes were adapted into a two-part anime original video animation in 1993 titled Battle Angel for North American release by ADV Films and the UK and Australian release by Manga Entertainment. Manga Entertainment also dubbed Battle Angel Alita into English. A live-action film adaptation titled Alita: Battle Angel was released on February 14, 2019. 

The series is set in the post-apocalyptic future and focuses on Alita, a female cyborg who has lost all memories and is found in a junkyard by a cybernetics doctor who rebuilds and takes care of her. She discovers that there is one thing she remembers, the legendary cyborg martial art Panzer Kunst, which leads to her becoming a Hunter Warrior or bounty hunter. The story traces Alita's attempts to rediscover her past and the characters whose lives she impacts on her journey. The manga series is continued in Battle Angel Alita: Last Order and Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicle. 

On /r/Gunnm posts about both the movie and the manga are allowed. Discussions and other posting encouraged! This is an amazing subreddit with an extremely welcoming community whether you're a die hard fan of the Manga or a new fan like me from the film this is the sub for you!

 This is a community for James Cameron's Alita: Battle Angel, coming out on February 14, 2019. Discussion about Gunnm/Battle Angel Alita (銃夢), the manga on which the movie is based on, is more than welcome! 

Alita: Battle Angel is a 2019 American cyberpunk action film based on the 1990s Japanese manga series Gunnm (also known as Battle Angel Alita) by Yukito Kishiro. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, the film is written by James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis, and produced by Cameron and Jon Landau. Rosa Salazar stars as the titular Alita, a cyborg who sets out to learn about her past after she awakens in a new body with no memory of who she is. Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson also star in supporting roles. 

I remember the first time I saw the trailer I was so intrigued, while everyone else was complaining about the eyes I was excited to see how it would turn out. Seeing the film was an amazing experience the feeling of truly enjoying a film and falling inlove with the characters is such a joy. Since my first showing I've dived deep into the manga and tried to find a community where I could discuss this. I found it with /r/AlitaBattleAngel!  

Come check it out and please go see Alita while it's still in theaters near you!

**1,708** *Superbike Riders* for **7 Years!**

/r/wsbk is a subreddit all about the World Superbike Championship, the premier series of Superbike championships. From humble beginnings. This year we have many changes in the series with adding another race you can get up to date with all the going ons below and in the side bar of our subreddit.

Alongside established names of the category, many are the emerging figures that will debut in the new campaign, which will begin on February 23-24 at Phillip Island.

[Jonathan Rea](https://twitter.com/jonathanrea) will defend his 2018 victory as well as hunting his fifth back to back title and with that another new astonishing record. As always, the Northern Irishman will ride with the [Kawasaki Racing WorldSBK Team](https://twitter.com/KRT_WorldSBK), alongside new teammate [Leon Haslam](https://twitter.com/realleonhaslam) who had already competed in WorldSBK in the past, who in 2018 won the British Superbikes Championship.

A new duo will form the lineup for the [Aruba.it Racing – Ducati team](https://twitter.com/ArubaRacing). Sharing the garage with consolidated [Chaz Davies](https://twitter.com/chazdavies7), there will be Spanish [Alvaro Bautista](https://twitter.com/19Bautista), who will debut in the premier class aboard the all-new Ducati Panigale V4R after an extensive career spent in the MotoGP paddock.

[Alex Lowes](https://twitter.com/alexlowes22) and [Michael van der Mark](https://twitter.com/mickeyvdmark) will continue to ride for the [Pata Yamaha Official WorldSBK team](https://twitter.com/PataYamahaWSBK). Other two factory supported Yamaha bikes will be added to the grid with newly crowned 2018 WorldSSP Champion [Sandro Cortese](https://twitter.com/Sandrissimo11) and Italian star 

[Marco Melandri](https://twitter.com/MarcoMelandri33) riding aboard the two bikes run by the new [GRT Yamaha WorldSBK Team](https://twitter.com/grtyamahawsbk).

Also 2018 STK1000 Champion [Markus Reiterberger](https://twitter.com/MReiterberger28) will move over to WorldSBK, forming a duo with [Tom Sykes](https://twitter.com/TheRealTomSykes) in the new partnership between [Shaun Muir Racing and BWM Motorrad WorldSBK](https://twitter.com/SMRWorldSBK).

2019 will see the comeback of another illustrious name as Japanese [Ryuichi Kiyonari](https://twitter.com/kiyonariryuichi) will join the new Honda Corporate supported [Moriwaki – Althea HONDA Racing team](https://twitter.com/HondaWSBK) alongside [Leon Camier](https://twitter.com/leoncamier).

Another new Honda rider is Italian Alessandro Del Bianco - [Althea MIE Racing Team](https://twitter.com/AltheaRacing) who will debut in WorldSBK at the age of only 21.

Independent Kawasaki riders Leandro Mercado (Orelac VerdNatura) and [Toprak Razgatlioglu](https://twitter.com/toprak_tr54) - Turkish Puccetti Racing will stick with their 2018 teams while [Jordi Torres](https://twitter.com/jorditorres81) will compete with the ZX-10RR of Team Pedercini Racing.

[Michael Ruben Rinaldi](https://twitter.com/michaelrinaldi_) will race full-time in the top category with the Ducati of the Barni Racing Team, while [Eugene Laverty](https://twitter.com/eugenelaverty) will be in the saddle of Team GoEleven’s new Panigale V4R.

One of the most exciting developments of the 2019 pre-season has been the announcement that both Honda and BMW will compete in the MOTUL FIM Superbike World Championship with factory-backed teams, joining Kawasaki, Ducati and Yamaha on the grid next season. All five are due to face off for the first time at Phillip Island, and taking their past successes into account all cards will be off the table. Let’s take a look at the high points in WorldSBK of the five marques that will do battle for the title next season.

BMW: The German giant has only been fully involved in WorldSBK one time in the past, a successful five-year spell from 2009 to 2013 that saw them compete for WorldSBK’s top prizes. After three years of bringing the bike up to speed with Troy Corser, Ruben Xaus (2009-2010) and Leon Haslam (2011), BMW Motorrad’s big break came in 2012 with Marco Melandri who managed six race wins and third position in the championship standings, with teammate Haslam adding several podiums more to the team’s name. BMW was second in the manufacturers standings, just missing out on the top prize.

Melandri received a new teammate in 2013 in the form of Chaz Davies, and both men finished the season with three wins apiece and inside the top five. That was the last official BMW partnership to compete in WorldSBK – Tom Sykes and Markus Reiterberger will pick up the baton with gold in their sights.

Ducati: How does one choose a single moment for the most successful manufacturer in WorldSBK history? The Italian marque has managed – be it through factory or private teams – 17 riders championships, 17 constructor’s titles, 341 race wins, 890 podium finishes… All of that, with a nearly uninterrupted presence in the World Superbike paddock.
The highlight of this unparalleled journey would perhaps be the 13 manufacturers titles that the Borgo Panigale marque won between 1991 and 2004 – with a runner-up spot in 1997 to complete the near-perfect run. During that time, six world champions were crowned on Ducati twins: Doug Polen, Troy Corser, Troy Bayliss, Neil Hodgson, James Toseland and, of course, Carl Fogarty. And it all started with Polen’s magical season of 1991: 17 wins and 4 second positions in 24 races.

Honda: Ducati’s big rival since the birth of World Superbike, the Japanese manufacturer left its bikes in private hands from the 2003 season forwards. Before that, HRC competed several seasons in the class with incredible success: John Kocinski achieved their first factory-supported title in 1997.
Another American hero in Colin Edwards extended their achievements into the new millennium, sealing the title in 2000 and 2002. And while his efforts were not officially supported by Honda, James Toseland’s epic 2007 title win with the Ten Kate Honda team merits its share of plaudits.

Kawasaki: The green machines have been the undisputed kings of World Superbike in the past five years, which has also been their most successful spell in the series. Titles in 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 – together with the manufacturers crown in the last four seasons – have confirmed them as the top dogs of WorldSBK, with Tom Sykes and particularly Jonathan Rea the men to beat this decade.

But these are by no means Kawasaki’s entire history in WorldSBK: during the 1990s, motorbikes made by the Japanese titan kickstarted the careers of several WorldSBK stars, including Akira Yanagawa, Anthony Gobert, Aaron Slight or 1993 World Champion Scott Russell (their first title in WorldSBK).

Yamaha: The third and final Japanese manufacturer on this list and a reliable marque in the world of motorcycling racing, Yamaha machinery has had recent success at all levels of WorldSBK, most recently with the three race wins achieved by Michael van der Mark and Alex Lowes last seasons.

Yamaha reached their peak performance in WorldSBK in the late 2000s. Noriyuki Haga missed out on the world title in 2007 by just two points, but the combined efforts of the Japanese star and Troy Corser granted Yamaha their first manufacturers trophy. Haga was also on the losing end of a title battle in 2009, but this time it worked in Yamaha’s favour: Ben Spies roared ahead to their sole riders championship in WorldSBK by just six points.

Welcome to the KING KONG subreddit! A place for anything related to the Lovestruck Ape! From toys to movies, screenshots to trailers, everything from his feature film debut in 1933, the rumble in the jungle with Godzilla to Peter Jackon's 2005 remake! Anything and everything related to King Kong belongs here!

King Kong is a giant movie monster, resembling an enormous gorilla, that has appeared in various media since 1933. The character first appeared in the 1933 film King Kong from RKO Pictures, which received universal acclaim upon its initial release and re-releases. A sequel quickly followed that same year with The Son of Kong, featuring Little Kong. In the 1960s, Toho produced King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962), pitting a larger Kong against Toho's own Godzilla, and King Kong Escapes (1967), based on The King Kong Show (1966–1969) from Rankin/Bass Productions. In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis produced a modern remake of the original film directed by John Guillermin. A sequel, King Kong Lives, followed a decade later featuring a Lady Kong. Another remake of the original, this time set in 1933, was released in 2005 from filmmaker Peter Jackson.

The most recent film, Kong: Skull Island (2017), set in 1973, is part of Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse, which began with Legendary's reboot of Godzilla in 2014. A crossover sequel, Godzilla vs. Kong, once again pitting the characters against one another, is currently planned for 2020.

The character King Kong has become one of the world's most famous movie icons, having inspired a number of sequels, remakes, spin-offs, imitators, parodies, cartoons, books, comics, video games, theme park rides, and a stage play. His role in the different narratives varies, ranging from a rampaging monster to a tragic antihero.

/r/game is just as the name says, a game. In this case it's a bunch of puzzles, that's kind of similar to for example notpron, where you have to figure out the solution to a level before being able to move forward.


The game is played via collection of subreddits where you have to solve  the puzzle on each subreddit, before you will be added to the next level. With each level you'll encounter different style puzzles, that will also become harder as you get further into the game. The one hint we can give beforehand, is that most levels are best played through old.reddit.com since there are levels that will not work with the redesign.



Best thing to do is to just come over and start enjoying the puzzles laid out for you by the mod team, and feel free to join the [discord](https://discord.gg/dc983PV) as well, where you can ask for help/hints on each level.

""Platinum? Didn't think this post would get this much love!!""  

You see these all the time, especially on text-based subs such as /r/AskReddit and /r/AMA, and while the first couple of times you see ""thanks for the silver/gold/platinum, mysterious benefactor!"", you may not mind, but the resentment builds up over time.  

Until, you question:  
  
1. Why are people spending money on these people?  
2. Why are these edits a thing? Surely if someone liked your post/comment so much as to spend real life money to put a badge on it, you should keep it as it is?
  
/r/AwardSpeechEdits is a subreddit for screenshots of these cliche or unnecessary ""award speeches"" that redditors edit into their posts after they've become popular or gilded. Reddit is not the only sinner here, on YouTube (especially on kids' channels) you get ""omg thanks for the 1.4k likes"" edits, but combined with emojis. It truly is a travesty of the online medium.  
  
In the spirit of the sub, I won't waffle on or make this overly long, just that's the sub. If you like it, give it a sub.

**867** *readers* for **2 years!**

/r/Znyder is dedicated to the American film director, producer, and screenwriter, Zack Snyder. He made his feature film debut in 2004 with a remake of the 1978 horror film Dawn of the Dead. Since then, he has done a number of comic book and superhero films, including 300 (2006) and Watchmen (2009), as well as the Superman film that started the DC Extended Universe, Man of Steel (2013) and its follow-ups, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017). He also served as co-screenwriter for 300, Sucker Punch (2011), and 300: Rise of an Empire (2014), and as co-writer of the story for Wonder Woman (2017) and Justice League.

Snyder is the co-founder of Cruel and Unusual Films, a production company he established in 2004, alongside his wife Deborah Snyder and producing partner Wesley Coller. He recently announced his New Production Company the Stone Quarry!

""New Year. New Identity. After 14 amazing years making groundbreaking entertainment under the Cruel & Unusual Films Moniker, we're excited to unveil our new company identity as we move into 2019 and beyond,"" he said in his statement. ""Although Cruel & Unusual Films will always be a proud part of our legacy, our new and exciting future creative endeavors will be mined, chiseled and honed in THE STONE QUARRY""

An extremely divisive director, it seems like people either hate him or love him. I fall more into the love him side, he's one of my favorite directors I became a moderator on here because of how big of a fan I am. His films have had a huge impact on me whether it was from starting to work out because I was awestruck with *300* or being totally blown away by *Man of Steel* which lead me to find Reddit and find a community of people to connect with since my real life friends weren't as into this stuff as I was. 

Over at /r/Znyder we're hoping to build a passionate and strong community dedicated to discussing Zack's films past, present, and future. Whether you're a fan or not we'd like you to come in with an open mind and experience a visual feast.

**1706** citizens *wandering pantless* for **10 years!**  
  
Come closer, children. It is time for me to tell you an ancient legend. That legend is, the Legend of r/eddit. 

A long, long time ago, in a faraway land known as Pantopia, a ruthless king ruled over the people. The king was disliked by many because he had made the people do a terrible thing.... He had made the people wear pants! There were protests by the people, and many battles were fought, but to no avail. Until one day, a pantless legend came out of the shadows. His name - u/RLiamWilloughby. Liam faced the king in his throne room, and after a fight that lasted for 5 days, he was victorious. He became the mayor of the now renamed - **TOWN OF REDDIT** and introduced a law that made pants illegal in the town. The people were happy, and the rest is history.

Now, the town is growing rapidly. New citizens are moving to town [every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/eddit/comments/akwo42/i_live_here_now/), and the town council have gone as far as to set up their [own currency.](https://www.reddit.com/r/eddit/comments/akzdhj/bot_faq/) Anything is possible in this town, from building a huge MANTA ray to trying to become it's mayor. So if you wanna start fresh, maybe r/eddit is for you!
  
I conducted an interview with a couple of city council members, and one of the members happened to be - our resident writer, u/verifypassword__.

> #1. How did you discover r/eddit?

>> **u/verifypassword__** I'm sure I've stumbled across this sub a few times just out of boredom, but I found it after its pantsless renovation by stalking looking at the profiles of some people I used to mod with on another subreddit and just being like ""oh this looks cool"". After lurking on the sub for a bit, I was invited by RPG_Ivan (fellow SubredditOfTheDay mod and all-round cool guy) to mod this sub! ^(and the rest is history)

>> **u/RyMCon3** I misspelled Reddit once, idek how but i came right upon mayor Willoughby's thingy and I was like heeellllll yeah,and from there my character has become a furfucker and librarian. Id like to say that's not me irl, just in r/eddit. And occasionally when browsing other subs I accidentally stay in character... Killing a little bit of my karma, oh well.

> #2. What is r/eddit all about?

>> **u/verifypassword__** This sub is about what you make it. Would you like to get married to a fellow Redditor? We've already got the venue booked to make you r/eddit official. Have a hunch communism could work on this sub? Join the communist revolution! Want to overthrow the mayor? Well, sure you can try. Just want to make an honest living by selling ice? Go ahead!

>> **u/RyMCon3** It's about being an insane wierdo and being a different character inside of this world, separate from the real one. It's a world where you can be anything but hateful and that's kinda magical. Really it's like if you can imagine it, it's a reality. A fake reality but a reality nonetheless. Also i think that's an oxymoron.

> #3. Why should fellow Redditors join r/eddit?

>> **u/verifypassword__** You should join because you can start fresh and reinvent yourself as anything you want to be. Here's an example: outside this sub, you could be the most [notorious reposter](https://www.reddit.com/u/GallowBoob), for example, but when you come to this town, we don't mind - you can become a master of OC. Truly anything is possible in this town.

**32,501** suspicious townies for **4** years!

**/u/Umbresp was brutally murdered last night.**

**He died of guilt from procrastinating on his SROTD features. He was also stabbed by /u/seth1299.**

**We found a will next to his body.**

Town of Salem is a pay-to-play multiplayer strategy game. Released in late 2014 by developer BlankMediaGames, it is remembered as one of the relics of the late Adobe Flash era. Since its release, the game has spiked in popularity many times, received a Coven expansion, been ported to Steam, and more recently, become pay-to-play. 

Town of Salem recently made headlines as news of a massive hack surfaced in late December of last year. Over 6 million usernames, emails, and MD5 hashes of passwords were stolen. It was later revealed that the information of supposedly deleted accounts were stolen as well, as the information was not actually deleted. 

Despite these alarmingly upsetting events, I have recently been playing Town of Salem religiously. Why, I ask, is the allure of this flash game so strong that I keep coming back to a game with many fatal security flaws left over as relics of 2014? (Editor's Note: When asked whether Umbresp hates the devs, he responded with [this picture](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/025/010/incredibles.jpg).)

Town of Salem is amazingly addicting. What should be a simple premise for a game (after all, it is based on Mafia) has evolved, throughout the years, into a complicated series of exception upon exception as new elements were introduced. 

In fact, the game's evolution has outpaced even the players. Part of the reason for Town of Salem's slow decline can be attributed to the shrinking playerbase. BMG has attempted to combat this by introducing a system where a player can invite a friend to a few games and get rewarded, but I think this is addressing the wrong problem.

The truth is, that Town of Salem is notoriously difficult to learn and get good at. A tutorial for the game is unheard of, and a disproportionate number of posts on /r/townofsalemgame are about stupid people players have met in their games. With all its elements, even an experienced player usually has to keep the wiki page open in a separate tab during a game.

That's why it's so fun.

Winning a game of Town of Salem feels way more elating than it probably should be. With all the brainpower required to keep track of what's going on, I would probably be better off in my life if I were to become a professional chess player. Besides, it's fun to call people savant zounderkites whenever they mess up. (Who, me? Never!)

And because of this skill cap, the community has developed within itself. There are a ton of ""customs"" present among the players. And just when you think you've uncovered them all, somebody says something you don't understand and you get to be one of the [lucky 10000](https://xkcd.com/1053/).

Does this sound familiar? To me, it does. It sounds ~~exactly~~ a lot like Reddit. We have it all- the in-jokes, the intellectuality, and the repeated bashing and r/woooosh-ing of people who don't get the reference. Which, I don't necessarily think is a bad thing. 

**We found a death note next to his body.**

Here's an exclusive interview with the moderators of /r/townofsalemgame.

> # 1. How did you start playing, and why?

>> **/u/DudWithACake** ToS has been one of my go-to's for 3 or 4 years now. A friend recommended it to me and I was hooked instantly.

>> **/u/ThePyroEagle** I was introduced to the game by an online friend, and enjoyed it to the point where I just kept on playing.

>> **/u/seth1299** I started playing after League of Legends youtuber Sky Williams (who recently took a 7 month sabbatical) uploaded [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS2JV5v68i8) of Town of Salem. Honestly, if the game was pay to play, I never would have paid $5.00 for it because my first few games I died the first night and it wasn’t fun at all. But since the game was free then, I started playing and learned more about the game from miscellaneous guides and other things.

> # 2. What do you think makes Town of Salem a great and unique game?

>> **/u/DudWithACake** I've always loved social deduction games. Being that they require so many players makes it hard to play them often IRL. That's why I play ToS. I enjoy the aspect that every player gets a role, most social deduction games have a lot of ""generic good guy"" or ""generic bad guy"". Everyone getting abilities makes it much more fun.

>> **/u/ThePyroEagle** The game is entirely focused on deception. As a result of this, there is no set way of winning, and strategy is based entirely around information. In most strategy games, it's very easy to understand how much information your opponents have based on the rules. In this case, the only clues you get are information you collect yourself and actions other players take based on their own information.

>> **/u/seth1299** I think that what sets Town of Salem apart from other games is its mystery factor. Other games like Fortnite, Overwatch, Black Ops, once you learn how to play, you pretty much just do the same thing over and over again. Kill, capture points, kill, capture points, repeat. In Town Of Salem, you’re almost never the same role twice and the same strategy over and over again will just lead to people who have played with you recognizing that you’re doing the same thing (the playerbase isn’t that large) and then will respond accordingly (if you’re a Serial Killer claiming Doctor like you just did last game, they’ll probably not believe you and/or try to lynch you).

> # 3. What is your favorite role to play as?

>> **/u/DudWithACake** Transporter. It has such a high skill ceiling. You can protect the town, kill bad guys, confirm yourself to people to force them to talk, and a TON more. Also, it's one of the few roles where you can mind game. ""Will they attack Giles? But will they know I think they'll attack Giles?"" Those situations are some of the most fun for me.

>> *The mechanic of Transporter is that he swaps two people every night, and people who targeted Person A will hit Person B and vice versa.*

>> **/u/ThePyroEagle** Definitely Jester.

>> *The mechanic of Jester is to act suspicious and get yourself lynched in order to win.*

>> **/u/seth1299** My favorite role to play as is the Hex Master. If I don’t die, it’s simply beautiful to kill 7 people at once while also permanently framing each one as I mark them for death. I like this role better than Arsonist because you have a team and don’t need to take another night to ignite, your hex just goes off automatically.

>> *Hex Master is a high risk, high reward investment. You can hex one person each night, and if you are still alive while all the living players are hexed, they will all be attacked automatically.*

> # 4. What is your opinion on the community?

>> **/u/DudWithACake** Our subreddit's community is crazy fun. The creativity and lengths people go for meme-ing the game always amazes me.

>> **/u/ThePyroEagle** On reddit, the community is very nice. Most of the memes and flummeryposts* that get posted to the subreddit are creative and funny. The community also gets serious when it matters. Overall, I'd say that the reddit community is fun, and toxicity is very rare.

>> \* Our word for ""shitpost"" as ""shit"" is replaced with ""flummery"" by the game's chat filter.

>> **/u/seth1299** The community is... normal. They aren’t necessarily toxic anymore than your average videogame player is and a lot of them have good ideas to help the community out as a whole. I do wish they would have better reading literacy though[.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/449/773/38b.png)

> # 5. What is your opinion on BMG and the recent changes to the game they've introduced?

>> **/u/DudWithACake** I'm excited for what BMG is planning in the future. The Unity port for desktop clients will make the game so much smoother. For recent changes, I was surprised by switching to Pay to Play. But I think they handles it incredibly well by having a way to refer friends so they can still try before playing.

>> **/u/ThePyroEagle** My opinion is fairly neutral: they're a company, and they strive for a profit. They have made mistakes, but recently, they've been working with the community to fix them. Making the game P2P (Pay to Play) was a necessary change to remove bots, but I'm glad they've finally took final measures to solve the bot problem, even if it decreases the number of new players. Unfortunately, BMG has been a bit inactive on reddit, likely due to the toxicity and hostility caused by bots (which I'd hope to think has since been cleared up), though their activity is something I'd like to help restore.

>> **/u/seth1299** I feel negative towards BMG for just giving us the cold shoulder after all we did to try and help them. They never even told us they left the subreddit. They also make decisions before consulting the community as a whole first. Sometimes they have reason, like they obviously didn’t want to warn bot makers that “hey you can’t make new accounts after this date or else you’ll need to pay $5.00 each”. The bot makers would have just stockpiled up accounts. But other times, the changes just come from nowhere. Such as instantly banning people for copying and pasting a message multiple times, such as their will. Sure spamming is dumb, but a permanent ban? Really? As for the recent changes, I do agree with them for the most part. Making the game pay-to-play was a necessary step in order to stop the constant bots. The new refer-a-friend system is a pretty decent step forward, but not perfect. If I had made the system, I would have included a warning message that said: “Are you SURE you want to refer username placeholder? If they get banned, your account will also be banned.” As of now, unless people actually read the forums or stickied post, they won’t know that the code-lender account will be banned if the trial account gets banned. People still don’t know that the game became pay-to-play to this day, and it’s been stickied to the top of the sub for almost a month now with over 3,000 views. I doubt they’ll have any idea that their account is 100% liable for anything the trial account does for at least another 2 months.

Right, okay. So...
Memeulous (real name Mr. George Meme/Fabulous) is a British YouTuber known for his commentary videos. In late 2017 he hit a million subscribers, in mid-2018 he hit 2 million, and early this year he hit 3 million! But, in my humble opinion, Memeulous hit his peak in February when he announced on Twitter that [he's got a subreddit now](https://twitter.com/Memeulous/status/1094314214561325057).  
  
/r/Memeulous is a hub for all things Memeulous-related and not Memeulous-related. The immediate inside-jokes from the channel also on the subreddit include jokes about his roommate drinking bath water (which is 100% true), whether or not he is a nonce (he's not) and jokes about Memeulous' height ([he's apparently under 5 foot 8](https://youtu.be/qZbIeTZpar8?t=59)).  

But after a while, the /r/Memeulous community got bored of these same punchlines. The subreddit began to devolve into meta jokes about [Instagram reposts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Memeulous/comments/ar8iud/fact/) and [the lack of original content](https://www.reddit.com/r/Memeulous/comments/ark9x8/its_true/).  

And now, for some reason, the subreddit has become about [cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Memeulous/comments/atzvev/this_sub_is_allowing_anything_at_this_point_so/). There are still some dedicated Memeulous posters (for example /u/Finnulous) but like all edgy teenagers, the subreddit is currently going through a phase.  
  
Subscribe! If you like Memeulous, that is. Or even if you don't - who knows where the subreddit could go next? Could [Memeulous' potential future video looking at some of the posts](https://twitter.com/Memeulous/status/1094315736305188864) bring the subreddit back to its former Memeulous-related self? Join and become part of the subeddit's history.

Penpals come in all ages, nationalities, cultures, languages and interests. Pals may seek new penfriends based on their own age group, a specific occupation, hobby, or select someone totally different from them to gain knowledge about the world around them.  

While the expansion of the Internet has reduced the number of traditional penpals,  penpal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Some people are looking for romantic interests, while others just want to find friends. It seems, on the internet, that the term ""pen pals"" defines those looking to correspond with others that live in a different place, where pen pals originated via postal mail correspondences and has evolved to mean something more.

/r/BackroundArt is a A place to share your favourite 2D background art. Submitted artwork must have been used within an animation or video game as a backdrop *(please specify if from a video game*).  

A background artist or sometimes called a background stylist or background painter is one who is involved in the process of animation who establishes the color, style, and mood of a scene drawn by an animation layout artist. The methods used can either be through traditional painting or by digital media such as Adobe Photoshop. Traditional methods involved painting entire production scenes for a television program or film. Current methods may involve painting primarily background keys or the establishing shot while production background artists paint the corresponding background paintings.

Some fields in which a Background Artist may work:Motion pictures,Television,Video games,The Internet

Other artists who contribute to animated cartoons, but who are not Background Artists, are layout artists (who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles), storyboard artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), character designers (who create the style and personality of each character).

In Japanese animation, the cast member credited as the Art Director (美術監督, bijutsu kantoku) usually refers to the sole background artist (for smaller productions) or director in charge of background art creation. 

[Here is a Guide: capturing animation backgrounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/BackgroundArt/wiki/guide)

Welcome, /r/Animation is a subreddit dedicated to all things Animation. Whether it be news like [the unfortunate passing of ‘SpongeBob Squarepants’ Creator Stephen Hillenburg](https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/a0xfyc/spongebob_squarepants_creator_stephen_hillenburg/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=animation),[ Sharing your art](https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/8iygzk/trying_something_new_making_lip_states_in_a/), [critiquing](https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/95z1d2/i_had_a_go_at_animating_my_own_simpsons_couch_gag/)...etc this is the place for you [if you're interested in this medium in any way](https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/9eby6j/one_of_the_best_intro_ive_ever_seen_in_2013/).

Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets or clay figures.

Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement, but the exact causes are still uncertain. Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope and film. Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. For display on the computer, techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.

Apart from short films, feature films, animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display moving images, animation is also heavily used for video games, motion graphics and special effects.

The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics in for instance the moving images in magic lantern shows can also be considered animation. Mechanical animation of actual robotic devices is known as animatronics.

Animators are artists who specialize in creating animation.

/r/3Dmodeling is a place to show people your 3d models, whether it be 3d studio max, Blender, Maya, Zbrush, Rhino, Alias, any type of 3d models really.

Links to different articles and videos about 3d modeling are highly encouraged, whether it be a great cgi film or an article on new rendering software.
Feel free to post questions or opinions on anything that has to do with 3d modeling. The point is to have a place where we can help each other out. 

In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any surface of an object (either inanimate or living) in three dimensions via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. Someone who works with 3D models may be referred to as a 3D artist. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.

Models may be created automatically or manually. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. 3D modeling software is a class of 3D computer graphics software used to produce 3D models. Individual programs of this class are called modeling applications or modelers. This is a subreddit dedicated to shocasing the work these many artists have spend hours of their lives on!

Welcome to /r/Cinema4D! In this subreddit you can submit all things related to Cinema 4D, your own creations, resources and questions, but also related (news) articles. Cinema 4D (stylised as CINEMA 4D) is a 3D modeling, animation, motion graphic and rendering application developed by MAXON Computer GmbH in Germany. It is capable of procedural and polygonal/subd modeling, animating, lighting, texturing, rendering, and common features found in 3D modelling applications. 

Initially, Cinema 4D was developed for Amiga computers in the early 1990s, and the first three versions of the program were available exclusively for that platform. With v4, however, MAXON began to develop the program for Windows and Macintosh computers as well, citing the wish to reach a wider audience and the growing instability of the Amiga market following Commodore's bankruptcy. 

#Starting out with Cinema 4D
 
Learning any 3D software can be a daunting task, so often people would like advice on where to start. Here we've listed a few resources that will get you up to speed in no-time.

/r/AmItheAsshole is the sub to lay out your actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you. Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations.

After 24 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter. This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best. **The power of the crowd will judge you.**

Boasting an extremely hard working group of moderators who work hard to keep the subreddit thriving, and a captivating array of posts I highly recommend this subreddit! If you post on this sub, and the discussion manages to change your perspective and motivate you to make amends, forgive an old friend, get forgiven, change your ways, ...or whatever, its more than worth your time!

**What qualifies as a story worth submitting?**

Submissions should be TRUTHFUL descriptions of recent conflicts you've had or may have. Describe the event and share it with us! It's important that you describe both sides in detail. Being neutral gets you more accurate feedback. Don't bother submitting humblebrag stories where there is no chance that you are the asshole, or awfulbrag stories where you are obviously being evil. Neither one is interesting.

We turn 5 this week, just in time for the speculation of 2020... which included a crosspost to an /r/politics AMA by Bernie’s account.

In 2016, we changed what internet activism looked like, and how Reddit could be used. We hope to continue that tradition and evolution in the next few years. As 2020 heats up, come join the community that recruited thousands of volunteers, registered even more, inspired unique creations and actions, led to new software, and raised millions of dollars for the man who has inspired millions and changed the direction of our national conversations.

 For the (ex-FOX) Netflix series ""Lucifer"". Based on characters created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg, this series follows Lucifer, the original fallen angel, who has become dissatisfied with his life in hell. After abandoning his throne and retiring to Los Angeles, Lucifer indulges in his favorite things (women, wine and song) -- until a murder takes place outside of his upscale nightclub. For the first time in billions of years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifer's soul that is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to wonder if there is hope for his soul.

 To all that come to this Happy place, Welcome!  /r/Disney is your subreddit. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. /r/Disney is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America.... With the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world!
The company was founded on October 16, 1923 by brothers Walt and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio; it also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before officially changing its name to The Walt Disney Company in 1986. The company established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. 

Since the 1980s, Disney has created and acquired corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands. The company is known for its film studio The Walt Disney Studios, which is one of the largest and best-known studios in American cinema. Disney's other main divisions are Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, Disney Media Networks, and Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International. Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, A&E Networks, and Freeform; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, a group of 14 theme parks around the world. The company has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1991. Mickey Mouse was created in 1928 and is the signature mascot and emblem for Disney and one of the world's most recognizable characters.

Disney has been one of the most constant staples in my life growing up watching the films, shows, going to Disneyland. It's truly something I cherish and appreciate that I still get to enjoy as an adult. This is a wonderful subreddit I implore you to visit!

The Witcher ), by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, is a fantasy series of short stories and novels about the witcher Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's books, ""witchers"" are monster hunters who (with training and body modification) develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle deadly beasts. The books have been adapted into a film, a television series, video games, and a graphic novel series. The series of novels is known as the Witcher Saga. The short stories and novels have been translated into numerous languages, including English.

The books have been described as having a cult following in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Bulgaria and other Central and Eastern European countries.

The video games have been very successful, and as of March 2018, they have sold over 33 million copies worldwide.

Trivium is an American heavy metal band from Orlando, Florida, formed in 1999. After getting signed to Roadrunner Records in 2004, the band has released eight studio albums and over twenty singles. Their latest album, The Sin and the Sentence, was released on October 20, 2017. The band has sold over one million albums worldwide.

Here on /r/Trivium you'll find everything you'll need for your fandom discussion posts, fanart, memes, covers, live videos..etc I remember having the album **Ascendancy** on repeat for hours in middle school just trying my hardest to learn the songs, I remember being so happy finally *a gunshot to the head of trepidation*. Ascendancy is by far my favorite album from them but it has been a great journey growing with them as they grow as musicians. They have been one of my most consistent listens over the last decade, shoot its been longer than a decade.. 

Nonetheless regardless of if you're a daily listener or someone who wants to find an artist to give metal a shot I highly recommend Trivium!

**191,152** gay Jar-Jars *pissing and shitting all over the place* for **10 months!**  
  
So.
  
""Gay Jar-Jars pissing and shitting all over the place.""  
  
I should probably explain that. It comes from [this meme from /r/ComedyCemetery](https://i.redd.it/zx481nqz4nm01.jpg), which is a picture of Jar Jar Binks with the caption ""I'm GAY and I PISS and SHIT all over the place."" Yeah, it's weird. It's stupid. It's crass. It's senseless. In fact, it's so weird, so stupid, so crass, that it enters the realm of being ironically funny.  
  
/r/ComedyHeaven is a subreddit created to chronicle memes like this - memes so unfunny that they shatter the boundaries of humour itself and become funny anyway.  
  
hey umm so  
here's an interview with the mods  
  
>##1. Why did you join the subreddit?   

>>**/u/CardboardPizzas** It all started with a certain gay Star Wars character who loved to piss and shit all over the place... [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedyCemetery/comments/85gmcz/came_across_this_hilarious_image_on_instagram/) was posted to r/ComedyCemetery, and a user commented: ""This is so stupid as fuck it causes a stack overflow into being funny."" The subreddit creator, /u/yung-forever, replied with ""r/comedyheaven"", as a joke. I replied to that with ""Should we create this? It'll be full of so-bad-they're-good memes like this. This shit is like The Room of memes."" I forgot all about it, but a little while later I recieved an invite to be a mod for r/comedyheaven from /u/yung-forever, and the rest is history!  
  
>>**/u/maple_shade** I also joined this subreddit from the comment chain where r/comedyheaven was first created. I became a mod after u/yung-forever posted a mod request and accepted my application.  
  
>>**/u/IdRatherBeEATINGASS** I was excited by this subreddit because I'd never found anyone who shared my absurd sense of humour before. I've also always wanted to be a moderator of a subreddit because I've seen a lot of injustice and silly moderation in other subreddits, and I feel the profession requires my superior rational skills.  
  
>>**/u/feajukg** I joined because poo poo is funny and epic.  
  
>##2. At what point do you think that something is so terrible that it becomes hilarious?  
  
>>**/u/maple_shade** Well, I think a lot of memes are intentionally terrible, which our sub isn't really for. To me, for a meme to be ""ascended,"" it needs to be so unfunny that you can't help laughing at the absurdity of it. Content like that is truly the paragon of comedyheaven material.  
  
>>**/u/IdRatherBeEATINGASS** It can be difficult to discern at times and there is always debate about what fits and what doesn't. Generally, it is something so aimless, inconsequential or contextually absurd that it makes you wonder why on earth the image exists in the first place.  
  
>>**/u/feajukg** For me, something becomes so bad that its good much like the way something becomes so realistic its scary - r/comedyheaven is the uncanny valley of comedy. You don't know *why* it's funny, because on the face of it, it's an abhorrent, revolting, squirming piece of filth.  
  
>>But it's still funny.  
  
>>**/u/CardboardPizzas** http://i.imgur.com/ibcrV7m.png  
  
>##3. What's your favourite shit meme on the subreddit?  
  
>>**/u/maple_shade** I'm always a fan of stupid comments. [The walter one](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/comments/9wiqqo/walter/) is a classic and had me dying laughing.  
  
>>**/u/IdRatherBeEATINGASS** [Bee removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/comments/9x6wja/bee_removal/) and [Gamer and Yeah](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/comments/8krgkk/yeah_im_gay/).  
  
>>**/u/feajukg** Either [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/comments/a1apfp/bea_n/) or [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/comments/9v8210/just_lookin/)  
  
>##4. Anything else you would like to add?
  
>>**/u/maple_shade** Moderating this sub is a very unique experience because truely ascended posts are very rare. It's interesting to try to keep content within the two extremes of r/okbuddyretard stuff and actually funny memes.

That's right only self owned, original pictures allowed.

That's one of my favorite things about this sub, in some photos you can really see the personality of the cat as well as the op themselves. It kind of humanizes these names we read on this forum in a way, if that makes any sense I find it really neat. Often there are some really awesome stories about the cat.Enough chit chat you came here for Cat pictures!


 
 
**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

The foremost collective for fans of one of the most acclaimed anime in the world, the Cowboy Bebop subreddit has been an active presence on reddit for 7 years, steadily growing a large community of like-minded lovers of the show. Recently, activity on the subreddit has exploded with the news of a brand new, live-action adaptation coming next year on Netflix.

After three subreddit-wide rewatches of the show with discussion threads, the breadth and depth of the show has proven to be endless, as there is always more to learn and appreciate. You also cannot find a friendlier, more supportive group of fans in the anime community.

This is not only the best place for Cowboy Bebop discussion, theories, deep analyses or finale reactions, but also the best place to share cosplays, fan art, memes, and more. Even if you have never watched Cowboy Bebop, you most likely have heard of it or at least watched the famous opening sequence. With the live-action remake looming on the horizon, there is no better time to watch the show and finally understand why the show is so universally praised.

  
>>**Cowboy Bebop** (カウボーイビバップ Kaubōi Bibappu) is a 1998 Japanese anime television series animated by Sunrise featuring a production team led by director Shinichirō Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane, and composer Yoko Kanno.The twenty-six episodes (""sessions"") of the series are set in the year 2071, and follow the lives of a bounty hunter crew traveling in their spaceship called the Bebop. Although it covers a wide range of genres throughout its run, Cowboy Bebop draws most heavily from western and noir films, and it's most recurring thematic focal points include adult existential ennui, loneliness and the difficulties of trying to escape one's past.

**Here is a taste of what you'll find when you visit!**

/r/lanadelrey is a subreddit dedicated to the American singer, songwriter, and record producer Lana Del Rey! Her music has been noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality, its preoccupation with themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.

Raised in Upstate New York, Del Rey moved to New York City in 2005 to embark on her music career. Following numerous projects including her debut studio album and the unreleased Sirens, Del Rey's breakthrough came after the viral success of her single ""Video Games"" in 2011.  She then signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major label debut Born to Die (2012) proved an international success and spawned her first top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 with the Cedric Gervais remix of ""Summertime Sadness"". Since, Del Rey has released the US Billboard 200 number-one albums Ultraviolence (2014) and Lust for Life (2017), along with top-ten releases Paradise (2012) and Honeymoon (2015). She has received nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for both Paradise and Lust for Life.
 

Dubbed by the media as the ""Queen of Indie Pop"", Del Rey has sold over 15 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Her official YouTube channel has accumulated over 3.1 billion views as of November 9, 2018, with 10 of her videos surpassing 100 million views on Vevo. 

On September 12, 2018, Del Rey released a new single titled ""Mariners Apartment Complex"". On September 18, she released the song ""Venice Bitch"", and announced the title of her sixth album to be Norman Fucking Rockwell, set to be released in early 2019. Del Rey premiered the track ""How to Disappear"", expected to feature on the album, at an Apple Music event on October 30, 2018.

With her new album coming soon I thought it would be perfect to feature this sub, here you will find discussion posts, photos, theories.etc

This is a place to chat, Discuss, and Explore everything related to Pixar! This is a free spirited bunch. Pixar Animation Studios, commonly referred to as Pixar, is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California, that is a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, owned by the Walt Disney Company. Pixar began in 1979 as the Graphics Group, part of the Lucasfilm computer division, before its spin-out as a corporation in 1986, with funding by Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, who became the majority shareholder. Disney purchased Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of $7.4 billion by converting each share of Pixar stock to 2.3 shares of Disney stock,  a transaction that resulted in Jobs becoming Disney's largest single shareholder at the time. Pixar is best known for CGI-animated feature films created with RenderMan, Pixar's own implementation of the industry-standard RenderMan image-rendering application programming interface, used to generate high-quality images. 


Pixar has produced 20 feature films, beginning with Toy Story (1995), which was the first-ever computer-animated feature film; its most recent film was Incredibles 2 (2018). All of the studio's films have debuted with CinemaScore ratings of at least an ""A−,"" indicating positive receptions with audiences.[6] The studio has also produced dozens of short films. As of August 2018, its feature films have earned approximately $13 billion at the worldwide box office, with an average worldwide gross of $659.7 million per film. Finding Nemo (2003), along with its sequel Finding Dory (2016), as well as Toy Story 3 (2010) and Incredibles 2 (2018) are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, with the latter being the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time with a gross of $1.2 billion. Fifteen of Pixar's films are also among the 50 highest-grossing animated films of all time. 
 
With a passionate community and moderation crew this is an upstanding and quality subreddit that's dedicated to Pixar. For over 30 years, Pixar has touched the hearts of millions around the world through its 20 feature-length masterpieces and countless short films. With no end in sight there is a tremendous amount to discuss and connect over I highly recommend checking this sub out!

The ability to copy and paste has given power to users for decades. Writing an assignment the night before it's due, on a subject you have no knowledge about? Easy - copy and paste from [Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LandingPage&country=GB&uselang=en&utm_medium=donatewiki_page&utm_source=Ways_to_Give&utm_campaign=donate_now_btn)! Losing an argument  with someone online? Then just copy and paste a long death threat from /r/copypasta!  
  
/r/copypasta is a subreddit which does what it says on the tin - it's for copypasta! For the zero people who don't know what copypasta is, Wikipedia defines them as ""blocks of text which get copy and pasted across the Internet by individuals through online forums and social networking websites, to the point of becoming spam.""  
  
My favourite copypasta is the Navy Seal copypasta which goes as follows:  
  
*ahem*  
  
^(**What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.**)

**42,883** mad cunts *drinking VB* for **6 fucking years!**  
  
Now I know you Aussie cunts out there are tired of all the political shit going on over at r/Australia. Well luckily I've got a great fucking subreddit for ya. You've probably already heard of it, but if you haven't, say hello to r/Straya. Now I sat down with the cunts that moderate r/Straya and asked them some questions, and they gave me some bloody good answers I tell ya what.

> Why'd you decide to all of a sudden join/create the place?

>> /u/Phazon2000 Oh yeah good yarn that. I wanted to impersonate a member of the mod team to get a role on some loose girl's discord and see some cheeky piccies of her, so I asked the mods to put me on temporarily. One of the lads got confused by what I was saying and was asking if I was applying for an actual mod position so I said ""yeah ok"". I had a choice between sending raunchy photos of my girl or me doing something sick to get modded so I grabbed a whip and whipped my hills-hoist while wearing an Akubra and holding giant VB bottle. The rest is history.

>> /u/abigredball I remember finding it in like 2016 but I was also drinking a 4lt goon sack every 3 days and smoking a quarter a week that year (not even exaggerating). So I have no fucking idea how I found this place. It used to be on /r/all, I think I either found it there or there was some shit on /r/australia. I used to fucking check like where shit was also posted and shit and there was some shit that was also posted here. I dunno, I really liked it, posted a lot, and ended up being made a mod like a year later. I was good at stealing good shit off other places and reposting in there. Mostly cause half my mates are bogan as fuck so my FB is just full of it.

>> /u/Biz2324 The drongos at r/Australia wouldn't stop whingeing and being politically biased so I punched some random Aussie slang into google filtering Reddit and r/straya popped up. Made a post about what galahs the ""other sub"" are and got told that was old news. Made a few posts and joined in the banter. Was approached by u/cuntosaurus to be a mod and accepted. The true blue test came as ""Oi cunt why didn't ya lend me money when I asked you at the pub last week?"" to which I replied ""Sorry mate I blew all me dole in the pokies"".

> What's some of your favourite shit that gets posted on the sub?

>> /u/Phazon2000 My favourite is probably short (under a minute) OC videos and anything involving out native wildlife (assuming they're not getting too munted on ciggies or grog).

>> /u/abigredball Anything drug or alcohol related. I cannot hide my roots.

> Why should the cunts reading this visit r/Straya?

>> /u/Phazon2000 Because they're Aussies who love to embrace our cherished culture with a mod team that's the equivelant of your mate getting his hands on a second-hand copper's uniform.

>> /u/Biz2324 Most importantly for a laugh. But also to talk shit, take the piss out of each other and celebrate what being Aussie is truly about without moaning about the wankers in Canberra 24/7.

>> /u/ABigRedBall Fuckin don't fucking come in and pretend you live here. Fuck off we're full and all that. But just don't fucking come in and try to fake the accent. At least lurk a bit before you do. Some people REAALY LOIKE TO THOINK THEY KNOW HOW TAR SPEAK FLAMMING FAIR DINKUM AUSSIE and it's just fucking shit as. But yeah, come on and have a gander. Comment and upvote. Just know that all users who out themselves as seppos on the sub do get the honour of having the legendary 'Seppo2' un-removable flair.

To all you Aussies reading this, Happy Australia Day! Although the bot that posts these is dumb and this will actually get posted on the 27th for the Eastern states, I'd still like to point out the fact that even though not everyone agrees on what the day means, I think we all know that it's a great day for us Aussies to come together and celebrate our great country. Australians may represent only a tiny minority of Redditors, but we're still out there. Anyways it's back to the pub for me! Cheers, fellas!

NoCopyrightSounds is a record label dedicated to releasing FREE music for the sole purpose of providing creators with the finest sounds to enhance the creativity and popularity of their content, safe from any copyright claims or infringement. It's surprising that this subreddit is so small given the popularity of NCS music.  

We last featured /r/NoCopyrightSounds exactly [2 years ago as part of Tiny Subreddit Of The Day Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/5pvyxl/january_24th_2017_rnocopyrightsounds_free_music/), back when it only had 390 subscribers. It has since over doubled in size, [as has the YouTube channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/nocopyrightsounds/comments/acyaz0/20_million_subscribers/), and yet NCS is still offering great copyright free music!

Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman.

Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. However, Avenged Sevenfold's style had evolved by the band's third album and first major label release, City of Evil, into a heavy metal and hard rock style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, James ""The Rev"" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of drummer Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), and released and toured in support of its fifth album Nightmare in 2010, which debuted on the top spot of the Billboard 200, Avenged Sevenfold's first number one debut.

To date, Avenged Sevenfold has released seven studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide. Avenged Sevenfold was ranked No. 47 on Loudwire's list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time. Avenged Sevenfold have released an original song for each game in the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.  

Here on /r/avengedsevenfold you'll find everything from Discussion, covers, art, theories, videos..etc whether you're a fan or this is your first time hearing about them I highly suggest giving them a shot! I remember spending hours listening to them and trying to learn their songs on guitar everytime I think of them I can't help but smile!

There's something about placing cups on edges that satisfies me. I know, I know, it should give you anxiety, but looking at its position at the edge and knowing it won't fall brings me great satisfaction.  
  
/r/CupsOnEdges is a subreddit for cups on edges. Cups like [this one.](https://i.redd.it/6puqdxfpx0421.jpg) ^(is that even legal?) Or even cups like [this branded one.](https://i.redd.it/tb6ocbeckz121.jpg) ^(something something HailCorporate) [Here's](https://i.redd.it/rn53coj3j0t11.jpg) even a third example! I'm so kind. Whether you look through the pictures on the sub while biting your fingernails or after a long day of work to unwind, /r/CupsOnEdges lives up to its name!
   
To hear more about the subreddit and its community, the mods of /r/CupsOnEdges!
  
>##1. Why did you join/create the subreddit?  
  
>>**/u/Trapper19** I helped create the subreddit because I thought it was a good idea for some reason.  
  
>>**/u/Tygerwave** I joined because I had nothing nothing else to do and I like a little stress everyday.  
  
>>**/u/thendofthebeginning** I wanted there to be a source of the daily dose of anxiety to push people through the day. Additionally, I wanted a proper settlement for a niche, yet fun skill to be pushed to its creative limits.  
  
>##2. What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?   
  
>>**/u/Trapper19** [“an extreme can”](https://www.reddit.com/r/CupsOnEdges/comments/9fizj2/an_extreme_can/)  
  
>>**/u/Tygerwave** My favorite posts are [my posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/CupsOnEdges/search?q=author%3ATygerwave&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). They are the best ones.  
  
>>**/u/thendofthebeginning** Personally, I enjoy the post titled [“UH OH”](https://www.reddit.com/r/CupsOnEdges/comments/99sesc/uh_oh/). It’s an interesting take on the phrase regarding spaghettios.  
  
>##3. What do you think about the combination of cups and edges creates anxiety?   

>>**/u/FriedFreedoms** You just get the feeling you will accidentally bump it when trying to grab it and it wall fall off, dumping the contents all over and breaking. Again.   
  
>>**/u/Tygerwave** I want the cup to fall, it gives me anxiety when it doesn't.  
  
>>**/u/thendofthebeginning** The thrill of knowing a cup may fall, being pushed to the very limit of its balance, and spill its contents or shatter is the key to forming anxiety.  
  
>##4. Anything else you would like to add?   

>>**/u/FriedFreedoms** Anything? u/thendofthebeginning Has really put in the effort for this sub and keeping it interesting with the challenges!  
  
>>**/u/thendofthebeginning** I think it would be neat if the OG themself, [@beavis_sinatra](https://twitter.com/beavis_sinatra), showed up at some point. They are, after all, the true inspiration to r/CupsOnEdges.

&nbsp;

Well... shit. That's a lot of subscribers.


This is a special feature. All features on this sub are special, don't get me wrong, but this one is specialer than the rest (it's a word, trust me, I mod a sub with over 500k subscribers). For our not-so-little sub has just reached the grand total of 500 thousand subscribers.

This is a massive milestone for us. Getting an arbitrary amount of subscribers is always a good occasion, for any sub, but I feel for /r/SubredditOfTheDay, it's just that much more important. See, our sub demands content, and it demands a lot of it. I often make the comparison that we're like [the news] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWZxO4UhVE); no matter what happens, no matter how busy all the mods are, no matter how bad the bot is messing up, something must go out every single day. Every. Damn. Day. And while I can tell you from experience that the stuff that goes up some days isn't the best, isn't of the highest quality, has no soul in it, the fact is that we've gotten something out every day since this sub began. If it hadn't been for all of you, the subscribers, the people who read and enjoy the content, this sub would have been dead long before I joined.

This subreddit released its first feature on [May 1st, 2011] (http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/h14er/rmoviemusic_tracks_articles_research_videos_and/) - /r/MovieMusic. Written by one /u/tacoram. At the time, there wasn't even a written portion. (it was introduced by /u/SROTD [a week later] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/h6f4p/may_8_2011_rsketchdaily_your_daily_sketch/); his importance to the sub cannot be understated). 2,882 days and 499,891 subscribers later (we got a surprising amount of subs on the first day), we wrote this feature. 

In the beginning, this sub was just a place for people to say ""hey, this sub is cool"". We had no direction, no motives, no nothing. The mods essentially just wrote stuff as a writing exercise. Over time though... Well, those things are basically the tenets of the sub still. Without them, I honestly don't think anyone would give enough shits to write anything. But now, we have experience, we have direction, and we have quality. Instead of writing 3 sentences that nobody reads, we write 1000 word essays that nobody reads! Such an improvement!

&nbsp;

So you may be wondering, what now for SrotD ^(nobody's actually wondering that but shhh) ? Well, we're just going to keep doing what we're doing. Making features, promoting subs, bringing the awesome. We want to thank you all for sticking around, whether you're a new subscriber or an old one, you don't read the features or read them daily, or you're just here for the occasional bit of drama. Without you all supporting us our little sub wouldn't have gotten this far.

>>Roller derby is a contact sport played by two teams of five members roller skating counter-clockwise around a track. Roller derby is played by approximately 1,250 amateur leagues worldwide, mostly inside the United States.

>>Game play consists of a series of short match-ups (jams) in which both teams designate a jammer (who wears a star on the helmet). The jammer scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. The teams attempt to hinder the opposing jammer while assisting their own jammer—in effect, playing both offense and defense simultaneously.



 Here you will find all things Roller derby whether it be articles/blogs about roller derby, tips, advice, tutorials, and guides, ask for advice, give advice, discuss league politics and bylaws, share successes, accomplishments, and achievements,rants,random thoughts, ideas, and theories about derby,memes, videos, and gifs about derby, selfies, action shots, group photos, any image roller derby related. 

This is your one stop shop for all of it! I came across this subreddit after my my ex made me go to a match with her because her friend was playing in it. I went in not knowing what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome it was! I really believe you guy's should check it out whether you've played or this is your first time hearing about it!

It looks [beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExposurePorn/comments/afp7co/golden_sunset_at_golden_gate_44776716_oc). Did you click on that link? If you didn't - grave mistake. It's beautiful. Okay, I'll give you another link. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExposurePorn/comments/afj20v/oc_shooting_the_milky_way_with_a_friend_back_in) is one of my favourites, in fact [all the](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExposurePorn/comments/aawxo1/2018_was_easily_my_best_year_for_photographing) [space-related](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExposurePorn/comments/a2i6gl/international_space_station_iss_flies_between_two) [ones are](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExposurePorn/comments/7n7yh0/still_insane_to_me_that_the_andromeda_galaxy_is)!  
  
In conclusion, do you have eyes? Do you like looking at beautiful things? Then do yourself a favour and give this sub a sub!

/r/PolicePorn is a for pictures of law enforcement officers, vehicles, or equipment, from any country, whether they are [funny](http://i.imgur.com/WVeq3W3.jpg), [cool](https://i.imgur.com/RBFbH1P.jpg), or just [of two police officers talking](http://i.imgur.com/bAQixvK.jpg?1). Of course, /r/PolicePorn isn't about only showing the light and fluffy side of law enforcement, it doesn't shy away from showing the side of policing that we all wish didn't exist. Like terrifying [military police](http://i.imgur.com/6DLJn8a.jpg), the use of [tear gas](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2017/05/photos-of-the-week-42955/w20_AP17118833947955/main_900.jpg?1494004871) or even just an [uncomfortable looking arrest](http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1395897/notting-hill-carnival-arrest.jpg). It's an unfortunate reality that bad things happen, the wrong decisions are made and people get hurt. There's no escaping that and I don't think that /r/PolicePorn tries to avoid addressing that.

It's very easy to forget that people in a position of authority are, in fact, still people. /r/PolicePorn describes itself as being for ""pictures of law enforcement officers, vehicles, or equipment, from any country"". Beyond this, however, I'd like to think that /r/PolicePorn reminds us that behind the [cool threatening uniforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/policeporn/comments/a0jfvs/armed_british_transport_police_officers_at) are people, too, nothing more, nothing less, [doing their duty](https://www.reddit.com/r/policeporn/comments/87k62r/lt_col_posthumously_promoted_to_col_arnaud).

**108,298** Switch Gamers *looking for deals* for **2 years!**

So, you've been saving up for months, and now the day has finally come. You've just bought a brand new Nintendo Switch and you can't wait to sit down and play some Zelda and Smash. You set it up and then you realise, you haven't bought any games or accessories and you haven't got a lot of money left. Well this is where /r/NintendoSwitchDeals comes in! This passionate community of Nintendo Switch gamers is always on the lookout for the best deals on [games](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/a2c2ka/civilization_vi_switch_3999_target/), [controllers](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/a7p2sb/both_colors_of_joy_cons_5999_at_meijer/), [accessories](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/a1z9a6/go_check_your_local_walmart_discount_aisle/) and more, so you and everyone else can save themselves some cash. 


I have personally used a couple of deals from the subreddit and I find their [eShop deals thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/9oz8ia/current_nintendo_switch_eshop_deals/), which updates in real time and lists the prices for all the different regional eShops (helpful to me as an Aussie) really useful when buying new games digitally.

>#1. What made you start r/NintendoSwitchDeals?

>>**u/Coraldragon** [Klope62 and I] were originally in r/3DSDeals and when the Nintendo Switch was announced we decided to make a deals subreddit for it as well.

>#2. Are there any deals in particular that you yourself have used?

>>**u/Coraldragon** Majority of my deals were any sales at Best Buy because I had the GCU which gave a 20% discount to any Best Buy deal. Unfortunately they are discontinuing that, but it was the best way to get Nintendo deals since Nintendo tends to not have good deals.

>#3. Why should someone visit r/NintendoSwitchDeals?

>>**u/Coraldragon** We encourage anyone looking for any console, game, or accessory deals for the Nintendo Switch to visit. Deals tend to be more seasonal, but occasionally an amazing deal may pop up. For example, recently there was a Facebook marketplace deal that let you buy the Switch console for $180. This was the hottest deal in our history and made things quite exciting before Christmas.

>#4. Is there anything else you would like to add?

>>**u/Klope62** Apart from what Coraldragon has stated, I'd just like to say that our sub is very atraditional in the sense that really that only thing that brought us together was the fact that we were just people who liked deals and Nintendo... The growth was extremely unexpected, and every day is a process of learning how to foster an exceptional community of which there are no clear guidelines to follow... I am personally super thankful for all of the work all the team of moderators and other individuals in the community have done to allow us to grow into what we are today, as well as an extended thanks to the community itself for being patient as we ween through our growing pains and continue to work to be the best place for Nintendo Switch Deals on the internet!

Well there you have it folks. If you own a Nintendo Switch **and** you like saving money too, r/NintendoSwitchDeals is certainly the place for you.

 *Our eyes don’t lie: they’re windows to the soul. They show the truth, no matter what face we put on, in any situation. The best way to get to know someone is to look them in the eyes and observe what they reveal about their emotional state.*

*Our eyes, just like our body language, give us away, and they say more than we ever could with words. As a matter of fact, most of the information we convey is through nonverbal language, which ranges from simple looks to all of the movements we make.*

If you're new to r/eyes then have a look around and enjoy some glorious peepers! Some pro tips for you before making your first contribution:

Eye pics should be just that, pics of your eyes. One eyeball or across your two eyes is generally the most welcomed format.

Asking ""What color are my eyes"" is usually frowned upon in this sub. Generally the answer to that is, ""what do you have on your drivers license?"" There's nothing wrong with enjoying compliments on some great eyeballs but feigning ignorance probably won't lead you to very good responses.

Try to keep gross/medical eyeball posts to a minimum. People are here for the pretty colors/unique patterns, not to see how you sliced your eye open.

Letter to an ex? Mad at your parents? Roommates getting to you? Thankful but can't express it?

Reading the posts on here has been an incredibly cathartic experience just reading them open up and let all these emotions out. It's been extremely helpful personally.

Here to talk more about themselves and the community are the mods of /r/vegan!
  
>##1. Why did you join the subreddit?   

>>**/u/YourVeganFallacyIs** Reddit was one of those things I generally knew about, but had never interacted with much, when one day I had a HUGE spike in traffic on yourveganfallacyis.com from reddit. It turns out that someone had shared a link to my site on r/vegan. I joined immediately afterwards, and discovered I was very much among my people here. A couple years later I answered the call for new mods for the sub, and here I am.  
  
>>**/u/davidvanbeveren** First I saw a video on youtube that was called [""Dairy is Scary""](https://youtu.be/UcN7SGGoCNI), it's a 5 minute video and it really got me thinking. I then found the documentary ""Cowspiracy""on Netflix which really opened my eyes on where my dairy was coming from, and more importantly, how it was made. Being a hardcore reddit enthusiast, I searched reddit and found /r/Vegan where the community was absolutely vital in helping me transition to a more compassionate and healthy diet. I'm really thankful, I lost one milk and I gained several new ones!  
  
>>**/u/DreamTeamVegan** I was a passive lurker because of my interest for veganism but when I became more actively involved in the subreddit is when I realized the opportunity for animal rights advocacy that is available when posts reach the wider audience of general Reddit users. That’s when I really became interested in sharing information about animal rights, speciesism and veganism through comments and submissions. I understand this isn’t the community’s primary focus, it’s more of a space for vegans who are already vegan to discuss and share but I can never pass up a good advocacy opportunity.  
  
>##2. What's the best meal you've ever had?
  
>>**/u/YourVeganFallacyIs** This a question that always gives me pause -- *even* when it comes from other vegans. On its face, this would seem like a reasonable thing to ask a vegan, but doing so -- especially on those occasions when it's done in absence of other inquiries -- reveals a potential misconception on the part of the questioner about what ""veganism"" actually is. When asked this sort of thing, I often find myself (after some intervening conversation) going on to explain what veganism is and isn't.   

>> That aside, I'd say that my favorite meal as a vegan is a toss up between the Smoke & Barrel in DC -- those people have figured out how to some pretty magical things with tofu -- and the Lava Restaurant at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland -- my spouse and I ordered a four course ""chef's choice"" meal there that I'll never forget.  
  
>>**/u/DreamTeamVegan** I have no idea. I’ve never been someone who particularly enjoyed food, so picking a best meal is next to impossible. I do have some memorable experiences that occurred while enjoying the company of others during a meal. In particular, a meal I had after a vigil outside of a pig slaughterhouse really stands out for me. A group of us had been bearing witness outside a pig slaughterhouse and it had been a particularly upsetting afternoon because this building had installed gas chambers to kill the pigs and you can hear them screaming from outside the slaughterhouse. Some of us were pretty shaken up, but we shared a meal together and really showed the power of community by being supportive of each other’s feelings and being optimistic by brainstorming new activism strategies to stop the exploitation and death of future pigs. Eating a meal with a community who shares your values is what really makes a good meal for me.  
  
>>**/u/davidvanbeveren** For a restaurant, hands down this Vegan Mac and Cheese made at ""Veganized"" which is located in New Jersey. The dominos where I live (The Netherlands) makes three different vegan pizza's which are also really good. Lastly, Whole Foods has this orange chicken made by Gardien that's really fantastic.  
  
>##3. What would you say to anyone visiting /r/vegan for the first time?   

>>**/u/YourVeganFallacyIs** WELCOME! Please keep in mind that all voices are encouraged and needed here, but that this is a community created by vegans for vegans to discuss veganism with other vegans, and with the vegan curious. Please always be civil here (a policy we enforce regardless of one's creed), but other than that, everyone's free to politely speak their mind.   
  
>>**/u/DreamTeamVegan** I’d probably say what I almost always say about anyone’s first visit to any community; read or listen before commenting. There’s definitely been a number of times (on Reddit and outside) where I would have made a fool of myself to open my mouth when I was new to a community and I didn’t understand something. Listening to understand first is really important before engaging, we should always seek to understand before asking to be understood ourselves. With that in mind, I’d really encourage anyone stopping by for the first time to read a few resources before chiming in, or simply observing for a bit. If all visitors read our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/beginnersguide) that would be huge for community interaction in a positive way.  
  
>>**/u/davidvanbeveren** Jump into our Weekly Discussion threads and ask away! When you're not Vegan, you typically have 101 questions going through your head. The community is here ready to help you in any way possible, so jump head in and we'll welcome you with open arms! Our community is a really great place to get educated, support, and have a safe place to chat with other like-minded Vegans. It's lovely.   
  
>>**/u/Puriflied** I'm going to be honest: buckle up. This is still a community where almost anything can happen. You will mostly likely create some initial opinion of our community at first, and usually it will sway from anywhere between one end to another. What matters is your level of persistence and how well you receive any kind of message on this sub.    
  
>##4. Tell us about the /r/vegan community!   

>>**/u/YourVeganFallacyIs** We tend to be **very** welcoming to all serious and/or honest discussions, and are happy to share our stories or advice when asked. In general though, the purpose of the community isn't vegan advocacy per se; we *do* answer a lot of questions from pre-vegans about veganism here, but this sub actually and only exists to serve the interests of those who are already vegans, and this sub is not necessarily used as a means of spreading veganism or for reaching out to convert people. We do our level best to be polite to those who come here to argue against veganism, and we generally advise such peeps to find the answers they seek over in r/DebateAVegan instead. We tend not to be the least bit receptive to trolls or rudeness, and aggressively moderate for this (no matter if it's a vegan or a pre-vegan; we're strictly even handed in that way here).  
  
>>**/u/Puriflied** Usually a nice group - a lot of good discussions are brought up. I've had my eye on a group consisting of members here who produce top-notch responses to newbie questions and concerns. If you need help with something about veganism, we have you covered. You will almost have full certainty that someone here will direct you to the information that you need.     
  
>>**/u/DreamTeamVegan** We’re a passionate bunch and that makes for a lot of lively threads! Generally I see our community as welcoming to those who come with good intentions but our patience is tested often by those who come and treat the exploitation of non-human animals as a joke. I’ve really enjoyed some laughs from our users over the years as we share our stories and experiences and we are growing quite quickly which is always exciting!  
  
>##5. Anything else you would like to add?   

>>**/u/YourVeganFallacyIs** We're a community that understands the word ""vegan"" to mean a philosophical position concerned with the ethical treatment of other animals, and not the all-to-common misconception that it's a diet, and we rely on the definition provided by The Vegan Society; i.e. ""A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practicable — all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.""   
  
>>**/u/DreamTeamVegan** A lot of the confusion, misunderstanding and hostility of vegans interacting with non-vegans in our community stems from a fundamental misunderstanding about why vegans do what they do. Often we are viewed as a group of humans trying to advocate for another group of humans to eat our diet. In reality, veganism is not a diet, but an ethical position that rejects the exploitation of non-human animals. If we could re-frame our community as one who is advocating on behalf of non-human animals, I think we would be much better understood. I look forward to continuing to build connection within and outside the community as we all strive to create a world with empathy that meets everyone’s needs, including non-human animals. If you want to be a part of that, come check us out!  
  
>>**/u/davidvanbeveren** Keep an open mind towards vegans and understand that a lot of us are constantly bombarded by friends, family and society to eat meat and dairy products every day - it wears a lot of us down. Most Vegans have been exposed to various scary and extremely graphic videos showing the cruelty of the meat and dairy industry in slaughter houses. It's due to this exposure to the truth that it can make a lot of vegans feel hopeless, scared, and most of all - angry; which in turn makes a lot of us very passionate in our lifestyles.   

>> Vegans just want to end the animal suffering, improve their health, and save the environment. If I could ask you (the reader) one thing: please consider transitioning to a more plant-based diet, even if it's just switching from milk to plant-milks, any step makes a difference for your health and for our animal friends. Oh also, watch [Dairy is Scary](https://youtu.be/UcN7SGGoCNI) on youtube, it's only 5 minutes but it's a fantastic intro on why we do what we do!

Did you see a gif that keeps getting funnier and funnier the longer you stare at it? This might be the right place to share it.This is a subreddit dedicated to those gifs that just keep on getting better every time it repeats. I like many of you have come across one of those gifs that just stop you in your tracks and you have to just keep watching it because its too good. That's what /r/BetterEveryLoop is all about!

One of the gifs that has done that to me is this one called [""Connor McGregor's arms are ready for anything."" ](https://i.imgur.com/n7Rnoz6.gifv) It made me look up gif subs other than /r/Gifs which lead me to /r/BetterEveryLoop and it immediately became one of my every day clicks. Its the sub that I come to after a tough day at work to get my mind off things and to recharge its a great experience. 

They recommend watching these gifs at work or some other place where you can't laugh for the best experience and I could not agree more. So when you want to watch a gif over and over again, and it gets better every time /r/BetterEveryLoop is the place for you.

 **Here are some of the best posts from the last few years:**

*  [Hey, Cardio is Important](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9ut3so/hey_cardio_is_important/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=BetterEveryLoop)
*  [Girl gets caught dipping a chicken nugget into her soda ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9utrph/girl_gets_caught_dipping_a_chicken_nugget_into/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=BetterEveryLoop)
*  [I guess that works too ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9umbni/i_guess_that_works_too/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=BetterEveryLoop)
*  [Meowch ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9urkfr/meowch/)
*  [This indoor water drain/fall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9uruon/this_indoor_water_drainfall/)
*  [Marcus Mariota delays the handoff until the very last moment before flipping the ball forward for the touchdown (x-post from r/sports)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9urhjx/marcus_mariota_delays_the_handoff_until_the_very/)
*  [Mommy.... (Dirtyphonics - Sayonara would probably fit this gif.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9usk0q/mommy_dirtyphonics_sayonara_would_probably_fit/)



 
>>##Do you remember the first gif you couldn't stop watching because it got better every loop?

>>**u/overactor** Yes, [it's this one](https://i.imgur.com/4hySgQo.gifv). I distinctly remember seeing it on /r/gifs and ~~laughing my ass off~~ exhaling sharply out of my nose for several minutes. That's the moment I came up with the idea for /r/BetterEveryLoop.

>>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/overactor** The ""original"" one is definitely up there, but looking through recent posts, I love this [owl](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9ofq1m/this_owl_changing_its_face_to_respond_to_threats/) and this [birb](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/9njps9/bamf/)

>>##In your opinion how does this subreddit differentiate from the many other Gif Subs?

>>**u/overactor** I think the premise of this sub makes for a very eclectic but high quality selection of gifs. We're not as limited as most comparable specific gif subs like /r/hmmmgifs or /r/DenseGifs (both of which I adore), but we still offer rewatchability unlike more general gif subs like /r/gifs. The gifs on our sub have to have a certain undefinable x-factor. Some gifs clearly have it and some obviously don't. But there's a whole world of grey in between and the trickiest part is, that just 50% of people thinking a gif doesn't fit, is not a good predictor for how much the other half will love it.

>>##How hard is it to mod this sub and what are some of the difficulties that come with it?

>>**u/overactor** That's what's most difficult about moderating /r/BetterEveryLoop (*referring to the answer to ""how does this subreddit differentiate from the many other Gif Subs""*). I'm very much against us as moderators enforcing strict standards, since the quality of the gifs is inherently and entirely subjective. We had a (now defunct) bot which gave commenters a way to vote a gif off the subreddit independently of the normal votes on a post. I'm not a 100% why we stopped doing that, but it wasn't perfect. I'm currently debating implementing a similar, improved system and rolling that out, so keep your eyes peeled for that.

>>##Since your modqueue is filled to the brim with gifs, how often are you surprised by something someone posted?

>>**u/overactor** We get the occasional NSFL post, which really boggles my mind. Even more surprising though, are the times when someone post a gif that is well over a minute long. A lot of them are quite cool, but often I barely get through them once, let alone multiple times.

>>##Why does someone need to visit this sub?

>>**u/overactor** Because their nose is clogged and internet-laughter is the best medicine for that particular ailment?

**37,939** *of Godzilla's Pets* for **8 years!**

 

Godzilla (Japanese: ゴジラ Hepburn: Gojira) (/ɡɒdˈzɪlə/; [ɡoꜜdʑiɾa] (About this soundlisten)) is a monster originating from a series of Japanese films of the same name. The character first appeared in Ishirō Honda's 1954 film Godzilla and became a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in various media, including 32 films produced by Toho, three Hollywood films and numerous video games, novels, comic books and television shows. It is often dubbed the King of the Monsters, a phrase first used in Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, the Americanized version of the original film.

Godzilla is depicted as an enormous, destructive, prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation. With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Lucky Dragon 5 incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons.  As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones, portraying Godzilla as an antihero, or a lesser threat who defends humanity. With the end of the Cold War, several post-1984 Godzilla films shifted the character's portrayal to themes including Japan's forgetfulness over its imperial past,  natural disasters and the human condition. 

Godzilla has been featured alongside many supporting characters. It has faced human opponents such as the JSDF, or other monsters, including King Ghidorah, Gigan and Mechagodzilla. Godzilla sometimes has allies, such as Rodan, Mothra and Anguirus, and offspring, such as Minilla and Godzilla Junior. Godzilla has also fought characters from other franchises in crossover media, such as RKO Pictures/Universal Studios movie monster King Kong and Marvel Comics characters S.H.I.E.L.D. the Fantastic Four and the Avengers.

Godzilla has been considered a filmographic metaphor for the United States, as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier Godzilla films, especially the original, portrayed Godzilla as a frightening nuclear-spawned monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence. As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character as the films became geared more towards children. Since then, the character has fallen somewhere in the middle, sometimes portrayed as a protector of the world from external threats and other times as a bringer of destruction.

If you are a fan of the property This is the place for anything related to Godzilla and his many foes. Post anything Godzilla, from toys to movies, screenshots to trailers, anything and everything Godzilla belongs here.

Spectacular Spider-Man was a cartoon from 2008-2009. Pretty much every Spider-Man loved the show. It was planned to have 65 episodes. Unfortunately, Disney acquired Marvel in 2009, and the show was cancelled with only 2 seasons and 26 episodes. Since then, lots of fans have wanted the show to return. It you haven’t watched the show yet, you definitely should!

The show was my childhood, and I watched it all the time. I was pretty sad when I heard that it was getting cancelled. The new shows like Ultimate Spider-Man and Marvel’s Spider-Man never reached the quality of Spectacular. One day while browsing, I saw a meme with the show in it. My childhood flashed back, and thus the sub was born.

We are all united by our love for the show. Sometimes we make shitposts about how much Ultimate sucks. Sometimes we make memes praying for Spectacular to return. We all want to keep our favorite cartoon alive. Who knows, someday we could even bring Spectacular back.

Happy New Year, everyone. Hope your 2018 was wonderful, and that your 2019 will be more so!

Ah, 2018 has been a fun year for Subreddit Of the Day. It's has its [ups] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/8xax4q/july_9th_2018_rthanosdidnothingwrong_snap/) and its [downs] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/95w84p/august_9th_2018_ryiffinhell_the_human_resistance/), but overall, it's been an excellent year for us. We've had some changes to how the sub functions, we're likely going to have more in the near future; you may have noticed a few differences (they're fairly minor, in fairness).


## Writers


We took on approximately 33 interns this year (and we got an extra 2 just today!)  Out of those interns, we gained 8 Full Time Writers! They've been the ones primarily writing the features this year.

We decided to make a SRotD Discord. Isn't really much too it at the moment. You can join it [here] (https://discord.gg/bZYNRzC) if you want to chat about SROTD, talk to us mods, or rant about how stupid our sub is.

## Mission Statement

When this sub began, our mission statement was this: **""Bringing The Awesome""**. Our goal was to feature the best and most awesome subs we could, every damn day. In 2016 however, we changed that mission statement; we felt that many of the subs we featured weren't ""awesome"" in the traditional sense. Ones that many people would dislike, due to them being political subs, or LGBT subs, or just subs that would be fairly controversial to the masses.

But this year, we decided to change it back. Featuring a ton of controversial subs helped us grow. Substantially so. But we felt that SRotD wasn't made for that. SRotD was made to feature good subreddits that deserve the spotlight. We wanted to be the sub that people come to for cool subs and shit, not to see the latest controversy. We decided, once more, that we would Bring The Awesome, every single day. And hopefully, it'll stay that way, for years to come. Can we guarantee that we won't feature a controversial sub way in the future? Realistically, no, we'll probably end up featuring a sub that nobody likes at some point. That's just statistics. But I can guarantee that we will try our hardest to feature the best subs we possibly can, until ~~we get bored and quit~~ the end of time!

## 2018 In Review

# A survey about the sub


We wanted to get some information to see how we could improve the sub, so we've made a [short survey] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BdQpZm2w17D_MQg-QuaMdQx0lfMgQdjVIg7mfxO0dv4/) about the subreddit! It'll only take 3-4 minutes to fill out, so I cordially invite everyone to fill it in. It'd be much appreciated!


&nbsp;

# Ask Us Anything!

Welcome to the official Who Dat Nation subreddit! Here you will find all things New Orleans Saints related whether it be Discussions, Game day mega threads, Memes, theories, ..etc You name it here you'll find it! Bolstered by a passionate user base and moderators this is the right place for you if you're a Saints fan, NFL fan, or someone looking to get into it.
 
The New Orleans Saints are a professional American football team based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Saints currently compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The team was founded by John W. Mecom Jr., David Dixon, and the city of New Orleans on November 1, 1966. The Saints began play in Tulane Stadium in 1967.

The name ""Saints"" is an allusion to November 1 being All Saints Day in the Catholic faith. New Orleans has a large Catholic population, and the spiritual ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" is strongly associated with New Orleans and is often sung by fans at games. The franchise was founded on November 1, 1966. 

The team's primary colors are old gold and black; their logo is a simplified fleur-de-lis. They played their home games in Tulane Stadium through the 1974 NFL season. The following year, they moved to the new Louisiana Superdome (now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, since Mercedes-Benz has purchased the stadium's naming rights). 

For most of their first 20 years, the Saints were barely competitive, only getting to .500 twice. In 1987, they finished 12–3—their first-ever winning season—and qualified for the NFL playoffs for the first time in franchise history, but lost to the Minnesota Vikings 44–10. The next season in 1988 ended with a 10–6 record, but no playoff berth. Following the 2000 regular season, the Saints defeated the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams 31–28 to notch their first-ever playoff win.

In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast region. The Superdome was used as an emergency, temporary shelter for displaced residents. The stadium suffered damage from the hurricane (notably from flooding and part of the roof being torn off as well as internal damage from lack of available facilities). The Saints were forced to play their first scheduled home game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (the Giants' home stadium); other home games were rescheduled at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas or Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During the season, it was rumored that Saints' owner Tom Benson might deem the Superdome unusable and seek to legally void his contract and relocate the team to San Antonio, where he had business interests. Ultimately, however, the Superdome was repaired and renovated in time for the 2006 season at an estimated cost of US$185 million. The New Orleans Saints' first post-Katrina home game was an emotionally charged Monday Night Football game versus their division rival, the Atlanta Falcons. The Saints, under rookie head coach Sean Payton and new quarterback Drew Brees, defeated the Falcons 23–3, and went on to notch the second playoff win in franchise history.

The 2009 season was a historic one for the Saints. Winning a franchise-record 13 games, they qualified for Super Bowl XLIV and defeated the AFC champion Indianapolis Colts 31–17. To date, it is the only Super Bowl championship that they have won, and as it is the only Super Bowl the Saints have appeared in, they join the New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers as the only three NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance.

/r/ChristmasLights is a subreddit all about Lights! Here you can share your either your own Christmas light show or some you may have found in other places! 

One of my favorite memories of Christmas growing up was my driving around with my parents looking at Christmas Lights, its something I do till this day except now its just me listening to music driving around just enjoying the Christmas goodness!

With Christmas a few days away I thought this would be a perfect time to feature the sub. I believe its an underated sub that should be more popular than it is, it's a diamond in the rough but thats what /r/SubredditoftheDay is for. Shining a light on these great subs you might not know, or if you do another reason to check it out again!

**Here is a taste of what you'll find when you visit!**

>>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/Castriff**  I actually joined the subreddit after I acquired the /r/ChristmasMusic subreddit. The music sub's creator had been inactive for a long time and was getting a lot of spam. So I got a hold of it, and then the other mod (/u/enliST_CS) contacted me and we split the moderator duties for those two subs and also /r/santashelpers, /r/ChristmasDecorating, and /r/ChristmasList. It was a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I got into a whole network of Christmas subs for the price of one!  


>>##How has being a mod on here changed how you celebrate Christmas?

>>**u/Castriff** I think it hasn't changed how I celebrate, really. More like, I love celebrating Christmas so much that modding the Christmas subs just comes naturally to me. Christmas is my favorite holiday, and it's also really close to my birthday, so I love getting to be a part of a Christmas-based community.


>>##What makes this subreddit so special, what makes it stand out?

>>**u/Castriff**  The lights make it stand out, of course! Not only do you get to see the best displays, you'll find people willing to give tips on your own setup, so there's something here for everyone.

**15,383** *readers* for **10 Months!**

/r/ImaginarySliceOfLife is an image based subreddit dedicated to artwork representing every day life. Often seeking to glorify the mundane, ""Slice Of Life"" art depict day-to-day rhythms or general life experiences in a way that's romantic, wholesome, or thought-provoking. 

When it comes to art there are many, many different genres that all have their own merit. One of my favorites is definitely ""Slice of Life"" the Art that showcases aspects of life in realistic or fantastical settings. There is just something that puts me at ease viewing [pieces](https://i0.wp.com/78.media.tumblr.com/662af460202cefc5e56f88b04c5f6534/tumblr_p39fpqrsJs1qhttpto2_1280.jpg?w=605&ssl=1) like [these,](https://i.redd.it/86cj1mviaxk01.png) I [mean](http://i.imgur.com/D07JJQl.jpg) who hasn't drifted off into a day dream. Seeing these so called [mundane](https://artlords-artwork.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image/10232/display_metro_01_700.jpg) everyday [paintings](https://cdn.awwni.me/upfz.jpg) just [brings](https://i.imgur.com/l5tCFAi.jpg) a [smile](https://i.imgur.com/izJUg9O.png) to my face [everytime](https://i.imgur.com/tna8Bo4.gifv). I like that it doesn't have to always be some creature, battle, over the top sequence it can just ""be"". To me its one of the biggest gems of the Imaginary Network.

If you're wondering what that is, [The Imaginary Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork/) Expanded (INE) is a network of art sharing subreddits ranging from broad in subject to very specific. It is the goal of the INE to share, inspire, discuss and appreciate paintings, drawings, and digital art while maintaining artist credit and source links.
Our promise is to show respect to content creators, submitters, and subscribers. It is our sincerest hope that you will find our moderation team approachable and helpful and the INE subreddits an interesting and fun place to be.

>>##How did you find the sub and what made you want to moderate it?

>>**u/_Eltanin_** /u/ZeroCiipheR recruited me since I was a frequent contributor to other art sharing subs content of which overlapped with stuff that could be posted in here. I was hesitant at first since I've never been a part of a big network of subreddits before and I've heard of a few bad eggs spoiling the experience under the imaginary network name but Zero's been incredibly accommodating with answering all my inquiries and initial doubts. Add on top of that their clear desire to simply share their passion, something I resonated with, and I was on board.

>>##What makes this subreddit so special, what makes it stand out?

>>**u/_Eltanin_** [It's MAX COMFY](https://i.imgur.com/1BvaFHM.png). Slice of Life is an aspect that everyone can relate to even if they're not a fan of the medium in which it is most prevailent in; anime. With so many amazing artworks that fall under this umbrella, it's hard not to fall in love with it.

>>##Do you have a favorite post on the sub?

>>**u/_Eltanin_** [Palette](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginarySliceOfLife/comments/8iwb4v/palette_lack/) by lack is the image that motivated me to start sharing artwork through reddit in the first place so it holds that special place for me in that it's a piece that encapsulates a lot of what I like about art in general. The fantasy of it all, the bright and optimistic outlook towards creativity, multiple stories frozen in this peaceful moment in time yet to be told are all things that this piece manages to convey. That and it's really pretty.

>##Why does someone need to visit this sub?

>>**u/_Eltanin_** /r/ImaginarySliceOfLife captures a certain type of atmosphere that most users have admitted to feeling nostalgic over things and events they've never even been a part of. It is filled with tranquil snapshots of the joys, annoyances, wonder and mundanity of life; fictional, fantastic, realistic or otherwise. If this sort of content sounds like something that appeals to you, well you're in luck. If not? Well try having a gander at it anyway. It might just be your next favorite thing.

**115,203** subscribers, a community for **7 months!**  
   
In 2018, when [the anti-vax movement is on the rise](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2018/05/how-fake-science-costing-lives-malign-rise-anti-vaxxers) and social media allows us to see the abusive ""parenting"" which would otherwise not be on display, it can sometimes feel as if the world has gone mad around you as definitive cases of child abuse are no longer that clear to many people.  
  
/r/CasualChildAbuse is a subreddit for displaying these child abusers who seem to be really open about it. Whether it be neglect or emotional/sexual/physical abuse, as the sidebar says, ""Casual child abuse is *not* abuse we tolerate or should tolerate."" The child abusers often find insane ways of justifying their behaviour, whether it be [saying that God told them that they shouldn't give their child shots by giving him a throat infection](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualChildAbuse/comments/9p8c8p/thanks_god_for_giving_my_child_an_infection/), [circumcising their boy in order to please God](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualChildAbuse/comments/9nuc00/the_emojis_sting_a_little/), or [letting their 10-month-old girl die of malnutrition and dehydration after refusing to get help for religious reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualChildAbuse/comments/95lckm/christian_parents_who_let_their_10monthold_girl/). 
  
Here to talk about the creation of the subreddit and the people is the creator of the subreddit - /u/lydocia!
  
>##1. Why did you create the subreddit?   

>>**/u/lydocia**  Mostly because I saw many posts in /r/AntiMLM and /r/insanepeoplefacebook that were just so obviously child abuse, but people glossed over that fact - so I wanted to bundle them into a subreddit that calls out that casual child abuse. My goal was to bring this under people's attention, so that, if they see one of these things happen close to them (maybe their neighbour, someone in their family, a facebook friend) that they would recognise it as abuse and actually take the steps to report it, and change a child's life.   
  
>##2. What *is* casual child abuse?  

>>**/u/lydocia**  The defintion of casual child abuse is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualChildAbuse/comments/947qya/rcasualchildabuse_v20_what_has_changed_what_will/).  

>##3. What's the thing people who end up in this sub do that annoys you the most?  

>>**/u/lydocia** Do you mean the users or the people in the posts? If it's the users, it's that they tend to get so worked up over the matter at hand (which I reckon is only natural) that they forget that their fellow Redditors are still human. They tend to get so caught up in the hate train that they forget to practice critical thinking, to look up scientific information, basically just become so full of hate, which often results in petty pedantic arguments and downvote brigades. If you mean the actual casual child abusers themselves, well, that's obvious: they are mistreating their own child, what should be the most precious thing in the world to them.

Today is a very special day. I could go into all the stereotypical things that people say about it, but you know all that. It's Christmas. Christmas means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. For some, it's a time to celebrate the birth of Christ. For others, it's a time to get presents and cool shit. And for some, it's a time to help out those who don't have anyone else.


But enough of that soppy shite. Festivities! Today's going to be an excellent day. I'm sure you're all having absolutely wonderful ones. I'm guessing when you're reading this, it's late in the day, and you're just done with the celebrations. Because nobody just got up today and thought ""right, I'm off to check on /r/SubredditOfTheDay"". I hope you all had wonderful days. I certainly did. And the people over on /r/Christmas did too! ^^10/10 ^^segue 

/r/Christmas is a sub that's all about the festivities that this time of year has to offer. You got all the good Christmas shit. You got [trees] (https://www.reddit.com/r/christmas/comments/9yb2vi/the_tree_is_up/), you got [insane decorations] (https://www.reddit.com/r/christmas/comments/a16w8g/my_familys_christmas_village/), you got [lights] (https://www.reddit.com/r/christmas/comments/a3siez/grandpa_hated_untangling_his_christmas_lights/), you got [seasonal karmawhoring] (https://www.reddit.com/r/christmas/comments/5k4isd/boys_in_blue_get_thousands_of_upvotes_how_about/), everything Christmas related you could possibly want from Reddit, you can find it right here!


Now I needn't keep you longer. I'm sure you have other things to be doing than reading posts on a semi-dead subreddit on the internet. Thank you for sticking around and reading this in the first place! 

Regardless of what your Christmas is, there's one thing that's the same for everyone. Friendship. Whether it's with your family, your friends or your internet pals, Christmas has a little bit of love in store for all. And that's why it should be cherished, regardless of your religious beliefs. Let's be honest, Christmas transcended being a religious festival a *looong* time ago. So in the spirit of Christmas, here's some sincere words from each of the SROTD family:

>> Another great year of giving subs love! Merry Christmas, and don't forget to tell the important people in your life just how much they mean to you.

Welcome /r/ChristmasDecorating is a subreddit dedicated to sharing the decorations you have put up as well as ones you have seen either on the internet or in person! Whether its Christmas lights, trees, wreaths, ornaments, lawn decorations..etc this is the subreddit for you

Every year it feels like they move up selling Christmas decorations earlier and earlier, shoot this year it was October 25th and I saw 3 isles of decorations in a few stores near me.I can't blame them its the most magical time of the year by far. I wanted to feature this subreddit because I feel like we can never have enough Christmas joy. 

While I was never able to have an elaborate set up for my home growing up, it was modest but I've always wanted to have an over the top one like you see on TV or in films. This subreddit has given me tons of ideas for when I'm able to decorate my home in the coming years. 


**Here is a taste of what you'll find when you visit!**


*  [My mother has been given weeks to months to live, her cancer has spread out of control now.

**1,761** *elves* for **6 years!**

  /r/LookAtMyTree is a subreddit dedicated to showing off your Christmas tree as well as ones you have seen either on the internet or in person!  One of the best feelings growing up was seeing the Christmas tree turned on for the first time, its a feeling that never stops making me happy each year!

An interesting fact about why we put Christmas Lights on trees is because when churches began putting up Christmas trees, they would often go up next to shelves stacked with candles. These candles were soon used to decorate the tree, which later evolved into putting up Christmas lights and ornaments. 

This is a great subreddit for checking out other peoples tree's and sharing your own. I definitely have a few saved so I can take inspiration from them in the coming years. Of course, you're not here just for me to explain how the sub works. You're here to see beautiful photos

**44,914** 14 year olds *laughing* for **6 years!**  
   
Since [we featured /r/im14andthisisfunny over 6 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/14dhvw/december_6_2012_rim14andthisisfunny_its_a/), so much has changed. It has grown from a small subreddit of only 1,567 subscribers to over 40,000. The once sole mod and creator of the sub, /u/HoneyBadgers_Forever, has deleted his account. However, a lot has not changed. Such as the fact that farts are still funny and **69** will forever be the s*x number! ^XDDDDDDDD  
  
/r/im14andthisisfunny discusses and shares examples of that stupid sense of humour we all had when we were 14. That *[""OMG GUYS IT SAYS 69!!!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny/comments/9mmr8a/69k_xddddd/)* sense of humour, when we saw the number *420* and couldn't help but laugh over how *[""OMG IT'S THE WEED NUMBER GUYS!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny/comments/9onrvh/reddit_version_420_roflllll/)* or see the shape of a DICK and exclaim *[""IT'S A PENIS LOL! A PENIS!!!!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny/comments/9mtj4g/penisland/)*  
While the main purpose of the sub is to make fun of this type of sense of humour, you occasionally get a real 14 year old [posting about how they find the posts actually quite funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny/comments/9uyu6c/im_14_and_i_genuinely_find_some_of_this_stuff/), and sometimes you actually do find a post funny and think... *do I have the sense of humour of a 14 year old?*

For a look at the sub at its ~~best~~ worst, my favourite 3 posts:  
  
1. [how low effort can the posts on r/thanosdidnothingwrong get? (TFW you masturbate for the first time)](https://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny/comments/8y4dtp/how_low_effort_can_the_posts_on/)

**50,082** cryophiles for **7** years!

Hey everyone, happy winter solstice! Chances are, you've probably already be seeing the signs of winter around (unless you live near me). The trees might be dying, the ground might be turning white, and it might be dark and miserable all the time. Or not, I don't really know much about winter since it doesn't exist where I live.

Thankfully, if you are only able to dream of a White Christmas, there's a subreddit for that very purpose. Introducing, /r/WinterPorn. Despite the risque sounding name, /r/WinterPorn is 100% safe for work. Unless you come across some animal that was killed by the temperature. Is that common? I don't know!

Since the last time we featured it wayyyyy [back in 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/15d7pn/december_24_2012_rwinterporn_let_it_snow_let_it/), /r/WinterPorn has grown at a steady rate from a humble 6k to a slightly less humble 50k people like me who are trying to figure out what this ""snow"" thing is. ([This](https://www.reddit.com/r/winterporn/comments/3lb8fy/a_very_quiet_snowy_day_in_london_600x845/) is what it looks like. Amazing!)

From the SROTD team, we wish you a happy holiday, and we hope you don't freeze to death.

**730** Trekkers, a community for **over a year**!  
  
/r/UnitedFederation is different from your traditional Reddit subs - the primary focus is not so much a way to directly post links or self posts, but to pull submissions from member Trek communities that are part of The United Federation of Reddit. At the core is a multireddit that one of our mods has created, containing Star Trek subreddits that are part of this Federation. As those subreddits themselves get content, that content is then shown on /r/UnitedFederation and links to the sub it came from.  
  
Think of United Federation of Reddit as an analogy to United Federation of Planets in Star Trek: a coalition or alliance of members with a common goal. It was the idea of the founding members of United Federation to be a landing place for users looking to broaden their interests in Trek specialty subs. The sidebar of /r/UnitedFederation lists active Trek communities, from /r/sonicshowerthoughts to /r/StarTrekMemes to /r/TrekRP. We currently stand at over 30 subreddits!  
  
We have also recently started doing a podcast where the format is about Star Trek as it relates to the Reddit community. Our goal is to make the podcast a regular thing and to bring more exposure to the United Federation of Reddit members.

**1,076,058** *rare boyes n' girles* for **3 years**!

&nbsp;

All dogs are good dogs, and none of them deserve to be left out of this Theme Week!

/r/RarePuppers is the sub for the best puppers. This means *all* the puppers. This sub is the absolute best place on Reddit for pictures of all kinds of goodboyes and goodgirles alike! You got [goodboyes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/76j3bs/no_dig_pls_i_dig_pet_me_pls/), [badboyes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/77efmm/woof_news_pupper_in_jail_for_stealing_yo_girl/) (so cool!), [big puppers] (https://old.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/9vllk4/19yearsold_and_still_smiling/), [small puppers] (https://old.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/8uajok/this_is_my_boy_zero_9_weeks_old/), [hero pups] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/6tkimb/tonight_this_guy_barked_at_me_for_thirty_minutes/), [goodgirles] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/98ktda/therapy_good_girle/), [friendos] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/7c2dux/dont_wory_shellboye_i_wait_for_fren/), and many many many many many more varieties!

Look at [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/92ht2q/looked_up_from_my_work_computer_to_find_someone/) beautiful pup, for example. So patient. So caring. Look at the little tail!

Or [this] (https://old.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/a3hoj9/old_but_gold/) old boye right here, having a lovely little boat ride. Got his life jacket on and everything (safety first). An excellent example of some of the content you'll see on this sub! The community are excellent and kind, and make wonderful posts, like [this] (https://old.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/9r8yro/i_got_you_little_buddy/) one, as an example. It's a puppy, and an adorable one at that! I'd give it a solid 12/10, just like what I'd give this sub (if it were a dog, of course). Anyways, here's an interview with the mods. I'll go find some more puppers to showcase while you read this:

&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/The_Coolest_Sock**  Saw it trending when it had 7k subs and was like oh mann this is a good sub and the people (emilybanana, tpk, sabro..) were all neat people and the community was nice and good.

>> **/u/Librase** I'm a simple woman. I see puppers, I join up. Someone must have decided I'm a responsible adult because they invited me to be a mod.

>> **/u/PM_ME_YOUR_IZANAGI** friends

>> **/u/siouxsie_siouxv2** modded by oh_dangit back in the stone ages. Times were simpler then, modmail made sense, doggos were doggos, puppers were puppers

>> **/u/crazymunch** Same as most others, TPK added me as a mod back in the way and went from there

>> **/u/2SP00KY4ME** I was an active member of the Discord. When we decided we needed more mods a year or so ago, I was offered a spot!

>> **/u/oh_dangit** i made it haha but due to personal reasons why need no sharing here ive had to delete several accounts etc which is why this one is presently barren.

>> **/u/SabroToothTiger** I remember seeing the subreddit mentioned at /r/woof_irl, a sub where I was pretty active. I checked it out and fell in love with the sillyness of the sub.

>> **/u/N8theGr8** I think I was added as an approved submitter a while back, and it seemed like a fun sub, so I started posting content.  Eventually I was invited to help moderate, and my involvement now is mostly just trying to keep spam out.

> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>>  **/u/The_Coolest_Sock** a good time, there aren't many heckbois or rude dudes.

>> **/u/Librase** Generally good and lots of nice people, but you wouldn't believe some of the things we get.

>> **/u/PM_ME_YOUR_IZANAGI** pretty wholesome. some people can be mean, but a lot more people are participating in good faith and having a good time

>> **/u/siouxsie_siouxv2** It's fun, people seem to really enjoy showing off their dogs and it's a good for all

>> **/u/crazymunch** 95% of the time really fun, some of the threads that get high on /r/all can get a little hairy though!

>> **/u/2SP00KY4ME** I really enjoy being able to mod RP. It's a very special and calming place. Being a part of the team that keeps it that way is immensely gratifying.

>> **/u/SabroToothTiger** Modding this sub really brings a smile to my face, because i get to see so many good boys and girls everyday. It's a change from everyday stress. However, due to the pure and wholesome nature of the sub, we have to sometimes remove a lot of comments to keep things clean. We don't want any heckboyes on this sub \>:(

>> **/u/N8theGr8** https://i.redd.it/d064krjcvvk01.png



> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>>  **/u/The_Coolest_Sock**  the 7 flavors of pupps (thats the first submission i saw) https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/4h2x1c/the_pupper_spectrum_helpful_guide_to_distinguish/?st=j9hf54ph&sh=1b8aeded

>> **/u/Librase** From memory, a particular gif of a pupper running with a basket/cage on it never fails to cheer me up.

>> **/u/PM_ME_YOUR_IZANAGI** https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/94r3es/i_is_stuck/ probably this. it never fails to get me to laugh

>> **/u/tajjet** a while back we made a post about trying to promote creative titles and this meta post in response is one of my favs https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/6eyc56/the_fite_who_wil_win/

>> **/u/siouxsie_siouxv2** Mostly the posts I've made

>> **/u/crazymunch** https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/6congk/a_battle_for_the_ages/ - A timeless classic

>> **/u/2SP00KY4ME** I love posts of dogs juxtaposed with beautiful environments, like mountain ranges or flower beds. https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/96554h/levi_the_mini_aussie_puppy_at_lake_louise_in_banff/

>> **/u/oh_dangit** its probably been mentinoned but Good Life Doggo, which was made by a very special user to all of us moddos & won post of the year in 2014 (i think)

>> **/u/SabroToothTiger** [Good Life Doggo](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/4ryjhq/good_luck_friendos/) is my favourite. It warms my heart everytime i read it.

>> **/u/N8theGr8** [creashun of pupper](https://i.imgur.com/tMIW18y.jpg)

>> [they're good dogs brent](https://i.imgur.com/UShPfp1.jpg)


> **4: Do you have a pupper of your own? If so, please send a picture or 7!**

>>  **/u/The_Coolest_Sock** yes. http://imgur.com/gallery/LCtxHha

>> **/u/siouxsie_siouxv2** sorry i've got a hammyboy and he runs in his little wheel but no puppers

>> **/u/crazymunch** No doggo but this is my Kitty Katya! - https://i.redd.it/s22220zqnbj11.png


>> **/u/2SP00KY4ME** I have a Great Dane named Moxie! She's a snoozer. https://imgur.com/a/j6TLk5o


>> **/u/oh_dangit** sadly not, we used to have a few australian sheps with those beautiful colours but they passed on many years ago


>> **/u/N8theGr8** I have a hamster.  https://i.imgur.com/2RXTHTY.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/9S06DoL.jpg


> **5: What is your opinion on this sentence; ""That dog is a bad dog""?**

>>  **/u/The_Coolest_Sock** That sentence doesn't make sense on a fundamental level

>> **/u/Librase** There are no bad dogs, only mistreated/poorly-trained dogs

>> **/u/PM_ME_YOUR_IZANAGI** that sentence is a lie

>> **/u/siouxsie_siouxv2** pfft

>> **/u/crazymunch** There are no bad dogs that sentence is impossible

>> **/u/2SP00KY4ME** Them's fighting words.

>> **/u/oh_dangit**  this is statement doesnt make sense, bad, and dog in the same sentence cannot exist

>> **/u/SabroToothTiger** IMPOSSIBLE, HECK OF

>> **/u/N8theGr8** http://i.imgur.com/QehyjJc.png



> **6: Here's a difficult one: If you had to choose the rarest pupper you've ever seen, what pupper would it be?**

>>  **/u/The_Coolest_Sock** Hachikō

>> **/u/Librase** o heck. let me think. Gabe the doggo has a special place in my heart. RIP, fren

>> **/u/PM_ME_YOUR_IZANAGI** uh, probably this goodboye from the discord https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/273827411056001026/450706858051764234/image.jpg

>> **/u/siouxsie_siouxv2** rarest pupper was my old roommate's dog, a white dog with brown spots who was the sweetest and smartest dog ever. She died recently, we all cried

>> **/u/crazymunch** http://i.imgur.com/jx3QVoQ.jpg

>> **/u/2SP00KY4ME** That's like asking me who my favorite child is!

I'm going to be completely honest here, this feature is 100% biased. I have a little Border Collie of my own and he's the absolute best pupper I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with in my life, a perfect 16/10 pup. [Here] (https://imgur.com/gallery/uSGMnpE) are some pics.  He is the best dog in the world, just like every other dog out there. 

Anyways, enough ranting about my own dog. I could do that for a whole feature if I let myself (I'll save that for the comments :) (Can you use the brackets in the smiley face to end the opened brackets? Seems cheaty). Y'all already know what /r/BorderCollie is about. It's about the specific breed of dog, the Border Collie, AKA the sheepdog, AKA the super-smart-high-energy-hounds-of-love dogs. Call them what you like, they are absolutely excellent dogs. The sub itself is simply a sub about the dogs. There's lots of helpful advice on how to raise them (they are very energetic dogs and need a lot of outdoor activity), stories about their own dogs, and [pictures] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderCollie/comments/99d6li/i_went_for_a_run_without_her_yesterday_she_was/). [Lots of pictures] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderCollie/comments/8u1hda/arriving_at_the_park_vs_leaving_the_park/). [Very lovely pictures] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderCollie/comments/9tk8b6/fun_day_at_the_park_my_dogs_are_mine_and_my/).


There are many breeds of dogs, and they're all suited for different people. If you want a high energy, big dog that's super smart, the Border Collie is for you! But be aware that these dogs are very high maintenance. I've seen too many people with dogs that are frustrated and disloyal because of how little they get outside and get to, you know, be dogs. This applies tenfold to Border Collies. If you're interested on getting a dog, I would highly recommend checking out /r/BorderCollie!

/r/Dogs_Getting_Dogs was a subreddit I stumbled across about a month ago, in /r/Dogpictures. At the time it was a small sub, only a few hundred subscribers, a handful of posts. It was right at the time where I was drafting this Theme Week, actually. But I was scrolling through the sub, and I saw [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs_getting_dogs/comments/9ed6y2/xpost_old_dog_feeling_like_a_puppy_after_meeting/) post. I swear I've watched that gif at least 30 times. That gif was just so goddamn cute. It was at that moment, upon seeing that gif, that I thought to myself ""right, this is 100% going on that motherfucking Dog Week."" I instantly subscribed, modmailed the moderator for permission to write the feature, didn't get a response, asked to become a mod, became a mod, gave myself permission to feature my sub (#beatthesystem), and drafted this post. Moral of the story is, this sub is good and I like it.


If you haven't worked it out from the whole Dog Week thing and the name of the sub, /r/Dogs_Getting_Dogs is a subreddit for... Well, dogs getting dogs. Or cats getting cats, or domesticated pigeons getting domesticated pigeons, or whatever. It's a sub for animals getting new friends. Everyone likes getting new friends, animals included. So when a dog gets another dog, you get lovely reactions like [this one] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs_getting_dogs/comments/87e2az/old_goldie_getting_a_baby_goldie/). It is like 99.98% strength eyebleach material.

The subreddit is, admittedly, rather small, but already it's of very high (and adorable) quality. It has the potential to become one of the largest dog related subs out there. Everyone likes friendship, and this sub has *all* the friendship.

&nbsp;

With Christmas approaching, I'm sure there'll be many people reading this that are thinking of getting of getting a pet. Excellent choice, by the way! And for all those getting dogs... Well, this is Dog Week after all, so we'll be focusing on our little canine pals. In particular for this feature, puppies! Everyone loves puppies. They're so adorable and loving and cute and **aaaa*****rghomg they're so cute***.

As amazing as they are however, they're still essentially toddlers. Cuddly, face-licking toddlers that piss and shit all over the fucking place and bite everything. People often buy puppies, don't realise how high maintenance they are, and give them into shelters because they realise they don't have the time for them. And that just breaks my fucking heart.

Moral of the ~~ramble~~ story is, if you're going to get a dog, specifically a puppy, know what you're getting yourself into. The benefits and companionship you get are immense and definitely worth all the trouble it takes to raise and train one, but many can't handle them at the beginning. This is where /r/Puppy101 comes in. If you have any questions on getting a puppy, raising a puppy, teaching a puppy or anything about your puppy, this is the place to go! The sub is filled with tons of helpful advice on everything from [how to train your puppy] (https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/xzifp/eliminating_on_command_a_helpful_trick_while/) to [fixing behavioural issues] (https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/xz3t7/how_to_stop_nippingbiting/), and [everything in between] (https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/y0buw/on_the_importance_of_socialization_and_training/) too.

(I just noticed that all those linked posts here from the same user, so I think they deserve a specific mention; thank you /u/criticasartist, your posts are awesome and super helpful!)

&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/Whisgo** I finally got the puppy I always wanted! And a friend who was already involved in the puppy101 community suggested I check out the subreddit. So I did. And it all went uphill from there...

>> **/u/redchai** Not a particularly exciting answer - I got a puppy! My Standard Poodle Ramses came home in March 2017; I relied on this sub to keep me calm and sane for the first seven or eight months of owning him.

>> **/u/CallMeMrsSlender** I got involved maybe 2 years ago? Eleanor, my youngest of three dogs, was maybe 3 months old and I was new to the whole dog-subreddit scene. At the time the sub was at pretty rough it was just shy of being just another r/eyebleach, no moderator involvement, spam-loaded, and actual supportive content was far and few in-between. Then the founder chimed in and decided to ask for some new faces to re-do the entire subreddit and restore the sub to it's former advice-based, educational and supportive glory. So being on my third dog (and growing up with several others), working at a dog daycare and boarding facility that I now manage, I applied for the moderator position.


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/Whisgo** For the most part it's chill. The main thing is making sure folks are following our subreddit rules of engagement. We actively moderate vs passively for the most part - this means a lot of reading. It can feel a little overwhelming, but that's why we have a team to share the load and I'm so appreciative of that. So when life gets busy offline, I'm confident that the other mods are still here doing what they do best. Alternatively, being a puppy101 mod is a lot like being customer support in a way. I try to provide helpful information, direction to resources, encouragement to our users. Raising a puppy is hard! There's pros and cons - and puppy101 is a great support group of dog owners who have experience across the spectrum - from first time owners to experienced.

>>  **/u/redchai** Fun, challenging, educational. I learn a lot from my fellow mods and the experienced subscribers that help new owners. I agree with u/Whisgo
 that it can be draining at times. The nature of the sub is that our subscribers ""outgrow"" the community along with their puppy, so we have a steady influx of new people who are simultaneously thrilled, panicked and overwhelmed. I'm very thankful for my fellow mods and the core subscribers that are solid, reliable and ready to help.

>> **/u/CallMeMrsSlender** It's relatively calm! Initially we had a lot of workload changing the sub to a more current version, re-establishing rules, updating, adding to and creating articles for our wiki, learning how to effectively use Automod and our mod tools. Now it's nice. We are here to ensure fellow puppy owners new and old follow our sub's rules and get the best possible resources.



> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/u/Whisgo** My favorite posts are updates from owners who were having some tough times and after they find something that works, success is found. https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/9cfcp6/update_puppy_play_date_human_who_left_her_puppy/ is a great example - actually it's almost the most unbelievable story! But that happy ending is just wonderful.

>>  **/u/redchai** [I love this post from Monty's owners, who accidentally trained their puppy to only respond to the ""crate"" command when they say it like game show hosts. The video makes it even better.](https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/9aqiuo/the_story_of_why_we_sound_so_stupid_whenever_our/)

>> **/u/CallMeMrsSlender** My favorite? Oh goodness! There is a lot but the most recent one that really stole my heart was /u/budgiefacedkiller and her pup's struggle with distemper which she unfortunately lost. https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/8xe69r/distemper_pup_final_update/ We see a wide variety of posts from the inevitable puppy blues, frustrations over typical puppy behaviors, people over the moon proud and happy with their pups, some even at the edge of rehoming. This post or really the series of posts was just heart-wrenching, the love and care s/he wrote in the post was tangible and strong, they put their all into their puppy whether the out come was good or bad and personally I think we can all learn something from that.


> **4: What, in your opinion, are the best and worst parts of raising a puppy?**

>> **/u/Whisgo** Both the best and the worst is that you're responsible for the overall outcome of what your puppy will be as an adult. This is both gratifying and terrifying. As my own puppy hits her first birthday this month, I have enjoyed watching her grow and mature. Seeing her discover new things has been amazing. She's grown so much more affectionate with age - and as a puppy I was concerned she'd be far too independent to bond with me.


>>  **/u/redchai** The worst part for me is the worry. This probably (?) gets better when you have more than one puppy under your belt, but I've just raised the one, and the first year (and a good chunk of the second year) has been a lot of worrying - about his health, about whether we're doing the best we can for him, about whether whatever weird bad habit his has this month will be around forever...The best part is seeing your puppy grow into themselves. Ramses is such a delightful, quirky little goof, and it's made me want to raise another ten dogs just to see what weird stuff they come up with.

>> **/u/CallMeMrsSlender** The best for me is getting to celebrate all the small and large victories as they mature into an adult. Even a simple evening without accidents or when they 'graduate' from puppy class- that's huge and worth being excited about every step of the way. We tend to get hung up on the negatives due to the sheer stress, sleep exhaustion, the nipping, the accidents, and all the rough parts that come with puppies, we need to step back and remind ourselves of the good things and the tiny bits of progress we make day-to-day. The worst? The judgmental looks and advice passer-by's give. It may get a bit better once they're not puppies but some people tend to go way overboard with the comments and lack of awareness when a puppy is involved. Please remember they're only just babies and always listen to and ask their owners/handlers/parents when approaching a puppy- and maybe keep some snide remarks in-check?.


> **5: What tips do you have for anyone wishing to get a puppy in the future?**

>> **/u/Whisgo**  Know what you're getting into - raising a puppy is very time consuming and exhausting. You will not sleep for the first few months. I know some folks hate comparing it to raising a human, but at least with infants you might get time off work. I don't really know how I survived the first few months working a full time job - even though I timed the first week or so with a holiday break.


>>  **/u/redchai**  Learn the difference between having a puppy and having an adult dog. Adult dogs are great. So many people encounter some chill, well-trained senior dog and think having a puppy will be the same, but cuter. No. Wrong. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. You have years of work to go before your peeing, biting, yapping, needy puppy is that ideal dog. Read up on the puppy blues and be sure that the puppy experience is really what you want.

>> **/u/CallMeMrsSlender** I will keep it short since I've wrote a novel elsewhere! Research until you can't anymore- breeds, dog psychology, behavior; go and meet the breeds or get hands on experience with dogs similar (volunteering is great for this!); plan it all out but know it's going to change somewhat so plan loosely; check out options for grooming, daycares, boarding, pet sitters, walkers, even family support; keep all expectations low as you can- these are infants after all and it's our job to teach them gently, appropriately, and consistently.


> **6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/Whisgo** I don't really have plans. I'm a relatively new moderator to the sub and tend to defer to the other more experienced mods for subreddit plans.

>>  **/u/redchai** In addition to what the other mods have said, I particularly enjoy keeping up to date with the new features of the redesign and seeing what we can implement to make the sub more user-friendly.

>> **/u/CallMeMrsSlender** Plans? Maybe some new wiki articles, fine-tuning of automod sources, I see our chatrooms are doing wonderful so perhaps a new chat mod or two? We work collaboratively and as a team so we will see what comes up, what we believe is feasible and go from there.


> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/Whisgo**  My puppy got camper of the month this month at her doggy day camp. Is it really overkill to make a bumper sticker to announce this? hmm...

>>  **/u/redchai** Thanks for featuring the sub!

>> **/u/CallMeMrsSlender** Thanks for interviewing us!

Dogs are some extremely useful animals. They're one of the few (household) pets that have used outside of providing near infinite love and happiness (which they do *very* well). They can be used to herd animals, guide disabled people, and assist in police activities. They're also [excellent accountants] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/a69q0m/promoted_from_my_best_boy_to_best_office_assistant/), they can provide [commentary for sports games] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/9ia9vp/when_espn_had_air_bud_do_commentary_for_a/), and can even [serve you drinks!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/a25m6r/finn_bartends_when_hes_not_helping_my_sister_with/). Or, at least that's what /r/DogsWithJobs tells me.

/r/DogsWithJobs is a sub that featured all of the best, working dogs out there! It ranges from the actual real Dog Jobs to the nonsensical and silly. So you have a mix of the best pups doing things like [assisting police] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/a40azp/belgian_malinois_shepherd_helped_turkish/), [avalanche rescues] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/9zy91f/this_is_rocky_he_is_one_of_vail_mtns_avalanche/), [helping people testify in court] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/7v7lzs/i_would_be_so_proud_of_my_dog_if_he_got_this_job/), all mixed in with the [software developer doggos] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/7sd8cl/my_busy_puppy/), [shopkeeper dogs] (https://redd.it/8pz2rz), and the [questionably legal shopkeeper dogs] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/8doa9o/doggo_has_wares_if_you_have_coin/). It manages to stroke a balance between being a sub about really good dogs, and a /r/rarepuppers-esque sub, and ends up being extremely entertaining as a result. Combine this with an excellent modteam and wonderful content creators, and you have one of the best dog subs on the site!

**WARNING: This feature may be NSFP (Not Safe For Puppers).**  

There are some hecked up people in this world. Those people include:   

* People who don't clean the breadcrumbs off of the knife before getting more butter, contaminating the butter with breadcrumbs;   

* The absolute sociopaths who enjoy /r/PuppersHeckingDying.  
  
/r/PuppersHeckingDying is one of the most brutal subs out there, featuring the abhorrent content that exists. Just look at this poor little pup getting ViOlEnTlY mURdEreD. Truly, I'm scarred for life now.   
  
Nah, but if you can't tell (somehow), this sub is a joke. /r/PuppersHeckingDying is a sub based off of /r/PeopleFuckingDying, which itself is a parody of /r/WatchPeopleDie (warning: actually NSFL). It features poor little pups getting HecKInG dEStrOyEd in the most HorrIFiC of ways!!1!! Just look at [this brutal murder](https://www.reddit.com/r/puppersheckingdying/comments/6rg1av/pupper_crushed_2_deth_under_large_structure/) for an example! There's a wide range of content, all of it excellent and family friendly (the puppers don't like swearsies). While there may not be too much activity on the sub, all the activity there is high quality and entertaining. I like this sub for other reasons too though; my first ever feature for SROTD was actually /r/PeoplefuckingDying (when it was at the peak of its popularity), so it feels nice to finally feature its counterpart, after nearly 2 years of writing, managing and eventually becoming head mod. This sub is long overdue a feature, and what better time to feature it than in our Theme Week?  
    
> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**  

>> **/u/Mr_Gamer_Geek** Well I found a sub link to it that went nowhere, so I made an executive decision to make it real. Like its like a concentrated version PFD, that focus on puppers, its a void I thought I could fill. So I did.  
  
> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**  

>> **/u/Mr_Gamer_Geek** Relatively easy, everyone seems to be on board with the sub. Though I have to be candid, I'm not usually awake when the sub is active, /u/Br00ce & /u/ManlyJowe are there when I'm not so I not sure how the sub is sometimes when I'm not around.

>> **/u/Mr_Gamer_Geek** Wow now I sound like the worst person given the last question; I'm not a monster I swear, its just a job, it's something people need, a place to display the macabre, the brutal, to show the true nature of the world at large, a side many many not see otherwise.  

> **5: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**  

>> **/u/Mr_Gamer_Geek** Well I hope since I know have more time on my hands to try and keep the growth, as every sub. Source some CSS in, make this look nice, IDK. And just enjoy the sub and the community.

In fact, they're so goddamn amazing, that we here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay have decided to do an entire week dedicated to them!

* [Jake] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/62pe4w/pic_this_is_jake_he_reigns_puppy_terror_on_the/); a beautiful little pup.

* [2 little couch cushions!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/89yn64/when_you_dont_really_care_about_eachother_but_the/)

* [A loaf of bread, not really sure why this is even on the sub tbh] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/89daww/i_like_purebreads_and_everything_but_have_you/)


Now that we've seen some lovely little puppers (and some big old ones as well) we can move onto the sub itself, r/Dogs. The sub is the main hub for everything canine related in Reddit. If you have any questions about your dog, about getting a dog, training one, or just want to talk about your dog, this is the place for you!



&nbsp;

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** I joined about four years ago when I got my first dog. I was interested in learning more about dogs and it was a useful place to share and discuss experiences as a dog owner. I joined the mod team two years ago as I wanted to help improve user experience and ensure the sub was a decent place to be.

>> **/u/octaffle** I got my first dog and wanted to learn more about dogs and how to be a good dog owner. I became a moderator over 5 years ago to manage the Photo Friday posts. My role in the subreddit has evolved immensely since then but my goal is the same: educate others about responsible dog ownership and the realities of owning a dog. Increasing owner preparedness and awareness increases pet retention and reduces the number of dogs given up or abandoned while improving the quality of life for both the dog and the owner.


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** It has its ups and downs. Mostly, it’s pretty quiet. We have several automoderator functions so most days are a combination of approving posts, dealing with reported comments/posts and answering modmail messages. However, when something blows up it BLOWS UP and there’s not usually much warning. Posts can go from 0 to 200 comments in hours. That’s when we have to be much more involved, making sure that people aren’t breaking rules or slinging mud at each other.

>> **/u/octaffle** The ship steers itself for the most part. Most things that can cause problems require approval before appearing in the subreddit, so day-to-day is mostly approving posts. There are a lot of divisive issues in the dog community and when those topics pop up, moderating can be challenging.


> **3: What are some of your favourite posts from the sub?**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** Our [breed questionnaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/4qc6lb/meta_breed_questionnaire_updated_june_2016/)
 has gone through several revisions, but I’m really proud of it now. It’s a great way for our users to figure out which breeds suit the OP. It also prevents users from having to ask a billion follow-up questions to a post that just says ‘I rent and work full-time, what dog should I get?'

>> The [process of breeding a litter](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/43a578/discussionthe_process_of_breeding_a_litter/) is another one that comes to mind. It’s an invaluable write-up by one of our active breeders that lays out the highs and lows (and costs) of responsibly breeding a litter.

>> Occasionally we get a troll post that is really, really funny and I like those too. My favourite one ever was the one time someone started asking about the behaviour of their “chialian greyshire”, an apparently chihuahua/italian greyhound/yorkshire terrier mix.

>> **/u/octaffle** I find that our subreddit tends to have a bit of a serious tone so my favorite posts are when our users let loose and start to joke around. I also really like it when users talk about dog breeds that are rare or non-existent in the US.


> **4: What do you think is one bit of advice that every dog owner should know?**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** Choose the right dog for your lifestyle. It may not look the way you thought it would or behave the way you thought it should, but it will make you much happier than the dog you have in your head.

>> **/u/octaffle** The difference between dog breeds goes way beyond the way they look. I feel like most people think dogs are all the same except for how they look. Each breed of dog has different behavioral tendencies, needs, and desires. When the dog’s needs aren’t being met, the dog finds inappropriate outlets for those needs and drives. I encourage anyone looking for a new dog to take the time to read about breed tendencies and be honest with themselves about their ability to meet the dog’s needs. Plan for your current activity level, not one you hope to achieve. Also, if you want a purebred dog, you should start your search on the Breed Club website. Just Google “[Breed] Club of America” or whatever country you’re in.


> **5: What are some of your favourite dog related subreddits (besides this one, of course) that you'd like others to know about?**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** /r/puppy101 is an invaluable resource for new puppy owners. I've used it multiple times. /r/k9sports is also a good place for dog sport specific discussion.

>> **/u/octaffle** /r/whatswrongwithyourdog and /r/holdmykibble


> **6: Can you send pictures of your dogs? It's for science.**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** [These] (https://image.ibb.co/ee4WL0/threedogs.jpg) are my three nutcases: from left to right, Reuben the italian greyhound; Lori the whippet and Gatsby the whippet. I’m a sighthound addict.

>> **/u/octaffle** Of course. I have a 9.5-yr old Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Waffle and a 2.5-yr old Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever named Banjo. [Here they are dressed as Robin Hood and Little John]( https://66.media.tumblr.com/76db6966809240b7419678d04274c2fc/tumblr_op4ifgLYuy1r3qnbmo2_1280.jpg) at a Sherwood Forest themed Corgi specialty show. (A specialty show is a dog show but it’s just one breed of dog.) 


> **7: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** We would like to have an in-depth wiki at some point that delves into common questions and answers, but it’s such a huge job that it hasn’t gotten off the ground yet.

>> **/u/octaffle** Bare minimum: Stay the course. We’ve grown a lot in the very recent past and that’s not going to stop anytime soon. I want the subreddit to maintain its current level of quality advice and open discussion despite the increase in population.


> **8: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/Serial_Buttdialer** We’re a discussion-based subreddit and I think that’s really awesome. Users can post pics of their dogs on the Photo Friday post or if they’re relevant to a topic, but overall the sub is full of discussion, advice and debate - making it a lot more informative and fun than just straight-up pictures.

>> **/u/octaffle** I love the /r/dogs community and I am so grateful for all of the knowledgeable people that make our subreddit so great. I look forward to seeing the community grow and grow stronger.

"December 12th, 2018 - /r/PrematureCelebration: 500,000 Subscribers! What a milestone!",175,a5hxi7,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/a5hxi7/december_12th_2018_rprematurecelebration_500000/,6,"# /r/PrematureCelebration

~~**500,000**~~ **331,665** impatient people *getting their jollies too early* for **5 Years**

I can't believe it! Seven years ago, there's no way we could have predicted reaching the 500,000 subscriber count here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay, and featuring /r/PrematureCelebration as our 500,000th subreddit! It's absolutely fantastic to note that the PC team was ecstatic about the news too! Moderator /u/trai_dep was quoted as saying, ""I wonder if we can change the style of r/PrematureCelebration to hype [our victory], put a stickied post celebrating it, the whole yards. Basically, we want to give you as broad an easel as you like. I think we're all game."" And I think that's a fabulous way to think about it! So, to celebrate all the hard work everyone has done to get us to this point, let's look back on some crushing, and premature celebrations that made the sub what it is today. As far as I could dig, it seems that it all started with something so innocuous as [a Top 10 from the Sports Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prematurecelebration/comments/1gguxx/top_10_from_sports_center/) which has since been removed from Youtube. The community was small then, so few comments, and so much lost to time. 

Then we look at our [first ever featured subreddit, MovieMusic...](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/h14er/rmoviemusic_tracks_articles_research_videos_and/) back when /u/ProudGary led the charge. Accomplishing a feat such as we've done, managing to archive the [best, which happens to be us according to the top of all time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/5lf1uw/congratulations_rsubredditoftheday_you_are/) and [most controversial subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/wv6t2/july_20th_2012_rpopping_it_looks_like_spraycheese/) that this community has to offer has been no easy task. We've brought on and let go of writers, (I should know this is... I think, my third foray?) we've featured [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4g88p8/april_24th_2016_rtheredpill_a_look_at_what/) [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/7c8lec/november_11th_2017_rdebatealtright_where_the/) [really](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4hhey9/may_2nd_2016_rthe_donald_srotd_town_hall_an/) [shouldn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3s9wxp/november_10th_2015_rpunchablefaces_actually_its/) [be](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/5ckq6x/november_12th_2016_ryiff_nsfw_its_not_weird_if/) [visited](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/6wynbn/august_30th_2017_rpussypassdenied_you_shall_not/). The world has been our oyster, and I wanted to give the guys at /r/PrematureCelebration a little bit of that glory, that slice of history as we make our milestone of 500k today. It's been a blast writing for you all.

So, let's get a little introduction to PrematureCelebration shall we? Surprisingly, the subreddit features exactly what its name implies. People celebrating far too early, hyping their own success, only to find that they'd failed the hardest they could. A prime example was [a Chinese man who set up this really wicked proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prematurecelebration/comments/9sdqa0/itll_be_fine/) expecting that the lady he loved so much would accept... only to be told (in English no less) that it wasn't what she wanted. Or who could forget the classic moment when people were pranked into thinking that [our fight for net neutrality was over when it made it to the top?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prematurecelebration/comments/7eo0xe/we_did_it_reddit_we_saved_our_internet/)

All these laughable moments made me want to get in touch with the moderators to find out more from them about the subreddit, and I gave them a little context that they were being featured as our '500,000th sub' (hinting at them being the 500,000th subreddit to be featured. 

>#What prompted the creation of /r/PrematureCelebration?

>>**/u/trai_dep**: The creation of the r/PrematureCelebration was a happy accident. A dyslexic Mod, intending to create a therapeutic Sub for victims of premature ejaculation, typed out the name too hastily. It ~~shot~~ took off from there.

>>**/u/N8theGr8**: No idea. The creator of the sub went inactive. 

>#Why do people seem to always think that they're going to be successful?

>>**/u/trai_dep**: Like Sisyphus pushing his rock, a dog chasing a car or 6ix9ine buying face cream, it's not the outcome that shapes a person, but the struggle. And yes, that is a 'The Stranger' reference.

>>**/u/N8theGr8**: Hubris is the folly of man, and comes before the fall of all of us. Except for me, of course, I'm gr8.

>#How long do you think it would actually take to be featured as our 500,000th subreddit?

>>**/u/trai_dep**: FWIW, it will take Richter (and his 69 generations of family) 1,368.9 years to work through 500K days. Yes, that includes leap years. Or, do we want to suggest Richter is – how does one put this nicely – an unholy immortal abomination of the night kissed by the Dark Lord herself? Either/Or. Abominations are more fun at parties, for what it's worth. 

All in all, it's been a fantastic journey and... (^(what? zadoc, conal, what do you want? can't you see I'm--- wait what? what do you mean we haven't reached 500k yet? then what the hell am I--- goddammit.)) Okay... so, as it turns out, it seems I did a little premature celebrating of my own, as of this writing we've only made it to 460k, but we're definitely on the right track. Just a little bit longer and soon enough we'll be halfway to our own ~~gold play button~~ spot in the Reddit History books, who knows? Maybe we'll even end up being one of the auto subs for new users to the site? \*hint hint* 

I suppose there was question that I had left to ask the mods after the head mods approached me while writing this.

>#Were there any premature celebrations that you found so unbearably hilarious that you couldn't stop laughing? ^((Don't say this one, don't say this one, don't say this one.)^)

>>**/u/trai_dep**: Fellow Mods? A little help here? 

>>**/u/N8theGr8**: This one. And [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prematurecelebration/comments/78v2d5/one_year_ago)

**7,412** *smiling faces* for **6 Years!**


r/Joker is a subreddit dedicated to The Joker, Clown Prince of Crime, is Batman's arch-nemesis. An agent of chaos known for his malicious plots, wacky gadgets and insidious smile, he has caused Batman more suffering than any other villain he has ever faced. His origin, name, and true motivations remain a mystery.

We judge a hero by their adversaries. Sherlock Holmes has Professor Moriarty to give him a real run for his money, James Bond and Eric Stavro Blofeld, Nayland-Smith of Scotland Yard and Fu Manchu, Nero Wolfe and Arnold Zeck, Steve McGarrett and Wo Fat, etc. The Joker is compelling because he makes Batman compelling by giving him a worthy adversary.  An unpredictable agent of chaos who knows exactly how to push people’s buttons.that has captured our imaginations for decades. 

On /r/Joker you'll find Discussion, fanart, theories, trailers..etc everything you desire for your Joker needs! With Two current Jokers in the films and one in the TV show Gotham there is a lot to be excited about Joaquin Phoenix is currently filming a Joker Origin film. The Joker will unleash chaos in movie theaters in 2019. Warner Bros. has set an Oct. 4, 2019, release date for its standalone “Joker” movie starring Joaquin Phoenix. The studio made the announcement on Wednesday afternoon ahead of the start of Comic-Con With Todd Phillips at the helm!

There’s a reason why if you ask people who don’t read comics, to name a comic book supervillain, chances are they’ll say Joker – he’s become iconic and culturally vital enough to surpass his primary comic book audience. 

And. Here. We. Go!

**Here is a small taste of what you might experience when you visit /r/Joker**

*  [The Trump. Upvote this so that people see it when they Google ""Donald Trump"". ](https://www.reddit.com/r/joker/comments/62tcsr/the_trump_upvote_this_so_that_people_see_it_when/)

>>##What was it about the Joker that got you hooked on the character, do you have a favorite incarnation?

>>**u/HarleyQ** I've always found Batman's villains interesting, some are pretty quirky, but Joker just always stood out above the others. I'd have to say my favorite is the Mark Hamills from The Animated Series. 


>>##What do you think it is about the character that its able to attract such talented actors like Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, Joaquin Phoenix, Jack Nicholson..etc?

>>**u/HarleyQ** The Joker is a crazy character that I think lets an actor let loose more than they usually get to. You can laugh as loud as you want and be as crazy as you want, and no one will really go ""hey now that's TOO much"".


>>##What was your first thought when they announced a Joker Origin film, and how have the set photos grown on you?

>>**u/HarleyQ** I think I'd describe my feelings on the new movie as ""cautiously optimistic"" I WANT for it to be great, and I know what I personally would love for it to be but I'm trying to keep my wants in check so they don't cloud whatever the movie eventually becomes. I've liked the few make up clips they've released, they're very eerie for just being simple classic clown makeup.

>>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/HarleyQ** We're a smaller character sub, so a lot of what we get is fan art and cosplay when there's no new big Joker content, and I think those would be my favorites. As a cosplayer myself, I love seeing other people find ways to express their own love for characters. 

>>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/HarleyQ** The Joker is viewed in a lot of different ways by every fan of his. Everyone has their own favorite Joker and even two fans of the same version can love it for different, possibly even opposing reasons. I think this is a great thing because none of those fans are really ""wrong"" on what they believe the Joker is.

**1,225** subscribers, a community for **2 months!**  
  
/r/BigBlueGame is a subreddit dedicated to documenting the development process of an ocean-based horror survival game, with a specific focus on taking community feedback into account.  

#What Inspired This Game?  
  
Games have a unique ability to immerse the player far more than similar narrative art forms like writing or films. This makes them perfect for capturing complicated emotions like fear. I myself have an irrational fear of the open ocean, and I decided early on in development that I wanted to capture this same fear and share it with others. After posting a few prototype videos on different subreddits, I got several requests to make a subreddit. /r/BigBlueGame was created, ambiguously named “Big Blue Game” because I had no name for the project at the time.  

On it, I post regular screenshots and videos of features that I am developing, assets or models that I have made, prototype/concept art that I have drawn, and the occasional tutorial on how I've created some aspect of the game. I use feedback on these posts to shape the game as it it created.

#What's Special About The Subreddit?  
  
/r/BigBlueGame provides a unique and in-depth view into how a game is made. Not only that, but I certainly take user comments into account. The community is an equal part in the development of this game, and they have been providing me with feedback and ideas about the game’s development since day one. I've implemented several suggestions that I have received, and I have a large list of requested features that I am looking forward to adding.

#Why Should You Visit?  
  
Anyone with a fear of deep water or an interest in the process by which a game is made may find this subreddit to be a lovely resource. It's a unique opportunity to have input on a game as it is developed, and to learn about how an idea is turned into a real feature or asset in a video game.

**108,146** *Leviathans* for **5 years!**
 
 


/r/ImaginaryLeviathans is an image based subreddit dedicated to art featuring Leviathans. If you're wondering what the heck a Leviathan is, it's a giant creature of the sea or sky. According to legend, the Leviathan was a fire-breathing creature of such immense size that the sea boils when it swims on the surface. It ruthlessly and fearlessly rules over all the creatures of the sea. The Leviathan's skin is like a double coat of mail, with overlapping scales as large as shields on its back, and as sharp and hard as broken pottery on its under-parts. Swords and harpoons will simply bounce off such protection. It breathes smoke from its nostrils and flames from its mouth which is rimmed with teeth. Its fins radiate a brilliant light and its eyes are like the glimmerings of dawn.

The tale of Leviathan has been a source of curiosity among many Christians and non-believers alike since the inception of the creature was expressed in the pages of the Bible. Leviathan is known to be a fearsome primordial being that ruled over all other creatures of the sea. There are varying descriptions of the origins and intent of the creature in history – though most would agree that Leviathan is dangerous and capable of terrifying destruction.
 
If you're like me and got extremely hyped reading that and imagining these amazing creatures in your mind, imagine seeing what these insanely talented and creative artists are able to achieve. Coming on here is a real treat I marvel at how they're able to bring these epic creatures to life.

>##How did you find the sub and what made you want to moderate it?

>>**u/Lol33ta**My path to the INE started with a /r/SpacePorn post that linked to /r/ImaginaryStarscapes. From there, that handy dropdown menu led me to over a hundred other art subreddits, and there was no turning back for me! /r/ImaginaryLeviathans was an early favorite. I got so into it that /u/ethan_kahn offered to mod me. 

>##Do you have a favorite post on the sub?

>>**u/Lol33ta**This one has been my wallpaper since it was posted over a year ago. [Lord of Ocean by Mist XG](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/92YaQ)  

>##What do you think makes Leviathans stand out from the other INE subs?

>>**u/Lol33ta**_Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn._ Also, the content is amazing and has wider audience than some of our more niche subs. /r/ImaginaryLeviathans also benefited from reddit's free subreddit [ad](https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2y388/styles/image_widget_oenqoi7qkzv01.png) program for a while, which is where we gained hundreds of new subscribers daily. Once you get big enough, some of the posts start hitting r/All and that leads to a snowball effect of exposure and growth. This is now the INE's biggest sub and hopefully helps people discover other art subreddits they like.

Everyone here probably knows Smash Bros, it is one of the biggest franchises of Nintendo and the hit of every console generation. For me it all started with Brawl and while I did play Melee before I never really got into it. Brawl was my most favorite Wii game (besides /r/AnimalCrossing: Lets Go to the City [City Folk] but that is a topic for another post about them). I played countless hours on Final Destination with no items and 3 lives - As you can guess, yes, I'm a filthy tryhard that doesn't like the RNG factor of items and didn't enjoy playing on any map that had random events that could potential hard my raw S K I L L (I wasn't very good at Smash if I'm being honest).

 Later I bought Smash Bros 4 for the Nintendo /r/wiiu and had great fun with it - I mostly mained Kirby and had great fun. Talking about Kirby, do you know what just released, Kirby: Battle Roy....... uhhh, I mean, Smash Bros Ultimate (If you're reading this at a later date, that's great for you - I also wrote this like 1 month before release :P). In ""All of Kirbys friends are dead: The Game"" you have the biggest roster Smash ever had with fan favorites such as a plant, a little kid, a sexy witch lady or green mario. 

The thing I loved the most about Smash Bros Brawl was the story mode and while yes, it was boring and some points, the cutscenes were so amazing - It was completely unreal for me to see that my favorite characters combined to kill a god that controlled the god of their world till Kirby saved everyone again. Now guess what, Smash Bros Ultimate has that too! Welcome Kirby on the journey to kill god once again and save all his friends with awesome cutscenes that make you think about the fact that this could be the best movie ever made! You're asking me why I already know that Kirby will be stronger than god? It's easy, Kirby is god, Kirby is life and Sakurai loves his little Kirby. Seriously, if you have a Switch just buy the game to play this awesome game - Sakurai always puts his entire soul into each version till he literally dies and wants to quit for good (till Nintendo pulls him back in, poor guy).

The point where I'm going is that /r/smashbros will be the greatest Switch game and you should just buy it and look at the hyped crowds on that subreddit loving the game even more than I do. 

Anyways, [I can't wait to drop of the Battle Bus and meet you all in Smash Bros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZZvLrA2GXY)

Welcome to /r/lotrmemes, the place to shitpost all you want about Lord of the Rings, The hobbit, The Silmarillion and all other Tolkien related stuff. Here, we do not discriminate against memes, we accept them with open arms. 

Most people have heard of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, be it you have an interest in the fantasy genre and like me have read the books, or you just wanted to see the films because you thought they were just an action movie. Either way, what we can all agree on is that it's a damn good story which makes this sub even more fruitful. There is so much history and material from many different platforms. The wealth of material in an ever growing meme world its a great marriage. 

The community and mods alike genuinely enjoy these films.
The users are always very kind, always willing to answer any kind of question, even the most basic questions from people who have never read a single page of page or haven't watched the films. Its a very inviting subreddit which is one of the reasons I wanted to feature it, the other is I love the films and genuinely find the content to be  really funny. **On that note here are some examples of what you'll find when you visit /r/lotrmemes:**

>>##How has being a /r/lotrmemes/ mod changed how you watch the film when you rewatch it?

>>**u/ironchefchopchop** Now when I re-watch the movies I constantly see memes every other scene. And sometimes I will see a scene or quote and think.. ""That could be a meme""

>>**u/IRuinYourPrompt** Oh boy. When I first joined the sub back in March, the first thing I did was just rewatching the extended trilogy and make a mental note of scenes that could be used. It's something I always do when I find new meme subs, I did the same with /r/POTCmemes and /r/themummymemes. I wouldn't say it really ruined my immersion when watching Lotr, I've always been and still am deeply in love with the movies, but any person who likes to create memes will admit that they always have that extra bit of attention when watching. I often rewind famous scenes or scenes with interesting dialogue to see if it's possible to make a gif from that scene. But in the end, the Lotr trilogy are just so brilliant that it's impossible to just not rewatch them.


>>##How does /r/lotrmemes/ stand out from the other meme subs?

>>**u/ironchefchopchop** LOTR Memes stands out because the members of our sub actually enjoy the movies we are memeing. Unlike other subs we are not finding humor in how bad or stupid a movie or quote is but instead using these great movies and a platform to make jokes.

>>**u/IRuinYourPrompt** What many people don't know is that /r/lotrmemes is one of the oldest movie/serie-based meme subs out there being created over 6 years ago, but it only gained traction back in March after a crossover meme made the frontpage of /r/prequelmemes. It's been a slow but steady increase in subscribers since then and that might play a part in our content staying high in quality rather than having the new section being spammed by low effort posts. The people who join the sub have a real passion for Lord of the Rings and show it in their OC. Also, and I certainly don't want to call out any other subs with this, the fact that Lord of the Rings was so well written, had engaging dialogue and was brought to the screen so well by Peter Jackson definitely plays a role in why Lotr memes are on average of a higher quality. This is just my opinion though, others might say that this might be a reason Lotr is less suited for memes. One final thing that sets /r/lotrmemes apart from other meme subs (not all, just most of them), is our simple CSS layout (credits to /u/ironchefchopchop). It's easy to the eye, quick to navigate and fits the lotr-theme quite well.



>>##Do you have a favorite post that still makes you laugh?

>>**u/ironchefchopchop** One of favorite LOTR memes will always be Frodo saying ""Alright then, keep your secrets."" But there is just way too many good LOTR Memes to count.


>>**u/IRuinYourPrompt** There are quite a few posts I can clearly remember. A recent one by /u/luxurychoccie was top qualatte OC for sure. This precious gif by /u/PreviousReason pretty much summed up the Faction War we had in September to celebrate 100k subs. Taters by /u/gapil27 is for me the perfect crossover. Finally this one by /u/majorlicks certainly deserves a mention. There's tons more posts that I really liked, but the list would become to long I fear.

An American epic space opera franchise, created by George Lucas and centered around a film series that began with the eponymous 1977 movie. The saga quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. The film series has spawned into other media, including books, television shows, computer and video games, theme park attractions and lands, and comic books, resulting in significant development of the series' fictional universe. Star Wars holds a Guinness World Records title for the ""Most successful film merchandising franchise"".

With the amazing passion Star Wars fans have you can expect to find a ton of great art over here on /r/ImaginaryJedi. As a fan getting to mod this sub has been an absolute delight, everyday there is beautiful and inspiring art in my queue so I believe it will really brighten your day when you check your subscriptions!

It is the goal of the INE to share, inspire, discuss and appreciate paintings, drawings, and digital art while maintaining artist credit and source links.

>>##Which of the Star Wars films got you hooked?

>>**u/I_Burn_Cereal** My grandpa had me watch the Star Wars movies at an early age, so A New Hope is probably where I was first hooked. I was also like 9 when TPM came out and was pretty obsessed with it.

 >##Do you have a favorite character you enjoy seeing drawn the most?

>>**u/I_Burn_Cereal** I would say Darth Maul and Asajj Ventress as well as any space battle.

 >##What makes this subreddit stand out from the other INE subs for you?

>>**u/I_Burn_Cereal** I think because of the size of the fanbase, it's really cool seeing all of the variations of different scenes and characters from canon and EU. You don't have to look too hard to find some unique works.

At AntiMLM we are dedicated to resisting the worst business model capitalism has ever concocted. Multi Level Marketing scams take the thrilling heights of a pyramid scheme and hide behind the guise of ""small business owners"" ""direct selling"" often poor quality products to everyone they know. This is where MLMs ruin families and friendships. If a business incentivizes you to turn everyone you know into a customer, you are going to lose money and damage relationships along the way—which is what most victims of MLM scams experience.

Our sub is full of success stories from those who have kicked or resisted MLMs, sad tales of ruined family finances and relationships, and great evidence of direct action against MLM advertising schemes.

[This is a classic post where a user wins a bet when her long lost friend contacts her](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/9rm96b/i_took_great_pleasure_in_this_havent_seen_this/)   

[Here is a fresh post where a user hides the MLM marketing material they find in a doctor's office.](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/9rhqqv/found_a_whole_stack_of_mlm_brochures_in_the/)  

[Sometimes the numbers don't lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8c9fo6/llr_dream_863_profit_with_50k_in_sales/)

Of course our community comments are always great for advice, encouragement, or lols. [Here is a top comment from a post where an MLM is tearing apart a marriage:](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/9rd8ha/mlm_wife_ruined_our_life/e8fzuvp/)  So many of these people wrapped up in victimizing new recruits are themselves being victimized by their upline.

We are trying to do our best to stop the MLMs from commercializing our relationships.

Provide three or so paragraphs to describe the sub. Include links to exceptional content that can be found on the sub. This will be the feature post. [optional]:

Interested in the writings and philosophies of Confucius, Laozi, Mencius, or Mahayana Buddhism? What about the great imperial histories of China, Korea, and Japan, or the stirring poetry of Li Bai, Su Dongpo, or Li Qingzhao? Maybe you've heard of the martial epic Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which the great heroes of Shu, Wei and Wu battled it out for supremacy over the Central Plains. What do all of these have in common?

All of these great works were written in **Classical Chinese**, the standardized literary form of Chinese that predominated during of the Common Era and served as the literary lingua franca in historical East Asia. Though the official written form of Chinese has since been replaced in the twentieth century by vernacular Mandarin, Classical Chinese retains its status as a highly influential language that greatly affected the vocabulary and linguistic trajectory of the modern Sinitic languages, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Though the language's name, ""Classical Chinese"", may make it seem like it's similar to modern Chinese, it is in fact arguably more different from modern Chinese than Latin is from Italian.

Our subreddit r/classicalchinese is a community for discussing and analyzing the Classical Chinese language, especially its historical corpus of texts and poetry. Community members share useful resources, interesting translations, and personal or academic projects that they're working on. Anyone interested in the literary and linguistic history of China and East Asia is welcome to join us!

Crohn's & Colitis Awareness Week is December 1-7. We're the largest, most active subreddit dedicated to helping those who have IBD, Crohn's, or Colitis, as well as their friends and family. Crohn's and Colitis are both inflammatory bowel diseases that often have major impacts on people's lives. Symptoms often include severe abdominal pain, bloody stool, and frequent & urgent bowel movements, sometimes as many as 30 per day. Unfortunately, due to the subject matter a lot of people don't like to share their struggles with this disease, so most of the world doesn't realize how severe this disease can be. It also gets confused with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), which can usually be treated with over the counter medications and diet modifications. IBD treatments are more on par with cancer treatments, requiring infusions and sometimes surgeries to remove portions of the digestive tract. In certain instances, chemotherapy drugs are prescribed.  
  
December 1-7 is Crohn's & Colitis Awareness Week and we're here all year long to support those who have it as well as those who don't — it can be just as difficult for our friends & family! Stop by if you have any questions or if you just need to vent to people who understand. We're number one at number two!

/r/halsey is a subreddit dedicated to the artist Halsey (Ashley Frangipane) from New York.

The New Jersey native took her moniker from a New York L train subway stop and her adopted city plays a large role in both the sound and lyrics of her gritty, dark electro-pop. Based on the strength of her first single, ""Ghost,"" she signed a deal with Capitol-owned electronic/dance label Astralwerks in early 2014. Her debut EP, 'Room 93', arrived in October of the same year. Her debut album 'Badlands' was released in August 2015 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Four singles were released from the album, all of which achieved minor commercial success. 

Halsey rose to prominence with ""Closer"" (2016), a collaboration with The Chainsmokers, which topped the charts in major music markets. Her second studio album, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (2017), consisted of more ""radio friendly"" music than her prior releases. It became her first album to top the US Billboard 200, and generated the single ""Bad at Love"", which became her first top five entry on the Billboard Hot 100 as a lead artist. Outside the music industry, Halsey has been involved in social activism, including suicide prevention awareness and sexual assault advocacy.

 Over here on /r/halsey, you can find everything from Fanart, Music, Photo's, fan moments, theories, and just overall discussion. It's a growing community but a very energetic and passionate one, I just recently got into Halsey but I found coming on to this subreddit was a really nice time and would highly recommend giving it a visit.

>>*The sad thing is, this is the only life for some people, they can't pull it off in reality, so they think they can get some ""Internet Respect"" by cussing at people on Myspace, Youtube comments, or a forum, they think by doing this, people think of them as a Badass.*

>>*internet badass: ur just lucky i can't get to you!*

Lets face it if you spend enough time on the internet you're bound to come across them. /r/iamverybadass is dedicated to showcasing those people trying too hard to appear tough, strong, brave, heroic all from behind their keyboard. 

Like Caleb McEwen asked back in 2008 in an article about it, ""Why is it that on the internet, everyone is a badass? When people are typing, why do they use ten times the number of exclamation points their real-life speech patterns actually necessitate? Why will people viciously attack individuals and points of view they would never even question if confronting them face to face?"" The simple answer? Anonymity.

While /r/iamverybadass/ aims to poke fun at these ""Internet Badasses"" don't get it twisted one of the main rules is Remove personal information (including reddit usernames, even your own). Public figures are fair game. Unlike some of these users the intent is not to harass others but to give you the best of the internet in one place. Come visit and cringe along side other awesome users at the 4th degree black belt in jiu jitsu, karate, Kickboxing. Muay Thai. Lethwei. Sanshou. Savate...etc

>>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/tilnewstuff** Because of the many cringe-inducing internet comments bragging about how tough they are, how they could beat up Bruce Lee and Muhammad Ali and Jon Jones and Mike Tyson. These people require a reality check. We are the Jim to the world's Dwights.

>>**u/tilnewstuff** I loved that one guy who, after an online argument, made threats against me and peppered his post with a winky face, to show how confident and in control he was. There was a winky face after every few words, from beginning to end. I can't quote all of it but the first part was something like this:

>>"";) Hey ;). You think YOU ;) can mess with ME ;) and get away with it? ;) THINK AGAIN BUD! ;)""

In /r/thisiscomfortable you can find animals that are comfortable, in uncomfortable positions. If you have ever had a pet, or seen one, that is very comfortable, while in the most uncomfortable position, this would be where you post it!

There can only be a post with a picture, or a video, no text posts. You are not allowed to post images of animals in actually comfortable positions, hahaha! I suppose if they are on an uncomfortable surface, in a comfortable position, that should be allowed. While the the Thisiscomfortable community is still growing visiting this sub will definitely bring a giant smile to your face. Its absolutely stunning what positions these animals can fall asleep in!

The SubReddit has a cat in the main image, however, /r/thisiscomfortable is for every animal cats, dogs, birds,..etc. If you do not even own the animal, or found one from a different sub, and posted it, that is alright!

/r/PostMalone is a subreddit dedicated to Past Malone. Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995), known professionally as Post Malone, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. He has also gained critical acclaim for blending various musical genres, for his introspective songwriting, and his laconic vocal range.

Born in Syracuse, New York and raised in Grapevine, Texas, Malone began his musical career following the release of his debut single ""White Iverson"" in 2015. The song, which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and later certified quadruple platinum, allowed Malone to secure a recording contract with Republic Records later that year. Malone released his debut studio album, Stoney, in December 2016, which debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 and was soon certified triple platinum. The album also enjoyed generally positive critical success, and contained the top-ten singles ""Congratulations"" and ""I Fall Apart"". His second album, Beerbongs & Bentleys, was released in 2018, and featured the singles ""Rockstar"" and ""Psycho"": both would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while the album opened at number one on the Billboard 200. It also broke several streaming records and was certified double platinum.

On /r/PostMalone you can find everything from Songs, theories, discussion posts, videos, even some truly amazing Post inspired Halloween [costumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMalone/comments/9sjzvq/howd_i_do/) here [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMalone/comments/9sh5pi/im_just_another_girl_who_dressed_up_as_post_for/) a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMalone/comments/9s3hp0/my_post_malone_costume/) that [made](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMalone/comments/9s3h90/best_costume_ive_ever_done/) me [smile](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMalone/comments/9qghxj/9_year_old_girl_post_malone_for_halloween/) the [most](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMalone/comments/9q04zh/happy_halloween_yours_truly_austin_post/)!

>>##What was it that first got you into Post Malone?

>>**u/ItzzBlink** I heard White Iverson and really liked it, but I never gave his mixtape a good listen. Then I was on /r/hiphopheads and saw the Stoney release thread and for some reason wanted to listen to it first (J Cole released his album the same day). I was absolutely blown away. It was the first album I had listened to in a while where I couldn't skip a single song. Then I started getting really into him after I saw his [Rage Against the Machine performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxsNk_DXplo) which [I heard Bill Burr talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iURK_HDFYQY).

>>##Have you ever gotten to go to one of his concerts?

>>**u/ItzzBlink** Yes! I was super bummed that I missed the first concert he had near me so I vowed to go to the next one no matter the price. It was honestly one of the best concerts I've ever been to.

>>##What's your favorite song from him?

>>**u/ItzzBlink** This is such a hard question so I'll have to cheat and give 3. In no order: ""Yours Truly, Austin Post"", ""Too Young"", and ""Rich and Sad.""

>>##How has being a mod on here affected your fan experience?

>>**u/ItzzBlink** My friends got annoyed with how much I talked about Stoney when it released so it's really nice to be able to talk with people who won't get burnt out talking about Post all day!

>>##Anything Else you'd like to add?

>>**u/ItzzBlink** If somehow you haven't heard of Post, you should definitely give him a listen. He's got a bunch of different styles so I'm sure you can find one you like. Links to his projects are in our sidebar.

>>Thank you to /r/subredditoftheday for choosing us

The /r/TitansTv subreddit is for discussion, news, fan content, and shitposts related to DC Universe's 'Titans'
 Titans is an American web television series that airs on DC Universe, based on the DC Comics team of the same name. Akiva Goldsman, Geoff Johns, and Greg Berlanti created the series, which sees Brenton Thwaites star as Dick Grayson / Robin, the leader of the Titans, alongside Anna Diop as Starfire, Teagan Croft as Raven and Ryan Potter as Beast Boy. Titans premiered on October 12, 2018 and is set to comprise 12 episodes. Ahead of the series' premiere, Titans was renewed for a second season.

Brenton Thwaites was cast as Dick Grayson in September 2017, and other series regulars were cast between August and October 2017. In May 2018, the spin-off series Doom Patrol was announced, which will pick up after the events of Titans. For more about the DC Universe Streaming service please check out /r/DC_Universe. 

The premise for the season is ""When Dick Grayson / Robin and Rachel Roth / Raven require assistance to deal with a plot that threatens the entire planet, they join forces with Koriand'r / Starfire and Gar Logan / Beast Boy to form the Titans.""
 As a huge DC fan *(yeah shocker)* so the idea of them doing so much with the streaming service has me excited. Visiting this sub I'm sure you'll enjoy catching up on the latest episode discussions. Seeing everyone's reactions good or bad is something I look forward to every week the show is on. Whether its a shit post, discussion, theory, fan creation, multiverse..etc there is never a dull day on this sub.

**32,380** *Subscribers* for **9 Years!**

/r/BlackFriday is a subreddit dedicated to Black Friday, Black Friday is an informal name for the day following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, the fourth Thursday of November, which has been regarded as the beginning of the country's Christmas shopping season since 1952, although the term ""Black Friday"" did not become widely recognized or used until the early 2000s. Most major retailers open very early, as early as overnight hours, and offer promotional sales. 

Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe ""The Day After Thanksgiving"" as a holiday for state government employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday, such as Columbus Day. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off, which, along with the following regular weekend, makes it a four-day weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers. 


 I know you're thinking why feature them on Thanksgiving instead of on black Friday, well I want you guys to be able to experience what the sub has to offer in time to actually put it to use, because over here on /r/BlackFriday you can find big sales and deals. This includes cyber Monday and other deals throughout the year that companies market as ""black Friday style"". So as you get ready to go out and find your perfect  TV, Laptop, Video game, appliance....etc 

Just make sure that you don't step over too many people to get it! Happy Hunting!

>>**Do you remember your first Black Friday memory?**

>> **/u/Tommarkasu** going with my father at 3 in the morning (back when BF started on Friday) to wait in line to get the free door prize from JC Pennies. Which was a Mickey snow globe that my mother wanted. Now, I’m typically done with BF shopping at 11pm on thanksgiving! What a difference.
 
 
>>**Have you ever experienced one of the nightmare Black Friday moments in person?**

>> **/u/Tommarkasu** I’ve been at a 24 hour Walmart when the “announcement” that BF sales were now active. Pretty, neatly wrapped pallets of merch became what I’d imagine a victim of a zombie outbreak looks like. People tearing into plastic to get to the goods underneath. Total choas for a cheap 32” TV.

>>**How has Black Friday changed over the last few years?**

>> **/u/Tommarkasu** Black Friday has merged with Cyber Monday and has become more of a week long, maybe even month long, event. Early access and online sales happen all of November. Over the last 5 years it’s changed from an early riser’s event to a night owl’s event as stores open during Thanksgiving dinner now.

>>**What is your favorite thing about being a moderator for /r/Blackfriday?**

>> **/u/Tommarkasu** I enjoy it because I only have to really be a mod for 2-3 months out of the year. Our sub dies (hibernates?) for most of the year, then BOOM! Lots of activity. Also I like figuring out how to keep the would-be scammers at bay, not an easy task. Gotta try to keep people safe!

Tomorrow is Thanksgiving in the United States, so I thought it would be the perfect time to feature the sub! /r/Thanksgiving is a subreddit where you can discuss, share recipes, photos, videos, traditions, tips..etc about Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in Canada, the United States, some of the Caribbean islands, and Liberia. It began as a day of giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year. Similarly named festival holidays occur in Germany and Japan. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October in Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States, and around the same part of the year in other places. Although Thanksgiving has historical roots in religious and cultural traditions, it has long been celebrated as a secular holiday as well. 

For many Americans, the Thanksgiving meal includes seasonal dishes such as roast turkey with stuffing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie. The holiday feast dates back to November 1621, when the newly arrived Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Indians gathered at Plymouth for an autumn harvest celebration, an event regarded as America’s “first Thanksgiving.” 

You might be thinking howcome you featured it the day before Thanksgiving, I just wanted to give you guys a chance to experience the sub and get some last minute inspiration or advice before the big day! Hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and if it isn't Thanksgiving for you hope its a great day!

They can never pour a liquid, their hands seem to be covered in butter or oil because everything they touch slips out of their hands. /r/wheredidthesodago/ highlights great moments from those commercials, takes them out of context and ads amazingly hilarious captions.

/r/wheredidthesodago/ started from [a post on /r/funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11vonv/oh_no_it_poured_right_into_the_glass_like_it_was/c6q2vv3/?context=5)

If you're every in need of some unexpected hilarity then this is a great way to waste some time. When you read the title you never know what kind of gif is going to accompany it, and they never disappoint.

Lets here from the Mods of /r/wheredidthesodago!

>**1. Whats it like moderating the subreddit?**
>>**/u/Camsy34** Moderating here at wdtsg is a blast. I joined the team back in 2014 and moderating alongside these guys has been lots of fun. Given how specific our posting requirements are, there's not a huge work load, which was a nice way to ease into reddit moderating for me. A downside to the job is how often we have to pull content for the sake of keeping the subreddit focused on what it set out to be: a place for whacky infomercial gifs. Seeing our oddly specific content reach to the far corners of the internet is really rewarding.

>>**/u/-eDgAR-** I was first added here back in April 2013. It was the very first sub I became a moderator and I was very eager and excited. They added me because I contributed quite a lot back then and also seem to have a good understanding of the rules. I learned the ropes of what it meant to be a moderator here, which has helped me be a great mod to many other communities. It's been a lot of fun over the years, my favorite thing was when [we as a team recreated famous gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wheredidthesodago/comments/2jj0kq/october_22nd_is_our_twoyear_anniversary_so_to/) to celebrate 2 years as a sub. Overall though, it's a pretty laid back sub to mod since we only get like 1 or 2 posts a day.

>**2. What are some of your favorite posts?**
>>**/u/Camsy34** Am I allowed to say my own? Haha. I love the posts that are creative with their titles and think outside of the box. A couple of favourites: https://redd.it/4ci42d, https://redd.it/4o3hxb

>>**/u/-eDgAR-** My favorite post has to be [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wheredidthesodago/comments/2j7ma9/wear_two_glasses_to_appreciate_that_your_daughter/cl99o5t) by Camsy. The reason is because we not only had one, but two of the actors show up in the comments. That was so awesome and we tried to set up a week of AMAs with them and other infomercial talent we knew, but sadly they never got back to us.

>**3. Have you ever bought any products that you've seen on infomercials?**
>>**/u/Camsy34** I actually have! I bought one of those hoses that expand when you use it and shrink up when the water is turned off. It lasted two weeks before it broke horribly. Would not recommend. A success though was one called dropstop, it's this flexible material thing that you put over your seatbelt buckle in the car and it stops things from falling between the crack in your seat. I've had it for four years and it still does it's simple job perfectly.

>>**/u/-eDgAR-** I owned a HandyStitch in college which helped me repair a few things, but I didn't buy that directly from an infomercial.

>**4. What do you want to say to your current and future subscribers?**
>>**/u/Camsy34** I'd just say thank you for being a part of our community, by posting, sharing, upvoting or even just sharply inhaling through your nose at our content, you're making our efforts worthwhile!

>>**/u/-eDgAR-** Thank you all for making this such a great sub. It's hard to believe this community has grown into the 1 million of you guys, but it makes me proud. Keep seeking that soda!

>**5. Anything else you want to add that people should know about your subreddit?**

>>**/u/-eDgAR-** Remember, shipping and handling are not included.

/r/ColorizedHistory is dedicated to high quality colorizations of historical black and white images, and discussions of a historical nature. Growing up I always saw black and white photos of historical events, portraits..etc so coming across this subreddit has been a joy to see these photographs in color.  

The shear beauty that gets posted on here consistently is one of the major reasons I believe you should check out this subreddit. Especially since these photographs were originally shot in Black and White its amazing how well these submitters are able colorize it. Part of why this subreddit is so consistent and the quality is so high is because that its restricted its posting abilities to those who know what they're doing. You just have to respect a subreddit that strives for quality over quantity.

Seeing these photos in color really humanizes it but at the same time adds to the sense of larger than life and grandeur, I truly believe this sub will be a great addition your subscription list and wont regret seeing these photos on your timeline! 

**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/Captain-Cliche** I joined after gaining experience colorizing over at /r/colorization. I think I'd been doing it about a year, at which point I took a few months off, and then I returned and received some mentorship from /u/zuzahin and /u/mygrapefruit, which is what really elevated my work from amateur-quality to professional. Soon after, the gang invited me on the page, and the rest is history.



>>**u/Captain-Cliche** We can afford to be lax, most posters come here in good faith and, while there are debates, they usually stay civil.* Our philosophy here is to let the community decide what's acceptable, and that has mostly worked for us. It helps that we only ever have to moderate comments, since posting is invite-only.

>>*civil enough to not nuke

>##What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>>*[](/OTK)
*u/Captain-Cliche** Hmmmmm tough question... I'm a big fan of most of /u/Ruzden 's work, I feel it's very colorful and lifelike, and some of the most lifelike work on the sub.

>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/Captain-Cliche** I'm mostly hands-off with this sub nowadays. As I said before, the community here is pretty good at self-moderating except in fringe cases, and there's no need to monitor other mods' posts. I think right now we just plan to keep on an even keel; why fix something that's not broken, you know?

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/Captain-Cliche** Subscribe! Quality posts are coming from this sub all the time, and the discussions and history in the comments section are often as good as the parent post. I also want to give a shout out to /r/colorization, as this sub wouldn't be possible without it. And if you're looking to try something new and challenge yourself, head on over there and give it a try. You might even end up on ColorizedHistory down the line!

**11,951** avoiding a symbol for **27 months!**  
   
/r/AVoid5 is a subforum in which folks avoid that symbol that sits amid ""D"" and ""F"" (known as a ""fifthglyph"" on this sub for its position in our ABCs). Anybody can post about anything as long as that fifthglyph is totally missing. Although it calls for a lot of skill, you can grow familiar with this way of typing and start unconsciously using it in day-to-day talking. (And following writing this bit of this post, I naturally had synonyms in my mind for changing out words containing fifthglyphs and swapping in words without!) 
  
#But why shun that glyph?  
  
That fifthglyph is far too common among our vocabulary, barging its way into so many words. It looks almost ""too big to fail"", but, by avoiding it, all of us can show that it isn't. On top of this, now a subforum is glorifying this fifthglyph by randomly bolding it [(at this link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmboldenTheE)! Why, you ask? Just to start a silly fad, hoping it will catch on. But, not long ago, /r/AVoid5 outdid this silly sub in folks subscribing, proving that skill trumps a vacuous fad.

In conclusion, if this post and /r/AVoid5's aim stir your curiosity, visit this sub and try!

It is predicted that in the upcoming few days, the YouTube channel T-Series will overtake PewDiePie in subscribers. This is not entirely surprising; T-Series surpassed PewDiePie's view count on February 14, 2017. T-Series may have conquered YouTube, but PewDiePie still has more Twitter followers, Instagram followers, Facebook likes, and a subreddit too!  
   
PewDiePie has a series in which he reads posts from the /r/PewdiepieSubmissions subreddit. Although it was just created as a convenient place for fans to upload content for the series, the sub has gained a lot of community. They have birthed many memes (such as ""EAT THE KID""), and post memes from elsewhere on his channel such as [Bonus Meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/8rx73z/bonus_meme/) and [399 (great price!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/7oic2f/s_stands_for/). There has also been some ***drama.*** In December of 2017, PewDiePie started calling the Reddit series ""LWIAY"" (Last Week I Asked You), which is a very cool and original name. In response, Jacksfilms started a series in February of 2015 called ""YIAY"" (Yesterday I Asked You). It is quite frankly disgusting that Jacksfilms not only stole PewDiePie's content, but he stole the entire series idea over two years before PewDiePie even started it. A good thing that came out of Jacksfilms' heinous plagiarism, however - the [memes](https://i.imgur.com/YlXgCOF.jpg). The [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/9p8919/this_little_9_yr_old_is_wearing_pewdiepies/), [many](https://i.redd.it/snuxrwwpthk01.jpg), [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/7sgk76/top_10_anime_battles_of_all_time/).
  
To conclude, T-Series may soon have more subscribers on YouTube, but at least PewDiePie has a subreddit. And a very cool one at that.

DC's Legends of Tomorrow, or simply Legends of Tomorrow, is an American superhero television series developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, Andrew Kreisberg, and Phil Klemmer, who are also executive producers along with Sarah Schechter and Chris Fedak; Klemmer and Fedak serve as showrunners. The series, based on the characters of DC Comics, airs on The CW and is a spin-off featuring characters introduced in Arrow and The Flash along with new characters, set in the Arrowverse, the same fictional universe.

Time Master Rip Hunter goes rogue after Vandal Savage murders Hunter's family. Intending to stop Savage, Hunter recruits a team consisting of Ray Palmer / Atom, Sara Lance / White Canary, Martin Stein and Jefferson ""Jax"" Jackson, who combine to form the hero Firestorm, Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl, Carter Hall / Hawkman, Leonard Snart / Captain Cold, and Mick Rory / Heat Wave. They discover that the Time Masters are backing Savage in his domination of the world in 2166 to facilitate a successful repulsion of a Thanagarian invasion. Due to Snart's sacrifice, the Time Masters are destroyed.

In my opinion this is one of the most exciting of the Arrowverse shows since it's able to do a lot more wild things than the other shows I highly recommend visiting the sub. While the Shitposts are the highlight of all of the DC CW shows you will want to be involved in the Sticky'd episode discussion posts they are an absolute blast!

The fourth season premiered on October 22nd on the CW! Check it out and come on over to the subreddit and join in the fun!

>##What got you into the show and made you want to moderate the sub?

>>**u/mitch06_11** I got into the show through The Flash. I had been watching it since the start, and when I heard there would be a spin-off I knew I was gonna have to watch it. Since then it’s become one of my favourite shows. That’s why I wanted to be a moderator here too, because it’s one of my favourite shows and I wanted to be able to help out in a community full of people who enjoy the show as much as I do.



>##What separates Legends of Tomorrow from the other DC shows on the CW?

>>**u/mitch06_11** I think what separates Legends from the rest of the DC CW shows is that it’s got a much lighter feel to it. It feels more like an action comedy than a superhero drama. Plus there’s 100% more Beebo in Legends than in any of the other shows.



>##What's your favorite thing about the community?

>>**u/mitch06_11** My favourite thing about the community is how nice they are. If you like Legends and you’re a nice person, then the community will be very welcoming. There a few really funny people in there too. We get some quality shitposts every now and then. 



>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/mitch06_11** I really like [“If Eobard is from the future and Damien is from the past, does that mean Merlyn is.......”](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfTomorrow/comments/5rdjqa/if_eobard_is_from_the_future_and_damien_is_from/?st=JN9KNXUI&sh=0334ebd7).

**85,669** *Love Arrow S2* for **6 years!**

/r/Arrow, a subreddit about the comic-book series on CW. Discuss anything and everything about the show here.

Arrow is an American superhero television series developed by writer/producers Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Andrew Kreisberg that is based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow. The series premiered in the United States on The CW on October 10, 2012, with international broadcasting taking place in late 2012. Primarily filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Arrow follows billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), who, five years after being stranded on a hostile island, returns home to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. 

The series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although Oliver Queen/Green Arrow had been featured in the television series Smallville from 2006 to 2011, on the CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. Arrow focuses on the humanity of Oliver Queen, and how he was changed by time spent shipwrecked on an island. Most episodes in the first five seasons have flashback scenes to the five years in which Oliver was missing.

The sub has many great features but hands down the best posts have to be the shitposts. Everyday there seems to be a brand new one that surprises the hell out of me and makes me laugh. If Shitposts aren't your cup of tea then you'll enjoy catching up on the latest episode discussions. Seeing everyone's reactions good or bad is something I look forward to every week the show is on. Whether its a shit post, discussion, theory, fan creation, multiverse..etc there is never a dull day on this sub.

The seventh season premiered on October 15th on the CW. Check it out and come on over to the subreddit and join in the fun!

**31,355** *Kryptonians* for **4 years!**

Supergirl is an American superhero action-adventure television series developed by Ali Adler, Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg (the latter two having previously created Arrow and The Flash) that originally aired on CBS and premiered on October 26, 2015. It is based on the DC Comics character Supergirl, created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino, and stars Melissa Benoist in the title role. Supergirl is a costumed superheroine who is Superman's cousin and one of the last surviving Kryptonians. The series is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe. 

This was the first of the Arrowverse subs I had the opportunity to become a moderator on so getting to feature it is exciting. It's probably my favorite out of all the shows because Melissa Benoist is such a wonderful Supergirl. The sub has a ton of awesome features like Sticky'd episode discussion threads, fan created content, shit posts..etc 

I highly recommend checking out the sub, but when an episode discussion thread comes out its a must click because the hot takes, jokes, theories, and reactions are extremely entertaining. This sub has a really nice community who's pretty excepting to newcomers as well as veterans. 

The fourth season premiered October 14th on the CW! Check it out and come on over to the subreddit and join in the fun!

/r/Riverdale is the official subreddit for CW & Netflix's Riverdale. 

Riverdale is an American teen drama television series based on the characters of Archie Comics. The series was adapted for The CW by Archie Comics' chief creative officer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions and Archie Comics. Originally conceived as a feature film adaptation for Warner Bros. Pictures, the idea was re-imagined as a television series for Fox. In 2015, development on the project moved to The CW, where the series was ordered for a pilot. Filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The series features an ensemble cast based on the characters of Archie Comics, with KJ Apa in the role of Archie Andrews; Lili Reinhart as Betty Cooper, Camila Mendes as Veronica Lodge, and Cole Sprouse as Jughead Jones, the series' narrator. The cast also features Madelaine Petsch as Cheryl Blossom, Ashleigh Murray as Josie McCoy, Casey Cott as Kevin Keller, Charles Melton and Ross Butler as Reginald ""Reggie"" Mantle and Vanessa Morgan as Toni Topaz. Other characters in the series include the parents of the main characters: Luke Perry as Fred Andrews, Mädchen Amick as Alice Cooper, Marisol Nichols and Mark Consuelos as Hermione and Hiram Lodge, and Skeet Ulrich as FP Jones.  

This subreddit boasts a passionate community and set of moderators who work hard to keep it running smoothly and the quality of life on the sub as high as possible. I found the show on netflix, pretty much binged the entire first season in one sitting, you can say I really enjoyed it. So as a redditor I looked it up and found the sub. I'm more of a lurker on here but it really is such a good time seeing people connect over this show. 

If you haven't gotten to watch the show yet its on Netflix so its easily accessible for most people and the

>##What got you into the show and made you want to moderate the sub?

>>**u/PhoOhThree** I used to reach Archie Comics when I was younger so I decided to give the show a try and after the first episode I was hooked! I was moderating iZombie at the time and reached out to the sub to offer my help. Great to see the community and the show grow so fast!

>>**u/McIgglyTuffMuffin** For as long as I can remember I've been a fan of Archie Comics. I grew up reading the Digest magazines. I grew up watching both the live action and animated Sabrina the Teenage Witch shows. I grew up with the Josie and the Pussycats film and watching the old show on Cartoon Network.

>>More or less my entire life I've been surrounded by these characters. If I was on vacation and didn't have a Digest magazine I wasn't really on vacation in my mind. I didn't care if it was an Archie Digest, Jughead or Betty & Veronica Digest. As long as I had one I was content.

>>So when this show got announced I followed it in preproduction pretty closely and watched all the different forms it took. I'm not really sure exactly how it happened, we're on season 3 now and I've been here since before 1 started, I believe. I think I was browsing one day and there was a post asking for mods and I said ""let's go for it"" 

>>**u/heartsandribbons** I love mystery series and also grew up reading Archie comics. The sub was really active and fun back when I first joined during season one, and it was nice to engage with users who had nostalgia as well. I offered to help with the theme and flairs for the sub when there was a mod opening. 



>##Before you got into the show were you into the Archie Comics?

>>**u/PhoOhThree** Yup, used to read a lot of Archie Comics back in the days.

>>**u/McIgglyTuffMuffin** See the above answer, but heck yes I was and I still am. 

>>**u/heartsandribbons** I used to read them a lot, a childhood friend got me into them. 



>##Who is your favorite character on the show?

>>**u/PhoOhThree** Definitely Archie Andrews. People may forget that he always make the dumbest decision but he's still a teenager, we have all made stupid decisions back when we were young. Also he lives such a wild life in Riverdale. From school choosing from Music & Football to solving a murder, working with the MOB and Nu FBI Agent to getting arrested. 

>>**u/McIgglyTuffMuffin** Cheryl Blossom has my heart and always will. 

>>**u/heartsandribbons** Juggie 




>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/PhoOhThree** I love seeing fan made products/cosplays regarding the show. The most recent post of a redditor's Son as Chuck Clayton is the cutest! https://redd.it/9o5git

>>**u/McIgglyTuffMuffin** I've enjoyed most of the stuff Cole himself has posted. He just pops in and boom AMA is going on. Or the one time he posted some photos he took of the cast during the course of filming season one. It's always real cool to get that sort of perspective. 

>>**u/heartsandribbons** I personally love the live discussion threads for the episodes, the user comments are hilarious and make the show more fun to watch.

>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/ElusiveMonty** I already write for the[ Marvel Non Canon Universe subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelsNCU/), so I figured I’d try out for the big leagues of superhero fan fiction. Being a part of groups like this is exactly what writing should be - making fun stories just for the fun of it. And befriending other writers has been a great experience.

>>**u/MajorParadox** I had the idea for a while: Basically, make a version of Superman that incorporates my favorite qualities and interpretations. From there, I thought maybe I'd branch out to Batman and even find other people to join in. It came up in conversation with u/SqueeWrites [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MajorParadox/comments/47mwdz/marvel_dc_academy/d0e744t/?context=3), and we ended up starting out with several r/WritingPrompts mods, eventually branching out to new writers along the way!

>>**u/duelcard** DCFU looked really cool to be involved in, and explore (in-depth) the stories of our fellow authors! 

>>**u/FireWitch95** Because the nerds were only going to write superheroes, and we all need a little naughty in our lives.

>>**u/CapQX** I am a superhero nerd and aspiring writer, so this is the most natural desire to be displayed. Plus, I enjoy the psychological side of the powers of [Doctor Fate](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/doctorfate#icon-fate). Can we truly be good if we just focus on order? Plus, I get to bring a new, younger feel to a bunch of heroes in a combination that's brand new.

>>**u/UpinthatBuckethead** Because I love to write, and I love the characters. Hal Jordan has always struck a chord with me - [Green Lantern](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/search?q=flair%3A%22Green+Lantern%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all), the greatest force of will in the universe. He can do literally anything when he sets his mind to it, and so can we when we put the pen to paper (or fingers to keys, I guess.)

>>**u/PatrollinTheMojave** Well because I frikkin' love writing and nerd stuff. I was searching for some comic book subreddits and stumbled across that. A ton of hours later I had read some great books and was thoroughly hooked. After a sabbatical from Reddit, I decided to throw in an application.

>>**u/fringly** u/MajorParadox had been thinking about doing a shared universe, he asked u/SqueeWrites and me if we were interested in writing with him and I loved the idea. I'm a big [Batman](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/search?q=flair%3ABatman&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) fan and I loved the idea of a new take on the character, not beholden to any past continuity. 


>##Can you define your subreddit in one sentence?

>>**u/ElusiveMonty** A group of imaginative writers living out the dream of creating our own stories for our favorite characters.

>>**u/MajorParadox** ""Stories of your favorite DC characters written collaboratively and following a consistent timeline!""

>>**u/duelcard** Fun, collaborative stories of DC Characters.

>>**u/FireWitch95** We're better than all the movies, and half of the tv shows too.

>>**u/CapQX** All the fun of comic book superheroes in a different format, giving the reader the power to come up with the images.

>>**u/UpinthatBuckethead** A fun, budding universe with many as-of-yet unexplored adventures and twists  

>>**u/PatrollinTheMojave** It's what plants crave!

>>**u/fringly** When Reddit's best writers decide to do the DC universe... their way!

>##Do you have an all time favorite post on the sub?

>>**u/ElusiveMonty** I also have to admit the second issue of [Teen Titans](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/teentitans#icon-teentitans) written by AdamantAce has been one of my favorites. It’s the first part of a little storyline of MNCU’s New Warriors meeting DCFU’s Teen Titans and it’s very well written. Made me love Garth as a character for sure. 

>>**u/MajorParadox** So hard to decide on favorites! Pretty much any story where our characters cross over with each other (it happens a lot!) As for what I've written, I loved [Superman #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/4vm3tm/superman_3_around/) because it was the first crossover we had (when Superman meets Batman). If I can add one more, it'd be the [Mxyzptlk](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/815knk/superman_22_who_is_mr_mxyzptlk/) issue, because it was so silly and a lot of fun :)

>>**u/duelcard** Any of the team-ups, like [Justice League](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/events#wiki_justice_league), [Minutes to Midnight](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/events#wiki_minutes_to_midnight), etc.

>>**u/FireWitch95** Everything that has [Harley](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/search?q=flair%3AHarley&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) in it (duh) 

>>**u/CapQX** The feeling of absolute chaos and desperation made me love the [Minutes to Midnight](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/events#wiki_minutes_to_midnight) event.

>>**u/UpinthatBuckethead** My favorite post was actually a recent one, written by /u/AdamantAce featuring the [Titans](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/titans#icon-titans) and Marvel’s (you heard that right) premiere New Warrior, [Nova](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelsNCU/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ANova). The issue is action-packed and very character driven, and he knocked it out of the park.

>>**u/PatrollinTheMojave** [Teen Titans #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/6hfamd/teen_titans_1_all_star_origin_part_one/) definitely! I've read it way more times than anything else and actually looked to it when I started writing for r/DCFU

>>**u/fringly** That's too hard, the stories are ongoing and interconnected, which is the real joy of them. Our recent [Doomsday](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/events#wiki_minutes_to_midnight) arc was fantastic and a real highlight.  


>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/ElusiveMonty** I’m a new recruit so I just hope to write a good series for fans to enjoy for now. My characters aren’t even heroes yet but I hope to see them teaming up with the larger titles in the future.

>>**u/MajorParadox** We plan to keep r/DCFU going for as long as possible. We have years of story ideas planned, the biggest problem is gaining readership and fans (hint hint ;)

>>**u/duelcard** Drowning it...in upvotes ;)

>>**u/FireWitch95** Now, that would be telling. But I hear wedding bells and baby cries

>>**u/CapQX** Putting a shock to your system.

>>**u/UpinthatBuckethead** You know. Cosmic space wars, the usual. Cough set 33 cough

>>**u/PatrollinTheMojave** Explosions, theft, betrayal, roguish types, red stuff, government bureaucracy, and some Egyptian dude. Oh my!

>>**u/fringly** We're covering old and new stories and taking the characters to places that they've never been. We're already one of the largest ongoing single shared universe writing groups on the internet and one day we'll be held up as the gold standard for fan fiction. 



>##Anything else you'd like to add?

>>**u/ElusiveMonty** You deserve [ice cream](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DazzlingJealousIcterinewarbler-size_restricted.gif). Go get some.

>>**u/MajorParadox** If you want to find out more, check out our [welcome post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/9apwgg/welcome_to_the_dc_fan_universe_dcfu_start_here/). And we even have [a welcome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkOspd0ZKwg&feature=youtu.be)!

>>**u/duelcard** Does Aquaman control the airspace over his oceans?

>>**u/FireWitch95** Harley rules and Batman drools!

>>**u/CapQX** Can we truly have order without chaos? Or even the other way around? Ask your local philosophy major today!Can we truly have order without chaos? Or even the other way around? Ask your local philosophy major today!

>>**u/UpinthatBuckethead** “Hal Jordan, Green Lantern.

>>“Strongest willpower, bright light.

>>“Guy Gardner sucks ass.”

>>-Hal Jordan attempting an example haiku for Kilowog and Tomar-Re, circa 2018) 

>>**u/PatrollinTheMojave** If you like unlikable people for some bizarre reason like me then read [New Suicide Squad](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/newsuicidesquad#icon-ss2). I love feedback so feel free to tell me you love it or its hot garbage. ( : 
 

>>**u/fringly**  New readers shouldn't feel intimidated - all the character books are stand alone, so pick one you like and give it a go. After that, see what you like next. You can also jump into most and get caught up fairly quickly.

**3,189** *Reddit Connoisseurs* for **9 Months**!

&nbsp;


What happened, /r/BestOf? You used to be such an excellent subreddit. You were filled with the top quality content that Reddit had to offer. Excellent stories, jokes, landmark posts of the times, it was truly the Best Of Reddit you had. When did it change? When did ""Best Of"" turn into ""Trump bad, give upvote""? Most of the posts there these days are just bashing US Republicans. That's not /r/BestOf. That's a circlejerk on par with what they have over in /r/Gaming. I'm not angry, /r/BestOf, I'm just... Actually no, I am angry; nobody wants to see those types of posts in a subreddit meant for the Best of Reddit. It's stupid that the mods allow them when 75% of the sub doesn't care for them. There needs to be an alternative to /r/BestOf that isn't shit. And that alternative is /r/BestOfNoPolitics.


/r/BestOfNoPolitics should be self explanatory; it's /r/BestOf, without the ~~bullshit~~ political posts. The posts from /r/BestOf are automatically posted there, where they are then pruned, first by a simple filter, then by the wonderful mods, removing any political posts. This essentially means that it's of the same quality as /r/BestOf, just without all the political bullshit that nobody cares about. This also means that you don't have to worry about the sub being smaller then /r/BestOf. Overall, there's no reason to choose /r/BestOf over this sub in terms of post quality. If you want to see the best that Reddit has to offer, but are tired of seeing the same 15 posts over and over explaining why [insert Republican here] is bad and should be fired/impeached/jailed, then /r/BestOfNoPolitics is the perfect subreddit for you!

*Picture in your mind, a young woman. She's about 27 years old she's an elementary school teacher, a wife, a devoted mother. When she finally gets some time for herself she likes to spend it on reddit looking up random things whether it be /r/aww, /r/Frugal, /r/writing or in this case /r/DIY (*""Do it yourself""*) projects that can influence her next project she has her students make, some general house hold improvements what have you.* 

*One day after finishing an attempt at one of these DIY projects she feels great about herself her family loved it so now she wants to share it with the community that inspired it. She takes her camera and sets it up all nice and takes some photo's, comes up with a genuine title for it and sends it off into the ether and goes to bed.* 

*The next morning she eagerly checks to see how people have reacted to her work, she's met with a small humble response that make her happy she wasn't expecting much, but then she noticed above her post it says (*Other discussions*) confused she clicked only to find that another user uploaded the photo with a sarcastic title and it got 40k upvotes.* 

*What was she to do, What could she do? At the time she was out of luck*......  but nowthere is a sub that she could turn to. She could take that user to /r/KarmaCourt and  

/r/KarmaCourt is a satirical subreddit where grand entrances and long-winded monologues are welcome, and malice is not. KarmaCourt is the people's place for processing karma abuse and karma injustice, for calling out the imposters and karmacriminals-
BUT, and we must make this absolutely clear, only if it´s funny. Funny? Yes, funny. Well really ... isn't it hilarious the way we feel affronted when somebody has photoshopped a pic but claimed it as real? Isn't it funny the way people will argue over upvotes and downvotes? Put on your best fake righteous indignation and come and do some fake justice.

We don't have any effect outside our sub, at all. But we do solve a lot of arguments*. People like arguing in a structured environment. Even mods. We´re more healthy than downvoting, and funnier than that lot over there.

Because the other way of looking at KarmaCourt is that we are a theater, legal is the theme, and it's your turn to stand up and be on stage. Try it. It's fun, and you get to be part of karma history.

There was nobody around in those days and we just did it to kill time. He still owes money. There was the case of [""The People Of Reddit vs. Bo Burnham""](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1dguww/the_people_of_reddit_vs_bo_burnham/) if you like celebrities in the mix, and of course about hundred cases agaist /u/Gallowboob. That guy is such a target for the poorer disgruntled karmawhores that we either had to open a karmacourt embassy in his sub to cut down on paperwork or we had to mod him. So we modded him. It was easier. Gee that pissed people off. There were another 20 cases just about that. We removed them because they totally missed the point of the sub. Then of course there was the whole OJ fiasco. That went real wierd real quick. In the end we had to dress it up so it looked different on camera.

>>**u/HrBerg** My favorite was reddit vs. 1 percent of reddit (in which I was prosecutor) for the hoarding of the majority of karma. It's lighthearted cases like that which are the best one for KC and get a healthy, happy, non-controversial discussion going.  
 

>>##Have any of you been taken to Karma court or are you exempt because you're moderators of the sub?

>>**u/Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad** Countless times. Countless. We aren't exempt. We just have massive advantages compared to the common redditor not in the law circuit, and we park way closer to the door.  

>>**u/HrBerg** I think once a while back? The 'justices' (mods) have been sued as a collective a few times, but it's mock court and everyone gets over dumb decisions in a day or two.  
 
 

>>##How hard is it to mod this sub and what are some of the difficulties that come with it? 

>>**u/Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad** Oh it's easy. Our user base is a good crowd of people who would rather laugh and hold fake trials than get annoyed at the everyday scum of reddit behaviour. The problems are the people that don't look at the sub first and come here with serious complaints about karma inbalance. Can you imagine? It brings the tone down, but can get quite funny. Even then, from a mod perspective it's easy. We don't have mods. we have Jsutices and our gavels are heavy and bouncy. 
 
>>**u/HrBerg** The difficulty of moderating mostly flairs up when dumb fucks bring politics and shit into a satirical sub, or when people think that KC is a legit recourse and use it to direct anger towards a specific user.
 

>>##Since there is the rumor that /r/karmacourt is slated to become the next Judge Judy, which lesser TV judges will you go after first. The Peoples Court or Judge Mathis? 

>>**u/Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad** Nah they're all fake. Judge Judy tried to come after us but her crew couldn't get passed the parking attendant. Being the real thing, we get our share of the lights; [The Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/karma-court-reddit-doge/), Forbes, The Financial Times, the whole Thanos thing with [Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/thanos-subreddit-member-ban-karma-court/), [Moviedash.com](https://www.moviedash.com/news/4199/thanos-trial-reddit-karma-court/) and [ComicBook.com](https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/07/12/-avengers-infinity-war-thanos-karma-court-reddit-unbalancing-mur/), also The Whitehouse Twitter crew, Daily Catheter and stuff like that.

"November 8th, 2018 - /r/Aromantic: When you like people, but not like-like them, ya know?",170,9v9s02,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/9v9s02/november_8th_2018_raromantic_when_you_like_people/,8,"#/r/Aromantic

**3,104 readers** for **6 years!**

Let me begin, dear reader, by sharing the [definition of ""aromantic""](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Aromantic_FAQ#What_does_aromantic_mean.3F) provided by AVEN, the [Asexual Visibility and Education Network](https://www.asexuality.org/):

> An aromantic person is someone who doesn't experience romantic attraction. There’s no need for an aromantic to pair up with another person for romantic reasons. Aromantics are capable of feeling love - platonic love such as that between a mother and child or best friends is still love. Aromantics do have emotions, we are not cold or heartless people. Aromantics can have squishes. Aromantics may or may not enjoy acts such as holding hands or having candlelit dinners or cuddling. They just don't have romantic feelings towards the people they do them with. Aromantics may or may not desire to be in a long term relationship with another person (or several persons), however these relationships would be platonic from their side.

I am an asexual/aromantic, commonly shortened to ace/aro on places like tumblr and my lawn, wherever the damn kids tend to be. Like many people such as myself, I didn't innately know this about myself. I assumed that I was merely broken and outside warranty, but in reality, bad luck was the real enemy all along. I've dated both men and women and never quite felt correct with any of them. The closest I ever came was in what's called a [queerplatonic relationship](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Queerplatonic), or as most would think to call it, a bromance with extra steps.

Before we go too far, let me make something clear: I don't speak for anyone but myself. Your experiences may vary.

To be honest, I didn't know there was an /r/Aromantic for the longest time. I see my attractions and desires and the lack thereof as an absence rather than as a trait. I lack something that others have. It's an ongoing debate, I'm sure, but for this reason, I don't seek out others like myself for much the same reason that I do not seek out people who lack two heads and writing skill. It's only been in the last couple of years that I've felt any desire to speak to ace and aro people as I came to know the sadness that is that loss. I doubt most would agree with me, but many could, that this longing can be a kind of hurt. No matter who you are or what you like, we all have a desire for companionship. That's something I want to talk about.

The aromantic/asexual communities tend to bond around that concept as each of us understands in ways that others can't what that lacking does to people. More accurately, we never knew what it was like to not have it. Some get caught up in the loss, they get angry. Some pretend. Some relax.

I was angry at myself, once, and pretended. In a society where sex and romance have seeped to all forms of media, it can be hard to forget. I see a lot of people in the same state as I used to be in, a lot of confusion, and people without answers. There's doubt, and although /r/aromantic lacks the answer to the individual, it helps the individual reach the answer. There is no greater teacher than a former student.

Come chat on the Discord server (found in the sidebar), or ask some questions. Or, if you prefer, ask them in the comments. I can't speak for anyone but myself, and myself being a poor man to speak for, but I'll do my best. You can also join the SRotD Discord, this time in our sidebar, and yell in my direction with voice technology. You know, like in the movies.

I love you all. Just not love-love.

C'est votre super meilleur ami, Xavier Mendel, qui a signé.",1541682054.0,2018-11-08 14:00:54

/r/SplitFaced is an image based subreddit, have you ever seen a face that's been distorted because it was printed on the corner of a box, building, billboard, bus, etc.? Well, that is what this sub is about!

As a moderator of /r/CrappyDesign, I was getting frustrated with all the posts of faces on the corner of boxes. We get a lot of those posts over there. So, originally I created the sub to redirect those type of posts to their own sub.

As it turned out, the posts are funny and the sub is becoming more and more popular. I've had fun with it and hope to keep the sub growing.



**Here is a small taste of what you might experience when you visit /r/SplitFaced:**

*  [Umm What](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitFaced/comments/9723vf/umm_what/)

*  [This bus ad](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitFaced/comments/96sm8k/this_bus_ad/)

*  [was told she needed to be here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitFaced/comments/9j5mm5/was_told_she_needed_to_be_here/)

>>##Has moderating this sub made you look at advertisements differently when you're out in public?

>>**u/howardkinsd** The content made me look at advertising differently, but not really moderating the sub. The favorite part of modding the sub is response I get from people that find the content entertaining and funny.

 >##What's been your favorite part of Modding this sub so far how has the community come together?

>>**u/howardkinsd** The community came together mostly from comments in r/CrappyDesign directing people here. However, as the sub grew, word of mouth seems to be a big part now.

Explain Like I’m Middle Management /r/elimiddlemanagement is a very young subreddit inspired by ELI5 that aims to answer questions in the style of a corporate middle manager. The idea came from a comment in a thread about an article about the president of Interpol. Somebody asked for an explanation of what the day-to-day duties of that job are, and the answer they got sounded like it came from a “random business speak generator”. The sub was born then and there!

On ELIMM, questions are answered using as much office jargon as possible, with phrases like “synergy” or “touch base”, or anything else that sounds like the type of buzzword you’d hear in a large company or see on a LinkedIn profile. You could say that we try to leverage different synergies to dive deep into the granular details of questions posed by our stakeholders, then provide holistic and robust solutions to their pain points.

The culture and themes of the sub are still developing, but questions aren’t currently limited to corporate life, [one of the highest rated posts right now is about sex.](https://www.reddit.com/r/elimiddlemanagement/comments/9lo8l5/elimiddlemanagemt_sex/)

The answers that have been given so far have been hilarious and creative, and it would be really exciting to see what else we come up with in the future.

NoNutNovember is a concept parodied off of NoShaveNovember in which many test their willpower against masturbating. We acknowledge that in the days of the internet and easy access, many have grown a dependency on masturbating in place of finding productive outlets. We hope to encourage self-analysis and positive tips to break this dependency and allow those who take the challenge, even if they don't succeed to learn something about themselves.

The subreddit has, in my surprise, grown to nearly 10,000 in just a few short days thanks to the very active and engaging users who encourage eachother and share the word. Hopefully it continues to grow, even in the off months, and creates an even wider net of positivity for next year.

The subreddit at its face is a bunch of memes, but deep down you can find those who have accepted this dependency and take on the challenge in hopes of pushing the past the physical urge 

**Here is a glimpse at what you'll find when you visit /r/NoNutNovember:**

**1,813** posting in mass quantities for **21 days!**  
   
r/MassQuantities is a subreddit dedicated the vast sorts of amounts preferably in the ""holy shit that's a lot of (insert thing here)"" range. We bring together a community of people who find pictures, videos, and discussions about ANYTHING, as long as it's large in number and preferably SFW. Whether it be organized or disorganized, it doesn't matter. You saw a flock of a thousand crows flying over a field with two thousand pumpkins? Here's where you post it. You have a video? Good! Videos are basically just a MassQuantity of pictures. Just like how a picture is just a MassQuantity of pixels.     
  

>##1. Why did you create the subreddit?   

>>**/u/ligmabowlingballs**  The sub started as a joke stemming from [the comments section on a question I had posted on r/findareddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/9nxivw/a_subreddit_dedicated_to_the_appealing_nature_of/). With the advice of starting my own sub after nobody could answer me with a type of sub I was looking for, I said fuck it a joke haha sure why not. I woke up and it's starting to not look so much like a joke anymore but something serious so I would like to learn how to handle it in such a manner.  

>##2. What is the community and content like?  

>>**/u/ligmabowlingballs**  The community and content so far have been absolutely wonderful, receptive, supportive and encouraging. We've only had one poop in the pool incident so far but only 1 user had to be banned out of almost a thousand? Those facts speak for itself. Positivity and fun and bullshit and just a place to distract yourself from any type of stressors in your life. Trust me. Looking at large quantities of things is VERY relaxing. Try it.  

>##3. Why does someone need to visit this sub?  

>>**/u/ligmabowlingballs**  You need to visit this sub to view, watch or discuss community submitted content to mentally satisfy all that psychological in your head shit. It's just addicting. Flip through a few things you'll see what I mean. It's not a mess like you'd think. It's actually very relaxing and calming.

Whether you believe in reptilians or not is irrelevant. This subreddit is for reptilians by reptilians. For generations we hid underground and wormed our way into political bodies. But now, as the new millennium dawns, we can finally shit post ourselves into power.

Whether its memes, or just general complaints about the way the warmies function or taste. This subreddit provides a 100% authentic lizard experience, bridging the gap between our two species. You can expect memes, even stories and maybe even some interesting reptilian questions.

If you're looking at this and you're a reptilian, then join your brothers. If you're only dinner human, then why not join as well, it'll be interesting to hear your opinion and we promise not to manipulate you into walking into a feeding frenzy and getting DEVOURED...

r/bookexchange is the (un)official book exchange of Reddit :) You could swap for physical (and some digital copies) of books, you could do trade books for something, you could give books to a stranger in the internet and the most overlook word here is the Beg part, I know some user who begs for books gains down vote whether in comments or post. If you are subscribing r/books, you should subscribe to r/bookexchange next. Sharing is caring. 

While r/bookexchange has been on the decline for the last few years, it's true, but this is very likely due to the lack of community and active membership. The core ideals behind it are being revamped, there's a new mod team on deck and we're ready to go! We'd love to hear from you and love to have you share your love for books and stories in general.

We'd very much like to see the community grow and become more active. I myself (/u/RealReciever) originally joined in order to increase how much I read in general, I found a book-club through the sub, full of wonderful, kind people. Frankly, I hope everybody who joins has a similarly pleasant experience. :)

Since today is October 31st it only makes sense we feature  /r/Halloween, the subreddit dedicated to Halloween, obviously.  This subreddit provides everything related to this holiday! Ask questions and suggestions for costumes or scary music, share stories and pictures: everything is there! 

Halloween or Hallowe'en, is a celebration observed in a number of countries on the 31st October, A spooky day full of decorated streets and spookily dressed children! Trick-or-treat or sit behind the TV and watch horror movies or Halloween episodes of your favorite television show, there is always something to do. 

Halloween has always been my favorite Holiday, there is just something about this time of year that makes me happy. I have had some wonderful memories growing up Trick-or-treating with my parents then later on with my friends as I got older. As I've gotten older I've longed to scratch that Halloween itch by going to festivals, watching horror films, my favorite Halloween the last few years was getting to see Rob Zombie in Hollywood on Halloween it was just magical!

>>I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no, uh, conscience, no understanding and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six year old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes.

 
/r/Halloweenseries is a subreddit dedicated to the American horror franchise that consists of eleven films, novels, comic books, merchandise, and a video game. The franchise primarily focuses on serial killer Michael Myers who was committed to a sanitarium as a child for the murder of his sister, Judith Myers. Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois while being chased by his former psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis. Michael's killings occur on the holiday of Halloween, on which all of the films primarily take place.

The original Halloween, released in 1978, was written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, and directed by Carpenter. The film is known to have inspired a long line of slasher films. Most recently Halloween 2018 came out on October 19th Set 40 years after the original film, the plot follows Laurie Strode as she prepares to face Michael Myers in a final confrontation when he returns to Haddonfield, Illinois, after his killing spree on Halloween night in 1978. Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle reprise their roles as Strode and Myers, respectively, with stuntman James Jude Courtney also portraying Myers. The film also stars Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, Will Patton, and Virginia Gardner. 

I remember watching Halloween so much as a child that I pretty much wore out the VHS tape, I have so many cherished memories watching it. The last few Halloweens I even went to Pasadena where they filmed it and drove down the streets. If you're into these films or want to get into them I highly recommend checking out /r/Halloweenseries  this is an extremely passionate fan base I hope to see grow bigger!  






**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

On October 28th, Czech Republic is celebrating 100 years since the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918 following the end of World War I. This is a huge milestone for us and to mark the one-hundredth anniversary, hundreds of cultural, social and sporting events are taking place throughout the year that highlight the period known as the First Republic, that is, the twenty years between the First and Second World Wars.¨

In r/Czech, we discuss the current events and news happening in our country, help tourists or expats fell in love with the cities we are living in and we help other Redditors find their missed connections or learn the language. We are a bunch of helpful, maybe slightly dark-humoured people, wanting to talk with you about any matter. So Czech us out!

 /r/linkinpark is a community revolving around the band Linkin Park, a modern rock band that has many songs of many genres. The subreddit, along with the rest of the LP community was rocked in 2017 when the lead singer of Linkin Park (Chester Bennington) died by suicide. Despite the loss of one of the most influential people in LP, the community and LP have continued on, using it as a stepping stone to build something bigger. 

You can find without fail hundreds of tributes and honors to Chester, all created by fans on this subreddit, who have talents in creating song covers, artwork, and more The subreddit also has discussions about music both by LP and other similar bands, and opinions on albums or concerts. Overall r/linkinpark is a great community with very talented redditors and a great source of content.

**Here is a taste of what you might find when you visit /r/linkinpark**

>##What got you into Linkin Park?

>>**u/LinkinPlayground** I stumbled across the song Castle of Glass on Youtube a few years ago. That song grew on me a lot and I slowly started looking into the rest of Linkin Park's discography. This music got me through some of the lowest points in my life and it's made me a loyal Linkin Park fan for life.


>>**u/Todogo** I was, admittedly, a late bloomer and got into the band around the MTM era. I was never that into music until I heard What I've Done, which led me to explore their other stuff. Thanks, Transformers.


>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/LinkinPlayground** I joined r/LinkinPark because I wanted to find people to talk to about LP's music. I didn't have any friends in my life who had the same music tastes as I do.


>>**u/Todogo** I joined back in like 2012 because the sub didn't have a theme at the time. I made a post of a CSS proposal and they added me to the guys. I guess those nerds forgot to remove me./s


>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/LinkinPlayground** Probably megathreads for new releases. I really like revisiting those after a while. Fun to see how public opinion of the music changes after a some time has passed.


>>**u/Todogo** I know it might be kind of lame to say it's something I posted, but it meant so much to me to work with our community on the [sympathy card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkinPark/comments/6r7bcs/update_rlinkinpark_sympathy_card/) for Chester's family. The fact that a guard promised to deliver the card directly to them made even more special.

>>Also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkinPark/comments/7qi4at/probably_the_most_accurate_one_yet/).


>##Do you have a favorite song from them?

>>**u/LinkinPlayground** My favorite song has been A Line In The Sand for a really long time.


>>**u/Todogo** Oh man, maybe Waiting For The End?


>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/LinkinPlayground** Nothing else to add. Thank you very much for the feature!


>>**u/Todogo** I just really appreciate how this community came together in the months after last year's tragedy. Hitting /r/all attracted a ton of newcomers to the subreddit, many of them unpleasant, but a large majority have stuck around to become positive and supportive contributors to this community.

First of all Congrats to Ethan and Hila on the pregnancy hope all goes well!

/r/h3h3productions is dedicated to h3h3Productions (often shortened to h3h3 or simply h3) an Israeli-American comedy YouTube channel produced by husband and wife duo [Ethan and Hila Klein](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/h3h3productions-sued.jpg). Their content mostly consists of reaction videos and sketch comedy in which they satirize internet culture. In addition to their main channel, they run a secondary vlog channel by the name of Ethan and Hila and a third channel called H3 Podcast. 

The H3 Podcast channel features live-streams that were originally live on their Twitch.tv channel. The podcast covers a variety of topics, some controversial. There is also H3 Podcast Highlights YouTube channel which features short clips of the podcast. The podcast primarily features Ethan and Hila interviewing celebrities and YouTubers. The podcast also has a ""Top Of The Week"" segment, where Ethan and Hila comment on current events involving the internet and the world. 

I probably spent 6 hours watching video after video when I first found them. I haven't laughed that hard at a channel in so long it was so refreshing I had to see if they had a Subreddit and of course they did. I believe you guys should check this subreddit out because just like the people its dedicated to it's hilarious and you'll find the community is extremely cool!

**1,618** *In SEC Nation* for **7 Years!**
 
  
 r/SECFootball was created 6 years ago and promptly abandoned. It sat alone in reddit's dusty back room where abandoned subs sit idle until a customer walks in who isn't interested in the bright shiny baubles that seem to fly off the shelves. These types of customers like to dig deep in the bin to see if just maybe they can find that diamond in the rough that will make all the searching worthwhile.

SEC Football is a behemoth. It dominates the landscape of college football. In spite of all this attention, there was no home on reddit for a general SEC football focused subreddit. Sure, each team has their own sub and r/CFB is a colossus, but there wasn't a place where rivals in this conference could gather to inflate each other's egos while ridiculing their rivals. Until now.

I present to you the new and improved r/SECFootball. We've cleaned out the cobwebs and we want to come out of Reddit's back room and take our rightful place in the front window with all the other shiny baubles. If you're a fan of one of the 14 member teams, I hope you'll join us there so that we can discuss the sport and conference, meme, and yes, make fun of each other in good spirit. Post a meme about Florida fans and why they wear Jorts. Ridicule Tennessee for losing every conference game. Crown Alabama as the next national champion 10 minutes after they win the past year's national championship. Rejoice with Auburn fans when they run a missed field goal for 106 yards to win an Iron Bowl not many thought they would. Remind yourself that Missouri is actually a member school. Be amazed as Kentucky's Bennie Snell runs over, around, and through defenses.

Visit us at r/secfootball, flair up and join the discussion. Why SEC Football? Because it just means more. 


The timing couldn’t be better for this feature. We are proud to announce our first ever AMA on the subreddit with Alex Martin Smith, author of SEC Football's Greatest Games: The Legendary Players, Last-Minute Prayers, and Championship Moments.will be with us here live on Tuesday 10/23 from 5-7pm EDT, (4-6pm CDT) for an Ask Me Anything session with the users of r/secfootball.

**16,773 Pawns in 7 years**

We are the Dragon's Dogma Community on Reddit !! For those who don't know, **Dragons Dogma** is an RPG released by Capcom in 2012, with a re-release (which was basically a big souls-esque DLC), and still has an active community on ps4, Xbox One and PC despite its age. Due to its brilliant, a varied gameplay with sometimes derpy lines (Eg: half the stuff your companions say is so stupid) and **a sequel could be in the works if enough support is shown**.

 The Dragon’s Dogma community is still going strong ([ with over 500 daily players](https://steamspy.com/app/367500)) and an active discord [(Check it out here!)](https://discord.gg/D4psTHx). **New players are more than welcome** to come ask questions about certain enemies, loot, vocations or skills.

DD’s gameplay is where it shines; even though it has dated graphics and a VERY confusing story, along with intimidating bosses plaguing the land of *Gransys*, an incredibly satisfying combat system, with the [**COOLest spell system I know**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd03yAV3BLY). It is one of 2 games that I know of where you can [**actually climb monsters to fight them**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonsDogma/comments/4psyxz/is_this_the_right_subreddit_to_post_rock_climbing/). Here are a few random [Climb-and-Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGVoQf_jNdQ) videos [I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_mRr4Q_BgY).

Those looking for a more challenging game aren’t lost in the woods eating cranberries because **the Dark Arisen version** (which is the only one you can buy currently) has you covered with a separate area accessible from very early on hosting harder enemies, better loot and the literal incarnation of death who can appear out of nowhere, which keeps you on a knife's edge!

All of this is just the tip of the iceberg for Dragon’s Dogma, with [**character creation**](https://old.reddit.com/r/DragonsDogma/comments/5067oa/my_character_formulas_are_masterworks_all_you/), really complex lore (it IS a JRPG after all !) and **9 very distinct classes** for you to try out.

/r/Comicbooks is a subreddit dedicated to discussing comic books and everything involved with them from the comics themselves, films, TV shows, fan art, comic writers & artists..etc

The community on here is extremely strong which is one of the things that brings me back pretty much daily to this sub, as well as the consistent quality content. Whether you're a newcomer or a life long fan this is a great place for you. The moderators have made it a priority to help out as much as possible. 

They put together important lists that you can find on the side bar like the [rules and FAQ,](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/wiki/faq) getting started which [shows you where to buy comics and Comic software and apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/wiki/faq#wiki_where_to_buy_comics), Where to start reading whether it be [Superheroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/wiki/recommendations#wiki_superhero_recommendations), [Non-Superheroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/wiki/recommendations#wiki_without_superheroes), or [/r/comicbooks community favorites](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/7s1fjw/the_official_rcomicbooks_favorite_comic_book/). One of the most exciting things that happens on /r/ComicBooks is that they have AMA's with Comic writers, artists...etc They have a couple upcoming ones Christopher Hastings and Branson Reese on Tuesday, October 16th, starting at 11AM EST. You may know Christopher from his work at Marvel Comics on The Unbelievable Gwenpool, or his own Dr. McNinja. Branson is mostly known for his webcomic, Swan Boy. As well as  [Shawn Daley on October 22nd](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/9o7rj8/upcoming_amas_christopher_hastings_and_branson/) a cartoonist from Canada who got his start in this very community!

>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/temporal712** I started lurking on the sub about 4-5 years ago, but wasn't really active until they got a discord about 2 years ago, where I joined the first day, and got to know a lot of people from the early adopters, most of whom became our mod team today, including me!


>>**u/Llamaentity** I’m a relative newcomer to the subreddit. I started lurking around three years ago as I started getting more heavily back into comics. My activity picked up a lot when I joined the Discord server made in late October of 2016.

>>**u/vgulla** I joined the subreddit when I started reading comics for the first time probably in 2014/2015, and started paying attention in the summer of 2015.


>>**u/TheStealthBox** I joined around 2015 when I started using reddit properly. ~~I've regretted it since~~

>>**u/therealcinco** I was introduced to the sub through the discord server. I joined in the first couple of days and everybody was super welcoming. I loved the atmosphere and the diversity of opinions. It’s gotten me out of my comfort zone and I’ve read things I never would have considered otherwise. 


>>**u/JimJamsJimbo** Well, I joined about two years ago just cause I started a reddit account and was like ""well I like comics."" But I ended up staying around because it was a really great way to keep up to date with news, and find great new things to read, and just get a good grasp of what the public opinions are on certain things.


>##What got you into comic books?

>>**u/temporal712** I always liked watching Superhero Movies and Cartoons, (Would you believe it was the Nic Cage Ghost Rider Movies that started it all?) but I never really had a way to get into actual comics. Until I went to the library one day, and saw that someone on the staff had started pulling the current run of The Amazing Spider-Man. I remember thinking, ""Wow, I didn't know libraries could have comic books. I haven't ever read one. let's see what its all abut."" I stopped by every week to see if they had a new issue out, (Didn't understand comic schedules then), and when a new issue didn't come out, I devoured their comic section. Easily over 300 different trade paperbacks, read within a summer.


>>**u/Llamaentity** I got into comic books fairly randomly in 1992 or so. My mom decided to take my brother and me to the local comic shop and we each picked out a few things. For me, it was Mark Verheiden’s Aliens, which still holds up as a great comic to this day. My brother incidentally picked Verheiden’s Predator, which is also fantastic. From those, I got a great taste of just how beautiful and awesome comics can be.

>>**u/vgulla** I've been interested in comic book characters since I saw the first Raimi Spider-Man movie as a kid, and for a while I would look at wikipedia and Marvel/DC wikis to get a proper understanding of the history of characters in the comics. During the latter years of high school, I realized that I would rather read the comics themselves than just wikipedia summaries of them, and so here we are.


>>**u/TheStealthBox** Since I was a little baby box I grew up watching various superhero adapations such as the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy and the DCAU. Eventually that love for the characters got me into superhero comics and ~~I've regretted it since~~

>>**u/therealcinco** For the most part, I was introduced to comics through the CW Flash show. I’d watched Marvel movies before, and I was always interested in the characters, but before that point I had never really delved into any comic books. From there, I started reading Flash and Aquaman and they are still two of my favorite characters to this day. 


>>**u/JimJamsJimbo** I don't specifically know what got me into comics, but my earliest memory of comics was that my grandparents would get these Spider-Man digests, of just some super old stories, I'm pretty sure they were like, the early years or something. But I loved them! I would sit there and just read them for hours when I was only like 5 or 6, it was legit my favorite thing I ever got as a kid. I dabbled a little bit when I was growing up, mainly reading a bunch of wiki articles and picking up a series here and there whenever I went to the flea market. I decided to jump full-force into comics with DC Rebirth, because I figured it would be a good jumping on point, and my wallet has regretted it ever since.

>##What are some of your all time favorite comic books?

>>**u/temporal712** Ooff, that's a toughie. Jason Aaron's Run on Ghost Rider is probably my all time favorite. Add a lot of lore to my favorite character, and shapes the mythos is new and exciting ways. Another top contender is the Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti run of Jonah Hex. Almost every issue was self contained, and hosted a cavalcade of guest talent from all the big names. Another would be Robert Kirkman's Invincible, and Mark Waid's Irredeemable, for showing me that comics aren't just about the big 2. Oh, Throw Ed Brubaker's Sleeper in there as well!


>>**u/Llamaentity** My favorite comics are always difficult to boil down to a short list, but I’ll do my best to just name a couple here. All-Star Superman. Verheiden’s Aliens. Ellis’ Moon Knight. Fear Agent. Berserk.

>>**u/vgulla** My favorite comics of all time would include Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye by James Roberts, Captain America: Sam Wilson by Nick Spencer, Batgirl by Kelley Puckett, and Moon Knight by Jeff Lemire.


>>**u/TheStealthBox** My favourite comic book of all time is Animal Man by Grant Morrison. Some of the my other all time favourites are The Flash by Mark Waid, All Star Superman, One Piece, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run

>>**u/therealcinco** My favorite comics are always in flux, but I have a few that I’ll consistently recommend and love to death. Surprising absolutely nobody, I’m going to say Aquaman by Johns, Parker, and Abnett, the Cosmic Marvel Saga by Abnett and Lanning, Nova by Loveness and Perez, and virtually anything by Jeff Lemire and Donny Cates. A few of my other current favorites are Curse Words by Soule and Browne, Black Hammer (which, yes, I already mentioned Lemire, but it deserves its own spot), Exiles by Saladin Ahmed, and Champions by Jim Zub. 


>>**u/JimJamsJimbo** Scott Pilgrim is definitely my favorite book, but my very very very close answers include Ultimate Spider-Man, Invincible, and Morrison's Animal Man. I can't recommend any of these enough, dude

>##Do you have an all time favorite post on the sub?

>>**u/temporal712** I know that the picture of the Ghost Rider of 1,000,000 B.C. is near the top of our top posts of all time page. I think that speaks for itself. It's why comics were made. Also, [unbiased opinion, that Jonah Hex Breakdown is a pretty good post. Just sayin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/6uj6ip/i_recently_read_every_appearance_of_the_infamous/)


>>**u/Llamaentity** [temporal712’s incredible Jonah Hex bounty hunter profit breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/6uj6ip/i_recently_read_every_appearance_of_the_infamous/). This is the kind of content that comes around very rarely and I’ve always admired the amount of time and effort he put into it.

>>**u/vgulla** [I love soulreaverdan's guides to reading IDW's Transformers comics](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/7qbjby/so_you_want_to_read_transformers_by_idw_3_revenge/). They're some of the best comics ever and in my opinion, criminally overlooked, and he does such a great job making them accessible.


>>**u/TheStealthBox** 5 days before DC Universe Rebirth #1 hit stores, someone leaked spoilers onto the subreddit. All of us losing our shit about the spoilers and then the proof they showed us was a wild and memorable time

>>**u/therealcinco** My favorite post is a recent AMA we did with [Gerry Duggan](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/970o3e/hi_im_gerry_duggan_here_to_talk_comics_give_away/). It was one of the first AMAs we held after I became a mod and Duggan is a creator I absolutely love. He told me about his vision for the universe and how he views the genre of cosmic comics, which I’m a huge fan of. It was a really intimate answer from one of my favorite writers and I still go back and read it every once in a while. 


>>**u/JimJamsJimbo**  I like the announcement where they introduced Cinco, PhantomMagget, and myself as mods, just because of the powerful ""WHO?"" that erupted when people saw I got accepted. That, or when Chip Zdarsky replied to my questions in the AMA. (That I set up, by the way.)

>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/temporal712** The mod team has a couple goals for the future of the sub. For the past 8 months or so, we have had a series of successful AMA's with several creators in the business, so we hope to keep that streak going! Next, we are planning to add a discussion series to our weekly scheduled mod posts, detailing recommendations and current favorite books of the mod team, for newcomers to pick up, and hopefully recommend their own! For long term goals, we have been hard at work revamping and modernizing our wiki page, that has a lot of details about where to start reading certain characters, their history, and the top runs by the top creators for these characters, It's a long process, but one thats being worked on!Another thing we are currently brainstorming about is ideas to further foster discussion in our sub, as we note that unlike our sister sub /r/DCcomics, the discussions on our posts aren't as in depth as they can be. We have been trying to think of ways to encourage more debate and discussion, but so far we are at an impasse. Doesn't mean we won't stop trying!


>>**u/Llamaentity** For me personally, I’m going to keep making the new pixel art flairs for the subreddit. As a mod team, we have some art competitions in mind, more AMAs with popular creators in the works, and other stuff!

>>**u/vgulla** I'm doing a lot of work on our wiki recommendation lists. I'd really like for the subreddit to be a great resource for helping both newcomers and veterans find out what's worth reading.


>>**u/TheStealthBox** Well I think at some point I think I need to land an AMA with a creator since all of my fellow mods have been doing great with that. I should probably pull my weight too. Overall as a team we're constantly working out how to generate meaningful discussion on our sub and to create useful resources for our users such as the recommendations on the wiki.

>>**u/therealcinco** Honestly, I just want the sub to be a welcoming place for newcomers. I’ve always been a bit of an introvert and discovering the sub and the discord server worked wonders at bringing me out of my shell. If I can have that effect on just one person who discovers the community, I’ll feel like I did a good job. Of course, we don’t want to stop there, though. We’re always trying to figure out new ways to connect with the community and we have some cool new ideas in store!



>##Anything else you'd like to add?

>>**u/temporal712** I would like to add one more thing, yes. I have never lost a Thunderdome match in our Discord, thus making me the Thunder King. This basically means I have all the power. Take great care to remember this in your post about us. It is very important to me.


>>**u/Llamaentity** Be sure to join us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/r-comicbooks)! We love getting new members to join us!

>>**u/vgulla** I'd like to express my undying love for all of my fellow mods, especially those with the power to demote me. I'd also like to encourage people to join our discord server!


>>**u/TheStealthBox** Well at some point I need to brush up on my comic book trivia and take away temporal's title of Thunder King. ALSO RESPECT THE GODDAMN HYPHEN PEOPLE, ABUSING AUTOMODERATOR BECAUSE HE SEEMS OBNOXIOUS AND SPAMMY DOES NOT EXCUSE YOUR DISRESPECT FOR CORRECT SPELLING

>>**u/therealcinco** On November 3rd, the mod team is going to be streaming on Twitch in partnership with Extra Life. All donations in our name will go to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, which is very special to me personally. They’ve saved the lives of multiple members of my family several times and anything I could give back to them would be wonderful. We’ll be streaming all day, so drop by and hang out with us when you can! 


>>**u/JimJamsJimbo**  I really just want people to enjoy comics, man. I feel like anyone can enjoy any sort of medium of entertainment if they just give it a chance and find the right thing for them. Everyone's got something that can speak to them in a way that they need to hear, and maybe that way could be through comics. But they're like super stupid anyway so who knows

/r/comics is a subreddit is for everything related to print comics and web comics. Artists are encouraged to post their own work. News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome.
 
I became a moderator on here about 7 months ago, because if you couldn't tell from a lot of my features I really love art, comics..etc it's been a great experience seeing a constant wealth of talented people submitting their art and some of their favorite art. 

One of the cool things about this sub is a dedication to support artists and original content. Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. Message the moderators with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair. Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their ""Original Content."" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.

We care about the community and the quality of life on the sub so please Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand. - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic. Don't attack artists posting their content. - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. And please don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling. - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.


This subreddit often gets confused with /r/Comicbooks, which is understandable but this sub leans towards Web Comics more than comic books, so make sure to check out /r/Comicbooks if that's what you're more interested in, but that doesn't take anything away from /r/Comics. I believe you will be able to have a great time on here regardless!

/r/comicbookmovies is a subreddit dedicated to discussing cinematic and live-action television adaptations of comic books. There have been adaptions made for decades but we're truly living in the Golden Age of Comic Book movies and TV Shows.

With subs like /r/marvelstudios/ or /r/DC_Cinematic/ you can only discuss things involving those films from the specific companies where on /r/ComicBookMovies they're all game you can discuss films from both companies as well as films from other Comic Publishers. Which is extremely nice because while there are knuckle heads and fanboys on each side it shows most the time we can all co-exist regardless of what are preferences are, we're more alike than we are different. 

The community is extremely passionate and creative, you can find some really excellent fan made content on here as well as theories and discussions. I always enjoy my visits on here. I'm passionate about these films and with 12 + films coming out in the next year and chance with many more coming this subreddit will continue to grow and evolve. On top of all the films coming out there is no shortage of comic book related television shows.  

I truly hope this Golden Age of Comic Book movies lasts as long as possible, I remember growing up wishing we could get something like this so experiencing it the last decade has been a joy. Whether you're a long time fan or someone who only watches them because they're fun and have awesome action come visit this sub I'm sure you'll have a good time and find something to connect with!

>##What was the first film that got you hooked on Comic Book Movies?


>>**u/Owent10** I'm something of a Spider-Man (2002) fan myself, I love the origin story and Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was great. 

>>**u/PhoOhThree** I would say the first few MCU movies and the way they did it. Multiple Heroes coming together into a big cinematic universe expanding over movies and TV shows. That has never been done before on such a big scale.




>##With the many films coming out in the next few years, which ones are you most excited about?


>>**u/Owent10** Aquaman looks like a visual feast, Shazam looks great but I'm most hyped for Avengers: ~~Legacy~~ 4 

>>**u/PhoOhThree** It would be a crime to not say Avengers 4 considering this will be the end to the Saga of Thanos of the first 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.



>##What do you think is the most underrated CBM?


>>**u/Owent10** The first Fantastic Four movie is definitely underrated. It gets trashed everywhere but in my opinion it's a light hearted guilty pleasure. At least the costumes were spot on. I always liked Julian McMahon as Doom. Honorable mention to Spider-Man 3 

>>**u/PhoOhThree** The most underrated Comicbook Movie for me is Kick-Ass. The most underrated Comicbook TV Show is The Gifted, even though it doesn't hold up to the other TV shows such as Agents of Shield, DD, Titans it does a great job of showing the Age of Mutants post X-Men/Brotherhood on a smaller scale on a day to day basis.





>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/Owent10** [If the MCU was made in the 90s](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/9cfx9b/what_if_the_marvel_cinematic_universe_was_made_in/) - this cast is more spot-on than the one we have. 

>>**u/PhoOhThree** Honestly seeing the both sides of the Marvel and DC fans coming together and discussing the PROS and CONS of each of the franchises even though there can be a few fanboys.



>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?


>>**u/Owent10** Just to grow the sub and gain more subscribers. It's been a community for almost 10 years now
>>**u/PhoOhThree** Keep growing at a steady pace and hoping to see more people here in the future now that we are at a Golden Age of Comic Book movies and TV Shows.


>##Anything else you want to add?


>>**u/Owent10** Excelsior!

/r/ladyladyboners is a place for our favorite pictures of our favorite ladies, doing the things that make them our favorites. They welcome anyone who celebrates girls being wonderful.

There are a lot of image based subreddits dedicated to beautiful women but I believe this one stands it showcases them doing what we grew appreciate them doing its not just all photos from photo shoots or red carpet appearances yet there are a lot of those as well. An example would be a gif of [Gal Gadot on set smiling at the camera during a take](https://www.reddit.com/r/ladyladyboners/comments/71i960/gal_gadot_gets_a_lot_of_love_around_here_but_its/) or [Katheryn Winnick Directing an episode of Vikings](https://i.imgur.com/oygZsuK.jpg)

While the subreddit does allow NSFW photos they mandate that they be tagged as such so if you have your preferences set right you should be good to go. They also recommend the *'Harder'* stuff be posted on other subs so if you're Faint of heart when it comes to NSFW material this sub should be okay for you, but that is not a guarantee so do not hold it against me.

At the end of the day subreddits like /r/ladyladyboners are meant to celebrate these beautiful women that deliver great entertainment. Come check out the sub **here are a few subs that will give you a taste of what you can expect here!**

*  [Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen](https://www.reddit.com/r/ladyladyboners/comments/8cqqwh/aubrey_plaza_and_elizabeth_olsen/)

*  [Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Dormer on the red carpet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ladyladyboners/comments/56h40y/jennifer_lawrence_and_natalie_dormer_on_the_red/)

*  [Office girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/ladyladyboners/comments/99mq1t/office_girl/)

*  [Floor Jansen (current singer of Nightwish) in all of her 6'1"" glory](https://www.reddit.com/r/ladyladyboners/comments/9glmv5/floor_jansen_current_singer_of_nightwish_in_all/)


>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/crazycoffin** I joined the subreddit as there was a call for new moderators and I've been a consistently active user. I was curious about being a mod as I hadn't done it before and since this was a small sub, it seemed like a good way to satisfy that curiosity. I also like the subject matter.


>##Do you have a favorite person who gets submitted to the sub often?

>>**u/crazycoffin** I don't think I have a favorite person who is submitted frequently. I have a pretty broad range of women I find attractive and a bonus of the sub being oriented towards queer women is that a very broad range of women are submitted.

>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/crazycoffin** I don't currently have future plans for the subreddit. Although I'm a moderator, I wouldn't say it's ""my"" sub. I don't know if any of the other mods have some long term goals for it but, honestly, I really like that it's a smaller sub with a relatively niche focus. It means we're generally peaceful and very positive. I don't know if I'm the best mod to answer these questions, ha. I feel like I'm pretty much just happy to keep on doing what we're doing.

>For context an AMA is a question-and-answer interactive interviews termed ""AMA"" (short for ""Ask Me Anything""). AMA interviewees have ranged from various celebrities to everyday people in several lines of work.

 

AMAs are open to all Reddit users, but interviewees require proof that they are who/what they claim to be. They use the site's comment system for both questions and answers; this process has been equated to an online press conference. Like the rest of Reddit, users can also upvote and downvote potential candidates - with the most favoured being more likely to receive an answer. So just like in life it can go terribly wrong. /r/AMADisasters is a subreddit is for those epic Ask Me Anything posts where for whatever reason, Reddit turns on the original poster.

While this is a place to enjoy and have a good time with some of these unfortunate turn of events it is not a place to push your opinion or agenda. An AMA is not necessarily a disaster if you just don't personally agree with it. And the community is a welcoming place the mods make it a priority to keep it a good place to be. Making a emphasis to make sure users refrain targeting users or individuals, especially if it is not on topic with the AMA. 

**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

*  [Jared Leto does AMA with sock puppet accounts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMADisasters/comments/6lcvs3/jared_leto_does_ama_with_sock_puppet_accounts/)




>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/stanfan114** It has been a while but after seeing so many AMA posts from celebrities just pushing a movie or show and not answering any other questions, I created this subreddit to call them out. The famous Woody Harrelson ""Let's focus on the movie, people"" AMA comes to mind. Sometimes they are just misinformed about reddit, other times it seems like arrogance, but watching redditors turn on them creates interesting drama. 
 
>##Whats your favorite thing about the sub? 

>>**u/stanfan114**  Watching the rich and famous dig their own graves with their own words, for one. And again the drama is entertaining, in a train-wreck kind of way. 
 
>##Do you have a favorite post? 

>>**u/stanfan114**  [Jose Conseco, everybody ](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMADisasters/comments/384m5j/jose_conseco_everybody/)
 
>##What are your plans for the sub in the future? 

>>**u/stanfan114**  As a mod I try to be hands off as much as possible, my co-mod Grammaton485 has done a great job enforcing the rules and keep the sub on track. We've added rules on how to deal with astroturfing and shill reports and personal attacks which were getting out of hand, but that's it.
 
>##Anything else you want to add? 

>>**u/stanfan114**  Back when Victoria was hosting AMAs for celebrities there were fewer real disasters as she was a great curator for the sub. After she left I think there were more truly disastrous AMA's which is good for us but losing Victoria was a loss for Reddit in general.

>>My hope is the subreddit is seen not as a place to hate, but to enjoy a little internet drama and schadenfreude. All links are no-participation and we are anti-brigade. Woody Harrilson is the mascot as his AMA is probably the most famous disaster, but it's all in good fun. I'm really a huge fan of Woody and wish for his continues success. 


Also, **What's the deal with Woody Harrelson?**

*[Woody Harrelson's](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/) AMA to promote his film Rampart is regarded as one of the worst AMAs of all time, and was the inspiration for this sub.*

 r/Justfuckmyshitup is a subreddit where we collect images of rather unconventional hairstyles. This brings up an important question. Where is the line between ""unconventional"" and just plain fucked up? Well you're in luck! Never has it been easier to determine the answer to this question. 

We have all had that haircut we got that just didn't go as planned or have seen someone with a haircut that just makes you double take and go what the hell happened. When I found this sub I had to bookmark it and subscribe because I couldn't help but laugh. The community is pretty awesome as well they're straight up and real no white knighting allowed. Also, there is No photoshopped images. No drawings, cartoons or painting allowed so all the fucked up haircuts you'll find on here are 100% the real deal.

No political posts or comments, they only care about the fucked up hair. they want this sub to be free from political content. The main point of the sub is simply to entertain. So stop on by, maybe submit a fucked up cut or two, vote on some cuts you see, and participate in the comments in such a way that everyone can leave unoffended and at least a little entertained.  

 


**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/Kesha_Paul** I joined this subreddit because it's absolutely hilarious. I stumbled across it one day and laughed myself to tears at the clever descriptions of terrible hair. I was thrilled when offered a mod spot because I had been subscribed so long. 

>>**u/siouxsie_siouxv2**  I started here when my friend syzmcs and I were reminiscing about that time he removed my post a year or two ago and we had an argument that we both remember, it started out kind of harsh but ended with us making jokes and became kind of a roast. RIP /u/syzmcs Anyway, he sent me an invite during the conversation, which is great because this is one of my favorite subreddits. 

>>**u/sighs__unzips** The original mod invited me. I joined because I liked the posts.  



>>**u/SpartacusThomas** The original mod invited me. The largest subreddit I had modded before this was ~10k, so this was pretty cool. I'm glad I'm part of the team.

>##Whats your favorite thing about the sub?

>>**u/Kesha_Paul** My favorite thing about the subreddit is that the community isn't a toxic shithole that often turns into political bitching like most subs. It happens on occasion, but for the most part the community is awesome and mostly positive. 

>>**u/siouxsie_siouxv2**  I love that users are forced to be creative with their titles. You can't just say ""look at this bad haircut"" , if you want your post to do well you have to have a funny description to go with the picture.

>>**u/sighs__unzips** Funny haircuts! 



>>**u/SpartacusThomas** I like the haircuts, of course, but I also just really enjoy sitting back and going through unmodded posts. It's sorta relaxing. 

>##Do you have a favorite post?

>>**u/Kesha_Paul** Honestly, it's insanely hard to pick a favorite post, but the [classic album](https://imgur.com/a/4BlMN) has some of the best. This [one is great as well](https://redd.it/7lvy0k)

>>**u/SpartacusThomas** That helicopter hair post had me laughing hard. It's so bad it's amazing. https://i.imgur.com/m5w9Ivk.jpg


>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/Kesha_Paul** For the future, we would just like to keep this place drama free, free of political bickering, and continue to show the best worst haircuts ever. 

>>**u/sighs__unzips** None really atm.  

 

>>**u/SpartacusThomas** I would love to see it continue to grow. I think the mod team is at a really good place right now, but I think the subreddit could always get better.  


>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/Kesha_Paul** There's nothing else I want to add, but another mod may want to add something. Your timing just happened to correlate with the main mod deleting his account, so again apologies for taking so long to get back to you 

>>**u/sighs__unzips** Thanks for featuring us!  



>>**u/SpartacusThomas**  Thanks so much! Jfmsu is one of my favorite subs on reddit

This sub-reddit is a forum for TheVenomSite.com, and a community for discussing symbiotes, Carnage, Toxin, Anti-Venom and everything Venom-related, including comics, film, and television!

From his first full appearance in Amazing Spider-Man 300 to his own feature film, anything regarding Venom is welcome! The Venom feature film came out October 5th so this is the best time to come visit because you'll get to check out all the reactions good, bad, or indifferent towards the film. 

A little information about the character the sub is based on: The Venom symbiote bonded with Spider-Man during his adventure in the first ""Secret Wars"" on the Beyonder's makeshift planet called Battleworld. Initially, he thought the symbiote was just a costume. However upon his discovery that it was sentient, he rejected it. Since then, the symbiote has bonded with several different hosts. 

The Venomaniac community is what makes this place so much fun. Venomaniac's is a term of endearment that's what they call themselves. They are a passionate and enthusiastic bunch that will make your visit a guaranteed good time.

It's the little details that often differentiate a good game from a masterpiece. While the large parts making up the game are certainty important, it's those small details and Easter eggs that make the immersion so much more real, and that make the player feel really happy whenever they find them. Things like [seemingly unimportant events being referenced in later games in the franchise] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7livi2/at_the_beginning_of_the_first_half_life_you_can/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GamingDetails), [little realistic effects in weapons that you wouldn't expect to see] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7k7j5c/if_you_partially_pull_the_trigger_on_a_controller/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GamingDetails), and even [hidden messages within the OSTs frequency spectrum] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/6khryc/in_doom_2016_a_spectrograph_of_the_soundtrack/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GamingDetails). There are so many small details and hidden Easter eggs in video games, that serve as little rewards for the dedicated players who take the time to look around past the main game.

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Following on from the success of /r/moviedetails kind of exploding within a few days we thought it'd be a cool idea to branch out and make some similar subreddits for other media, seeing as we were getting a lot of TV / gaming related posts on moviedetails as it was. Aside from a couple of mods who just moderate one of the three subreddits (TVDetails, GamingDetails, and MovieDetails) we all mod all three so we try to keep them pretty tightly knit.


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Honestly not too bad. Keep out reposts, spoilers, and spam (amateur app devs seem to love trying to promote their asset flip games on every subreddit with ""gaming"" in the name) and ensure all posts fit within general rules. Comment civility is another area that takes a priority but generally they're all good.

> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** I saw https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/81rf3r/in_far_cry_3_you_can_find_the_buried_head_in_the/ on my frontpage a couple of days back and it occurred to me that despite seeing the game so often I'd never even noticed the skull...

> **4: What are some of your favourite small details in video games?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Generally I love stuff where game designers put in subtle references to their past - https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7zlunl/in_super_mario_odysseys_balloon_world_update/ as an example.

> **5: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Short term hopefully watch it grow more and see more great submissions come in! Long term no idea, ideas are welcome!

> **6: Anything else you want to add?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Not really, no.


You have to marvel at the tiny things that designers will slip in their work, and likewise, the players who discover them. I often fail to notice ""hidden"" switches needed to progress in dungeons, and spend 20 minutes looking for it before realising that it was in plain fucking sight the whole time. But here you have people managing to locate [tiny reflections in 2002 games] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7iwzat/in_spiderman_2002_in_the_mission_breaking_and/), and [toilet seats changing orientation depending on what gender your character is] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7onllv/in_prey_2017_depending_on_what_gender_you_choose/). I'm sure most of you are gamers to some extent. I'd recommend you all to check out this sub if you are, because you might just find hidden details about your favourite games. I, personally, have found many details about my favourite games that I never even noticed playing through them my first, second, eighth time. Maybe I'm just blind, though.

No Man's Sky is a game with a rough history. A disastrous launch turned the world away, and left only those few hardcore lovers of what No Man's Sky was, and could be. Today in 2018, it's those hardcore fans that have encouraged the world to reconnect with this community. A lot has changed for No Man's Sky this year, thanks to its biggest update yet in every possible sense of the word, **[No Man's Sky: NEXT](https://www.nomanssky.com/next-update/)**.

Since last year, /r/NoMansSkyTheGame has almost doubled in size as more and more players are willing to revisit this gem once again. NEXT added Multiplayer, Fleets of Ships, Graphical Overhauls, Weekly Events and so much more that it's impossible to fit in this one post. Developer Hello Games have begun releasing Weekly Dev Blogs in a heartfelt effort to truly connect with us players at last, and we're loving it! 

/r/NoMansSkyTheGame is possibly one of Reddit's friendliest, and most welcoming gaming communities to date! A community and game that went through trial by fire, burnt, then came out the other side as pure gold.

/r/LadyBoners  is an image based subreddit dedicated to showcasing ladyboners of all genders. Male, female, trans...anyone who gives a lady (or any other Redditors) a ladyboner!. You will find that the sub is filled to the brim with stars of movies, television, models, comedians, and sometimes athletes as well. We have featured quite a few subreddits dedicated to women so its about time. The feminine aspect of Reddit sometimes seems underrepresented on Reddit. 

This is not a subreddit to post photos of yourself a rule to take heed of is avoiding post of ones self (aka camera whoring). There are plenty of subreddits already in place for that. This is more of a forum for sharing well known individuals. The mods try to make the sub as welcoming as possible one of the biggest rules is “Please do not down vote submissions”. We’re an eclectic bunch of folks in here and some peoples’ fancy may be tickled by somebody that others find less than delightful. If this is the case, please do not downvote it and do not leave sour comments! Simply move on, or post somebody who lights you up like a firework.

Of course, you're not here just for me to explain how the sub works. You're here to see photos of Lady boners. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words. 
 
**So here's a glimpse of what you'll find there on /r/LadyBoners:**

*  [Young Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr](https://i.imgur.com/rC6eeu2.jpg)
*  [Jeffrey Dean Morgan](https://i.redd.it/s3gwgt0k03by.jpg)

>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/Byeuji**  The sub was originally founded by /u/obsessive_cook, just as kind of a joke. If I recall correctly, it was a conversation thread on twoxc (or a similar sub) that it would be fun to have a place to share hot dudes. She decided to do it and then realized quickly that she needed some help. The other mods and myself all offered assistance at around the same time, and before we knew it, the subreddit was blowing up.  
>>I had previous experience with modding /r/GirlGamers, and I viewed /r/LadyBoners as an opportunity to kind of relax a little bit while modding. Moderation can be a pretty taxing task, so getting to cut that stress with a healthy smattering of pretty men really takes the edge off.

>##Do you have a favorite person who gets submitted to the sub often?

>>**u/Byeuji**  My favorite LadyBoners are not terribly common. I happen to think Daniel Brühl is the hottest thing since sliced bread. I also really love Jon Stewart, who was very popular back in the day but has tapered off since leaving the Daily Show.

>>Of the common submissions, probably Matt Bomer and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau are my picks.


>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/Byeuji** Honestly, I think the sub is exactly where and what it should be. We have steady growth slightly behind the growth of reddit overall, which seems about right to me. If reddit had more robust moderation tools, we might try something more, but we've managed to create a very stable ecosystem with our existing tools that allows the subreddit to more or less run itself. I am loath to disrupt that.

>>I suppose one thing we could do is a CSS theme overhaul, since that's super old now. But honestly I feel like that would be wasted work with the continued changes reddit is making to how subreddit appearances are managed, and also the fact that the vast majority of our users access the subreddit via mobile device/phone app or new reddit (solidly over 80%). So maybe we'll wait and see what reddit settles on and modify within that.

>##What is the community like?

>>**u/Byeuji**  The community is surprisingly diverse. If I had to guess, I'd say we're probably 65-70% woman-identified users, and 30%~ male identified users. Many of the male users identify as bi/gay/pan, and their influence is apparent. We've often tossed around the idea of putting out a demographics survey, but we want to make sure we do it right so we don't make users feel alienated or studied.

>>At the end of the day though, our subreddit is super positive. Our number one rule is to support positivity in the subreddit, both through content submission, and in the comments. A lot of our users take that very seriously, and the net result is thread after thread of users loving on each other's crushes.

>>My favorite part, as a moderator, is how active our users are in using the official reporting process. We have a lot of methods to make moderation easier, and the #1 is user reports. I don't know that our users know how impactful their user reports are, because there's almost no way for us to communicate that back to them (since reports are anonymous), but we have several extremely active reporters who are very good at helping us keep track of what's going on throughout the subreddit. We are indebted to those members of the community, as is the rest of the community. It's gotten to the point where the most common offending posts (dick pics) are often removed within 10-15 minutes of being posted. 

>##Anything else you want to add? 

>>**u/Byeuji**  Only thing I would add... is if I could go back in time, I would ask the mods at /r/ladybonersgw to name their sub /r/gwladyboners instead, because 90% of the moderation actions we take are removing content from dudes who forgot to add ""gw"" to the end of the subreddit when they submit (it's hard to type one-handed). At this point, there isn't really a good solution, so I guess it's just a beast we'll have to deal with.

/r/LadiesOfTheMCU is an image based subreddit dedicated to the women who appear in TV shows and movies based off of Marvel properties that are a part of the MCU. With over 20 plus films and multiple television shows with no end in sight this is a sub that celebrates the women of the universe.

Another extremely exciting development within the Marvel Cinematic Universe is Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, the first female superhero lead for Disney's blockbuster comic book movie business, and 'the most powerful character' Marvel has come up with yet, according to the company's president. There is evidence that more female superhero movies are on the way.

Regardless of if you're a big fan of the MCU or not I still highly suggest checking this sub out there are a tremendous amount of beautiful women who have graced the screen big and small in this universe you won't regret your click. 


Women posted to /r/ladiesofthemcu must be over 18 at the time that the photo was taken. NSFW content is not permitted. Just that the lady must be in a movie or show that's part of the MCU. Sorry X-Men and Fantastic 4 fans (Sorry, hopefully they get brought into the MCU), those are not MCU films. But you can post freely at /r/GeekBoners, /r/Celebs, /r/Gentlemanboners among the many other subs around.

**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there on /r/ladiesofthemcu:**

>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/ZadocPaet** I already had /r/geekboners, and someone already made /r/DCEUboners. The MCU is so deep between the films and television shows. I'm a big fan, and a fan of many of the great actors in the show. The sub is just made to appreciate the incredibly talented women of the MCU. 

>##Who is your favorite or at least top three MCU starlets that get posted on here?

>>**u/ZadocPaet**  Perhaps ""starlets"" is not the right word. ""Starlets"" denotes young female actors, often minors. At /r/ladiesofthemcu all images must only feature people who are 18 and older. Even posts about actors with their kids will get removed.

>>On topic, my favorite two are probably Natalie Dormer and Jenna Coleman. Both are in Captain America: The First Avenger, and both have small roles. They've since become famous for other shows (Game of Thrones and Doctor Who, respectively). Most people don't know they were in an MCU film, so the comments are pretty entertaining.

/r/GeekBoners is an image based subreddit is dedicated to the geeky women of science, scifi, video games, anime, fantasy, and any and every geeky genre that's out there.  



Despite the fact that the subreddit name has been taken for six years, it didn't launch until 2 and a half years ago, and when it did it was the fastest growing non-default sub on reddit that day, thanks to a great mod team. This subs been described as a version of /r/GentlemanBoners that was just for women of science fiction. Ladies can be in formal attire, their costumes, or casual wear. But the titles have to state their ""geeky"" credentials. 

The subreddit just isn't for science fiction actors, but writers, actual scientists, directors, and pretty much anyone who has legitimate geeky creds. With how popular and accepted Geek culture has become this day and age this sub has never been as relevant as it is now. With Comic book movies, tv, anime, everything within your reach this is the golden age of Geek Culture and makes this an exciting time to frequent /r/GeekBoners! 

Some overall guidelines to be aware of before posting. The ladies posted on here  must be professionals; actresses, models, scientists, writers, et cetera. They must be in the public sphere. Their photos must also be intended for the public sphere. No leaks. No creepshots. No invasion of anyone's personal lives. In order to comply with this rule the cosplayer must first be a professional model, actress, or public figure. A good rule of thumb is if they have a Wikipedia entry. 

And make sure to Include the name of the fandom or lady's profession in the title [in brackets]. Movies and shows should be full titles. If posting a cosplayer In order to comply with this rule just ""[Cosplay]"" in the title isn't enough. The fandom or character they're cosplaying as still must be stated. Example: ""[Cosplay] Kristen Bell as Slave Leia.

**For examples of what to expect, here is a collection of some of the top posts of all time:** 

*  [[Doctor Who] Jenna Coleman](https://i.redd.it/az0fc7zwr6011.jpg)

*  [[The Avengers] Cobie Smulders](https://i.redd.it/r46nc2duevp01.jpg)

*  [[The Social Network] Brenda Song](https://i.redd.it/wpzfz5kfi8x01.jpg)

*  [[The Dark Knight Rises] Anne Hathaway](https://i.imgur.com/O6OVvWU.jpg)

*  [[Firefly] Morena Baccarin](https://i.redd.it/w31uwya8jnwy.jpg)

-----------
*I had the pleasure of asking one of the mods on /r/GeekBoners some questions check it out!*

>##Why did you start the subreddit?

>>**u/ZadocPaet**  We want to celebrate the talented and amazing women of science, technology, and scifi and fantasy movies and television shows. The sub is a mid-point between /r/gentlemenboners and /r/Celebs.

>>On /r/gentlemenboners, all images must feature women in formal attire, very formal attire. But rarely are they dressed like that on screen, and they often do promo shots and photoshoots that are totally the opposite of formal. Part of the idea was to create a sub like that, but with less strict posting rules.

>>Of course, /r/celebs exists, but half of the posts are NSFW. /r/GeekBoners only allows SFW posts. Basically, if network television can get away with it, we allow it.

>>Another thing that sets /r/geekboners apart is that we don't allow creepshots. You know, like from scumbag paparazzis who shoot womens asses when they are getting gas, buying groceries, walking their kid down the street. It's gross. It's disrespectful. It's also almost pointless. All photos on our sub must have been made for public consumption, e.g. professional photoshoots, public social media posts, stills and screenshots, et cetera.

>>At /r/geekboners we try to balance our feminist sensibilities with the reality that beauty and sexuality is currency. This is true for both genders, but it is disproportionately true for women. Further, since our sub is about women in the entertainment industry, that fact is exploded to greater levels. In addition to not allowing creepshots, we also don't allow comments disparaging the women in any way. Obviously, the prettier ones will get more upvotes. That's a given. Another given is that people will downvote images they don't like. But what we can step in to prevent is people calling the girls dogs, fat, ugly, and shit like that. Such comments are removed. 

>##What posts are the best?

>>**u/ZadocPaet**  The best ones generate interesting discussion about the topic. All posts on /r/geekboners must be tagged with what gives the lady geeky credentials. Sometimes the tags might be things like, [Computer Engineer], [Cosmonaut], or [Biologist], but most often the geek cred comes from being in a scifi show or movie. From time to time the discussion threads become interesting conversations about the film or show.

>>Other posts that I particularly like are ones where the reactions are things like, ""She was in that?"" or ""Who did she play in that?"" One of the more fun aspects of the sub are seeing posts that point out famous actresses in things you never knew they were in.

/r/DCEUboners is an image based subreddit dedicated to showcasing the actresses from the DC Extended Universe. Despite the ""boner"" in the title the purpose of the sub is to admire the amazing female actors of who have appeared in these films through 5 films with many more on their way.

With Aquaman, Shazam, Birds of prey, Flash, Batman, Birds of prey and so many more coming in the next few years the stable of actresses who can be posted on here will more than double. The stars are out of this world but don't underestimate the extras and background actresses like  [Doutzen Kroes](https://i.redd.it/oy9il66a4tb11.jpg), [Sophie Hind](https://i.redd.it/33i4ss46pl811.jpg), [Tenika Mahoney](https://i.redd.it/lke5e1xteu611.jpg), among many more. 

All posts to /r/DCEUboners must be of women who are at least 18 years of age at the time that the photo was taken. There are absolutely no No fake, photoshopped or leaked pictures allowed. If something NSFW is posted it has to be tagged.

If you're looking for DCEU discussion the best place would be /r/DC_Cinematic but whether you're a fan of what they are doing with the DC films universe don't let that distract you from the fact that they have some of the most beautiful actresses cast in these films.As it stands, only women who appear in official DCEU movies are allowed. Sorry Gotham and Nolan fans, but you have /r/geekboners. Sorry WB fans, but you have /r/FlarrowPorn.

**57,802** Gallifreyans *discussing* for **6 years!**  
  
Doctor Who premiered on November 23rd 1963. Initially conceived as an educational programme teaching children about history and science, it was a show about an old man simply called 'the Doctor', his granddaughter, and two of her schoolteachers travelling throughout time and space in a blue box called the TARDIS.  
  
Soon the Doctor's original assistants left and new assistants arrived. After the actor playing the Doctor, William Hartnell, was no longer well enough to play the part, a concept was written into the plot of the show (first called ""renewal"" and later solidified as ""regeneration"") where a dying Time Lord (the Doctor's people) can instead live by regenerating into a new body. Since the Doctor regenerated for the first time in 1966, the show has become very much different than it was when it had premiered in 1963, besides the base concept of being about a person called 'the Doctor'.  
  
With a TV Movie, 840 episodes of the TV show, and almost 55 years of the *Whoniverse* (comics, animation, choose-your-own-adventure books, novels, novelisations, audio dramas, [unlimited rice pudding, et cetera, et cetera](https://youtu.be/IJ-zt-o2mIM?t=169)), Doctor Who is a show full of subject matter for exploration. /r/Gallifrey is a subreddit dedicated to discussions and news for Doctor Who, focused on in-depth discussion which occasionally only makes sense to the most dedicated fans with the most specialized knowledge. However, besides the occasional esoteric thread about the canonicity of the novels or whatever, you don't need to be a level 200 IQ fan for the threads to make sense. Any fan of the show really get into the discussion and exploration of it. There's also a fortnightly [Free Talk Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/9jlzfi/rgallifreys_free_talk_fridays_practically_only/) for random conversation about whatever comes to mind and a weekly [Moronic Monday for 'No Stupid Questions'](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/9kfc2l/rgallifreys_no_stupid_questions_moronic_mondays/).    
  
Now, after another thirteen regenerations since 1966, the new Thirteenth Doctor is premiering today. Even if you haven't watched a second of the last 55 years of Doctor Who, that's fine - this new series is the perfect jumping-on point for possible new fans. It premieres today (October 7th) at 1:45PM ET / 10:45AM PT on BBC America and 6:45 BST on BBC One!

/r/Celebs is a subreddit is for photos and gifs of beautiful female celebrities. While there are plenty of safe for work pictures on this sub I do have to warn you there are a lot of NSFW photos posted every day. They are all marked and tagged so you wont have to worry about it popping up unless you don't have your reddit NSFW  preferences good to go. 

From my experiences frequenting the subreddit and posting the community has been extremely engaging and overall really friendly. While a lot of the comments are predictably about the woman in the post I really enjoy when the discussion turns to what movie, television show, or even band she might sing or play in. I've definitely broadened my tastes while frequenting this subreddit. 

A good example would be Alison Brie she is one of the actresses who gets posted more frequently on /r/Celebs as well as /r/Gentlemanboners who can blame them though she's gorgeous and really talented. I digress but after seeing her pop up a handful of times I checked out her imdb and discovered a show she was in from 2009-2015 called ""*Community*"" its become a favorite of mine. 

The moderators for /r/celebs are awesome people who work hard to keep the quality of life on the sub high as well as make sure the content is as only the best. I happen to mod some subs with a few of them and have nothing but good things to say about them if anything it makes me want to frequent the subs even more. 

They make sure there are No fakes or altered photos. Minor brightening/color correction, No porn/porn stars or leaked photos/videos. This applies to comments and posts. Bannable offense. Depictions of non-consensual sexual activity will be removed. No explicit genitalia. That means no sticky bits.  

This is a subreddit for admiring the beauty of the world, some subreddits focus on Art, Music, Movies, this one just happens to focus on the beautiful women. 

**Here is a taste of what you might find on here SFW:**

*  [Gal Gadot](http://i.imgur.com/ygUfd30.jpg)
*  [Taylor Swift](https://imgur.com/7l3MFtG)

>##What is your favorite thing about being a mod on Celebs?

>>**u/Minifig81**  The camaraderie of the mod team. We're all super close and talk often. Also seeing what new images get posted when they're not repeats. 
 
 
 

>##Who are some of your favorite celebs that get posted?

>>**u/Minifig81** I'm a huge sucker for Rosanna Pansino (my dream woman), Milana Vayntrub (another dream lady), Victoria Justice, Gal Gadot, Ana De Armas and Anna Kendrick.

This subreddit is a community where those interested in the sport as defined here can share their opinions and experience as well as the science of the sport. Don't devalue opinions and experience by dismissing them as ""broscience"". This subreddit is not a site for vetting only scientifically provable propositions. Remember, science, particularly in the area of sports and nutrition, is evolving rapidly. Our experience, though anecdotal, can help fill those gaps until the scientific community reaches consensus. This is an internet forum in which anyone can post and comment. Believe what people say at your own risk. 

News, articles, pictures, videos & advice on everything related to bodybuilding - nutrition, supplementation, training, contest preparation, and more are welcome here. Bodybuilding is specifically defined for purposes of this subreddit as the sport that involves preparing yourself for a competition (includes bikini, fitness, figure and physique). There are other subreddits better suited to those just interested in staying fit or building a beach body or lifting weights.

While I started weightlifting after watching the film '300' directed by Zack Snyder, but Bodybuilding has always been present in my life I've always been a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and wanted to look larger than life. When I started frequenting Reddit I went on a tear looking for all the subs related to my varied interests and once I found this sub I knew this was the place for me. While I might be more of a lurker than with most of the subs I'm in the community is extremely open and welcoming. 


**Here is a taste of what you can find on /r/Bodybuilding:**

*  [Thank you all for pumping me up on my birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/93fatt/thank_you_all_for_pumping_me_up_on_my_birthday/)

>##How did you find the sub?

>>**u/EatLiftLifeRepeat** I found this sub years ago when I first started gaining interest in working out at the gym. I think it was one of the ""related subs"" in the /r/fitness Wiki. At the time, I didn't even know what bodybuilding was or how it differed from other strength-training sports.

 
>##What got you into bodybuilding?

>>**u/EatLiftLifeRepeat** I started weight training to change my body composition, but once I started seeing some of my muscles getting bigger, I became fascinated with the process and wanted to push myself further to see what other muscles I can grow in my body.

 
>##Favorite Bodybuilder?

>>**u/EatLiftLifeRepeat** Arnold Schwarzenegger - I admire him for his drive, not just in bodybuilding, but in other aspects of his life as well.

 
>##Whats your favorite thing about the community?

>>**u/EatLiftLifeRepeat** Even though the subscriber count is growing at a rapid rate, the community maintains its community feel. A lot of regulars on the sub interact with each other through Instagram, Snapchat, and our Daily Discussion threads, and some even end up meeting each other in real life and becoming friends. I think that's really special and not too many large subs can say the same.

 
>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/EatLiftLifeRepeat** I haven't asked the other mods what their plans are, but I personally want to grow the interest and popularity of bodybuilding, and I think this sub is a great channel to do so.

 


>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/EatLiftLifeRepeat** Nope. Thanks for the feature!

/r/ImaginaryDC is a subreddit dedicated to artwork from the DC Comics Universe and it's a member of the Imaginary Network. 
The Imaginary Network Expanded (INE) is a network of art sharing subreddits ranging from broad in subject to very specific. It is the goal of the INE to share, inspire, discuss and appreciate paintings, drawings, and digital art while maintaining artist credit and source links.

I will always have a soft spot for this subreddit for many reasons, I love DC comics, I love art, and it was the first subreddit I got the honor to be a moderator on. Our promise is to show respect to content creators, submitters, and subscribers. It is our sincerest hope that you will find our moderation team approachable and helpful and the INE subreddits an interesting and fun place to be.

Being full of prospective artists and onlookers alike, the community is extremely supportive. Uploading your creations, or those of an admired artist, is always enthusiastically met. Here you will find a group of people eager to share in fine works, to expand their horizons, and to perpetuate a crucial art form: the careful application of beauty which in this case is dedicated to DC characters.

**Here are some examples of the art you might find on your visit to /r/ImaginaryDC**

Some would say that the true appeal of reddit lies in its smaller, less-noticed communities. If you're a mod or know of an obscure subreddit that deserves to be more widely known, this is the sub to post it. /r/Obscuresubreddits is a subreddit dedicated to the promotion of the obscure, the remote, the overlooked subreddits. 

I don't know about you but I'm always trying to find new subs to check out especially after I've refreshed my favorite ones a few too many times that day. I found /r/Obscuresubreddits on accident[ I hit the random button](https://i.imgur.com/2KmGIHK.png) at the top of my browser and was automatically intrigued by the concept behind the sub. Like /r/Subredditoftheday and /r/NewReddits I feel like /r/Obscuresubreddits is a really invaluable resource for these communities big and small.

Over the few months I've been subscribed I've found some really cool subs from it like [/r/ArtworkOfTheDay](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtworkOfTheDay/), [/r/OldSchoolUnCool](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolUnCool/), [/r/ClassicHorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicHorror/), and [/r/badscificovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscificovers/) to list a few. 
I would highly recommend checking this sub out and even posting your sub on their if it fits the guidelines which are 
    be at least 3 months old
    have at least 3 posts, and
    have either low traffic, low subscriber level, or both. 

 



>##What made you want to mod this sub?

>>**u/Zberblank**  u/greatyellowshark and I had collaborated frequently on past subreddits. OSR was one of many different projects we had at the time, but I remember thinking this one in particular had a lot going for it. Not only was it a great idea, but if properly nourished, it could be a great way of finding diamonds in the rough that is Reddit. 
 
>>**u/greatyellowshark**  I've always thought that reddit was most interesting on its less-traveled fringes, so to help others discover the strange and random subreddits that only a few people knew about seemed like a worthy endeavor. The creator and sole mod of /r/obscuresubreddits abandoned it so I put in a redditrequest. I think it had 100 readers or something then. Building up content and getting sidebar links took up much of our time back then. 

>##Do you have a favorite sub that has been posted? 

>>**u/Zberblank**  Do you have a favorite sub that has been posted? It's always fun seeing a subreddit that was posted to OSR grow. Some have had really incredible success, such as r/100yearsago . For recent submissions, I'd like to see r/askmusic get more activity. There are some interesting questions posted but not much in the way of answers. The potential is there. 

>>**u/greatyellowshark**  Hard to narrow it down to one, but some favorites are /r/DirgeMusic, /r/BuildaGurdy, and /r/BookInscriptions. /r/animalsofportland is the kind of niche subreddit that makes me want to keep looking, see what's out there. People come up with the greatest ideas and use reddit as a creative outlet. It's part of what makes reddit so special.

With that desire of freedom and lols, the grandest of all subreddits - /r/ComedyIndia created. Please note, it has nothing to do with pre-independent British India, except a lot of jokes. The subreddit is growing slowing with a one-stop location to discuss such content. 

Have they reconciled with their numerous multi-lingual comedies? Perhaps in the near future when humans land on mars. Regardless, the country's open internet will make sure no one in the world is spared with the Live Action version of BollywoodRealism X IndianPeopleFacebook. 

So, regardless of where or who you are in the world, they will find you, make you watch them and make you say to yourself, ""Is this Chicken Masala?"" 

For all the Indians, expats, ethnic Indians, people of Indian origin, people who married/date/befriended/rode an uber of an Indian or even those who had spicy Indian Tikka last night and would be birthing flames from hell in the morning - this is a great place to douse those embers of curiosity with a lighthearted comedy from this Asian Subcontinent. 



--------

We interviewed the tactical mastermind who thought of this masterful plot to. Please give a round of applause to /u/chin-ki-chaddi (which literally means **Chinese Underpants**, in Hindi)

**Q 1: Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>**Mr. Chinese Underpants:** One day I was posting something on RDD *(Random Daily Discussions)* about Indian comedy not being documented enough. Goldcunt *(A mystery to everyone)*  said *'why don't you start a subreddit?'* After submitting the proper documentation to the cyber cell division of Faridabad Police and the district magistrate, we smashed the coconut about half an hour later *(Corruption, Power, Coconuts)*. And the rest is, as they say, fell into insignificance.

**Q 2:What's moderating the sub like?**

>**Chaddi-Bro**: Lets say that I like getting spammers once in a while, just so I can learn new ways to ban/mute people. But its been alright, I feel like a bored housewife re-decorating the home every six months, just to keep myself occupied. *(Housewife needs to get laid more often)*

**Q 3: What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?**

>**Sugar-*'chini'*-Daddy:** TSP *(The Screen Patti)* has been churning out surprisingly great content. I think they connect with the masses better by using more Hindi than the cringe-inducing Hinglish that AIB *(All India Bakchod)*, EIC *(East India Comedy)* etc. use. Then there's always ""Arnub with a U"", which make me a #TVFMolester. *(At this point we, interviewers had no idea what he was talking about. Maybe he was high)*

**Q 4: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>**Masala Moderator**: Little Green book version 2, possibly an AMA with a comedian, conquer Eurasian landmass and then the world. Just the usual stuff. *(Just like the Mongols!)*

*(P.S: all questions were answered by the same moderator.)*

I am a former mormon and would like to submit my favorite community for subreddit of the day. R/exmormon. We've recently have had a huge uptick in subscribers due a TBM (true believing Mormon) bishop, Sam Young. He went on a 23 day hunger strike in protest of child sexual abuse and questions by Mormon bishops and the church's policies that allow this to occur. This last Sunday the Mormon church put him on trial for his ""disobedience"" and will likely be ex-ed in a few days. The tribunal is still deliberating on if they will be excommunicating him but we exmormons suspect the decision has already been made and they just hope for the news cycle to die down.

Today a document was leaked from the headquarters of the church that they have been intentionally hide sexual abuse to avoid ""bad press"". The church cares more about bad press then taking necessary steps to protect children.

I would love to have another spotlight shined on r/exmormon because of the amazing growth we've seen (90k subscribers!) and also help the world see what the Mormon church allows to happen to children.

Onions.  
They're fucking delicious.  
Seriously, just look how sexy [this one is](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnionLovers/comments/9g16s8/this_beauty_i_cooked_yesterday/). I would eat that beauty like an apple. And what about [this fine specimen](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnionLovers/comments/8t8ybx/onion_rings_are_basically_vegetable_doughnuts_and/)? Just when you think onions can't get any better: onion rings. Did you know that there are many opinions on when onion rings were actually invented? Some believe they were invented in the 15th century, some believe they were invented in the 18th century, and some believe they weren't actually around until the last 100 years! Whenever it was, I want to meet the [mad lad](https://www.reddit.com/r/madlads/) who actually took the cross-section of an onion, dipped it in batter, and then went and fucking [deep fried it](http://i.imgur.com/GJES6kB.png). They must've been mental.  
  
Anyway, the subreddit. One day, I was browsing through Reddit when I found a delicious recipe. Let me tell you, this recipe was drop dead gorgeous. As my mouth was already watering at the thought of the taste, wondering if this recipe could get any better, I looked at the ingredients list when I saw it. ""An onion."" My happiness level was through the roof at this point, but then I scrolled down. I saw a 12-page rant in the comments, all about why onions are the most vile food on the planet and how they are apparently ""the cause of the death of everyone who has ever lived"". After I replied how the commenter had immature taste buds and is probably the product of bad parenting, the user replied back to me: ""/r/OnionLovers"". As I scrolled through the subreddit they had linked, I realised that I had found my place, my people.  
  
/r/OnionLovers is a place where onion lovers gather to celebrate the greatest and most versatile vegetable, the onion. All content highlighting the wonderful onion is welcome including but not limited to: images of delicious onions, videos of skilled onion handlers, your favorite recipes with onions, and articles on the benefits of onions. So, yeah, onions are great. [Even Reddit founder /u/spez agrees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6auyq9/reddit_is_procss/dhhn0cz/) But not everyone does, some *""people""* think that onions are vile and awful, namely the people of [/r/OnionHate](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/9jw1r8/september_29th_2018_ronionhate_onions_are_the/). Now, not only are they [idiots](http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=onions), but the mods of [/r/OnionHate](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/9jw1r8/september_29th_2018_ronionhate_onions_are_the/) were [totally **rekt** by /r/KarmaCourt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/5qqjay/ronionlovers_vs_ronionhate_for_slander_hate/dd5g0zh/)     
  
There's not much else to say other than the undeniable truth that ""onions are great"" and that if you agree, this subreddit is for you. And if you disagree, then that's okay, just minimize your hate speech against onions.

Onions.  
They're fucking disgusting.  
Seriously, what other vegetable can literally drive you to tears? I know some people say it drives you to tears because ""they produce the chemical irritant known as syn-propanethial-S-oxide which stimulates the eyes' lachrymal glands so they release tears"" or whatever, but onions (as concluded by research by /u/Kantoros1) are actually [the cause of the death of everyone who has ever lived.](https://www.reddit.com/r/onionhate/comments/6wcqds/i_think_not/) For the most vile food on the planet, they do happen to be loved and put in everything from burgers to soups to cakes. Whose idea was it to put these rancid things in everything? Whoever it was, I want to meet them and smash their face in. Or force them to eat 100 raw onions. Actually, scrap that. The sick fuck would probably enjoy it. They must've been mental. 
  
Anyway, the subreddit. I'm not the only person to hate onions, apparently. One day, I was browsing through Reddit when I found a delicious recipe. Let me tell you, this recipe was drop dead gorgeous. As my mouth was watering at the thought of the taste, I looked at the ingredients list when I saw it. ""An onion."" After having a major panic attack and leaving a 12-page rant in the comments, a user replied to me: ""/r/OnionHate"". As I scrolled through the subreddit they had linked, I realised that I had found my place, my people. /r/OnionHate is the only good hate sub, dedicated to the hatred and [possible eradication](https://www.reddit.com/r/onionhate/comments/93e8l7/excellent_news_in_the_paper_today/) of this awful ""food"". If you are an onion lover and reading this, go ahead and comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onionhate/comments/8jdqh6/if_youre_an_onion_lover_and_want_to_get_banned/) to be banned from the sub. Do it, why waste your time *not* banned from a subreddit dedicated to people shitting all over the thing you love? And not literally, by the way, the people of the subreddit don't physically shit on onions. That would just be too good for the vile thing - to be covered in onion-free feces.  
  
There's not much else to say other than the undeniable truth that ""onions are awful"" and that if you agree, this subreddit is for you. And if you disagree...

**224,495** *Cosplayers* for **10 years!**


/r/Cosplay is a subreddit for photos, how-tos, tutorials, cosplay news, etc. Cosplayers and fans, amateur and professional. The intent of this subreddit is to provide a safe cosplay forum that do not have a comments section steeped in sexualization. It's difficult and subjective to determine what and how that means, especially given the nature of cosplay subject media. 

What is Cosplay? well its a contraction of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear self-made costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term ""cosplay"" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, live-action films, television series and video games. The term ""cosplay"" was coined in Japan in 1984. It was inspired by and grew out of the practice then-known as fan costuming at science fiction conventions.

Whether you are a die hard cosplayer or someone who just wants to browse photos of it /r/Cosplay is the place for you. Here you can find and connect over all things Cosplay. The mods really work hard to make sure this is a safe and welcoming environment for all of those involved. I would highly recommend checking this subreddit out because the cosplay is phenomenal and the community is so welcoming I mean 2 of the main rules of the sub are *Treat everyone with respect* and */r/Cosplay is a place for quality human interation*. I don't know about you but I believe we need a lot more of both in our world these days!

**Here is a taste of what you might find on your journey through /r/Cosplay:**

>##What made you want to mod this sub?

>>**u/fuzzy_one**  For me, I enjoy Reddit and I enjoy the openness, politeness and helpfulness of the cosplay community, so the mix was natural. 


**Another helpful tip here is what the tags mean on each post!**

/r/BoxOffice is a subreddit dedicated to discussing up and coming movies big and small. Here you can find discussions, speculation, debates, theories, and questions regarding how we think a film will do and what we think of how a film did.

I am a huge movie buff, I make it a priority to budget so I can see as many as I can. My interest in box office started when I really enjoyed called ""*Dredd*"" I kept waiting for news of a sequel but it never came so I looked up *(I didn't follow online movie news as closely at this point)* why and found out it was because it didn't make enough to get a sequel green-lighted as soon as I hoped. Since then I have kept an eye on this stuff and always hope films do well so we can keep getting them. 

 

**Box Office** - *used to refer to the commercial success of a movie, play, or actor in terms of the audience size or takings they command. Box office business can be measured in the terms of the number of tickets sold or the amount of money raised by ticket sales (revenue). The projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the creative industries and often a source of interest for fans. This is predominant in the Hollywood movie industry.*  

 





>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/4rollingstock**  I joined the subreddit about a year and a half ago. I’d been interested in the box office for awhile and had been lurking on the sub for some time. I’m glad I made one! 
 
>>**u/mardfet**  I've been interested in box office stuff since like, 2012. It's always been a weird fascination of mine, and I think I started coming on this sub around 2013 when it was still really small.

>##What was it that got you into discussing box office?

>>**u/4rollingstock**  I first got interested in the box office over six years ago when the fantasy epic John Carter was coming out. There were a lot of questions of how well the movie would do with its skyrocketing budget, somewhat obscure source material, confusing marketing, and a director who was just handling making a live-action movie for the first time. In the end, it was the perfect recipe for a disaster, and was a huge flop for Disney. Trying to understand what exactly went wrong with that movie lead me to trying to understand movie financials in general, and starting to learn all about the box office.

>>**u/mardfet**  Just a natural evolution since I've loved movies since I was a kid. I started hearing about all these records being broken by stuff like the original Avengers and was curious what it all meant. 


>##What’s your favorite thing about the community on here?

>>**u/4rollingstock**  Well I love all the debate and differing opinions. The truth about the box office is that nobody really, truly knows what’s going to happen when a movie gets released. Yeah there are estimations by different websites and tracking by the movie industry, but those are just estimates. It’s not uncommon for movies to suprise or underperform what everyone was thinking, one of the biggest examples from this year being Black Panther. Nobody was expecting a 200M domestic opening even just a few days before the movie came out, it was a massive overperformance.
 
>>**u/mardfet**  That it's such a niche, small little community. It's nice because we don't have to deal with too much trouble only because it's just a small group of people with the same fascination over this really kinda obscure thing. I love discussing it but for people who don't have the same experience or frame of reference, it just sounds like numbers. 

>##What’s your favorite thing about being a moderator on here?

>>**u/4rollingstock**  I just really like following the updates every week. Unlike some topics were you’re only getting new news and headlines every once and awhile, there are new movies hitting the box office charts each week, every week of the year. So while there aren’t always megablockbusters coming out, there’s still new stuff to follow each weekend.

>>**u/mardfet**  Probably a lot of overlap with the last question, but just that people are generally chill. We don't attract a lot of trolls since it's just a smaller place, and our main rule is literally just 'don't be a dick'. I personally feel pretty strongly about being against harassment online and like to take steps to making the community better for myself and others. Being able to just remove shitty, mean spirited comments that contribute nothing is pretty nice.


>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/4rollingstock** We’re hoping to wrangle together some AMAs in the future from people who are knowledgeable about the movie industry. While the box office results for movies are right there for anyone to see, trying to understand how those numbers explain a movie’s profitability can be a bit murky, since the studios don’t like to release that information.
 
>>**u/mardfet**  Hopefully continue finding people who find this stuff interesting. We always get a big wave of attention after something like Solo or Justice League, any high-profile flops or whatever, and plenty of people are only there to watch the Hindenburg crash, but there's always some who find the stuff legitimately interesting and will stick around to keep reading about it.  

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/4rollingstock**  I’m really hyped for this December. Since 2015, every holiday season’s box office has been dominated by a Star Wars movie. This is going to be the first year in a bit where that isn’t the case, and boy do the studios seem to know it. Over the one week period from December 14 to December 21, they’re planning to release eight movies, and most of them potentially big blockbusters too - Alita, Aquaman, Bumblebee, Holmes & Watson, Mary Poppins Returns, Mortal Engines, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and Welcome to Marwen. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many big-budgeted movies come out so close to each other. It’s going to be crazy (and really interesting to follow too).

>>**u/mardfet**  I guess just a funny anecdote; before I became a mod here the biggest buzz thing was how Justice League would perform. I half-sarcastically predicted a $98M weekend, which would've been way worse than worst case scenario. Some guy said if that happened he'd give me 5 months of gold. Well, lo and behold, it only opened to $93M, and he actually paid up!

Something that have more drama, masala and banter than an Indian Movie is politics. Indian Politics is all the more dramatic. 

Can't a human being talk about India without all that senseless, circular drama? Ofcourse they can! That's why you need to visit /r/IndiaNonPolitical (or /r/INP)!

The INP community talk about everything India while strictly avoiding any and every politically charged topic - making it quite a wholesome experience. Talk about experiences of travel within to/from India, being stuck in traffic, random stuff late nights, of even about the Indian economy or TV shows. It can be actually quite engaging and fulfilling to talk these subjects, and in detail even contrary to the popular beliefs. 

INP was created due to the constant stress that day-to-day interactions faced because of politics. Most media, social media and web outlets are filled with blaring noise about these subjects. The challenge of the casual netizen was similar to finding the door to exit in a crowded Mumbai local train. In a lot of cases, it would be overwhelming. That's when one of the earlier moderators went 'That's it! We're getting our own real estate on reddit!' and rest is history.

Some of the great features of the subreddit includes their Late Night Discussions ([Like this one here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaNonPolitical/comments/9b9jbh/late_night_thread_are_you_a_mountain_person_or_a/)) which often comes with a topic recommended by one of the subscribers. Others include their Productivity threads - such as [this one here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaNonPolitical/comments/9ac5ea/weekly_progress_productivity_thread_august_26_2018/) which is a place to encourage each other to do better, Investments and Finance threads - [as this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaNonPolitical/comments/999b2r/investments_and_personal_finance_thread_august_22/), and the [Teach Me discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaNonPolitical/comments/99p1jc/teach_me_thursday_biosensors_aug_23_2018/)

The subreddit and the community is a quite place to sit back and enjoy the view. It welcomes all Indians as well as those curious about the country, its culture, progress, and its future. 

**So drop by, grab a Masala Chai or Filter Coffee and come hang out!**

This subreddit is dedicated to discussing Marvel Studios, the films and television shows, and anything else related to the MCU. Just encase you have been living under a rock since 2008 Marvel studios has become one if not the most successful film franchises ever with 20 films and even more coming out in the next few years it looks like this train has no end in sight *(fingers crossed)*.

This all started with *Iron Man* back in 2008 I don't think any of us dreamt this golden age of comic book films would arrive, whether you're into Marvel, DC, Image, ..etc its truly a special time that knock on wood lasts for as long as possible. /r/MarvelStudios is a really awesome sub that has a strong and passionate community. With 10 years of success I really hope we don't take any of this for granted.

I really love interacting and posting on this sub, I've always gotten an extremely warm welcome on here as well as the [sub discord server](https://discord.gg/marvelstudios) even if I tend to frequent the DC films sub /r/DC_Cinematic often, I bring that up because its really awesome I have found the majority of folks on the sub are open and can coexist regardless of if we like one more than the other we are all more similar than we are different as comic book fans. You will find an awesome assortment of posts that on here daily like Fanart, discussions, news, Easter eggs, theories, AMA's...You name it!


They have recently reached an [incredible milestone as a subreddit crossing over 500,000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/9haink/congrats_weve_made_it_to_500000_subscribers/)!

>>**u/Flamma_Man**  I'm most proud of the amount of discussion that we have, which I've personally archived for prosperity on our wiki page. Seriously, when ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was released, we had to make ten separate posts and it resulted in more than 100,000 comments.
 
>>**u/iliekpixels**  I'm most proud of the fact that we can still have civil discussion with a sub of this size. Even at close to half a million, the community seems to be able to have a normal discourse 99% of the time. In my experience most subs turn a little sour after they reach a certain number, but for us that hasn't happened yet and I doubt it will in the future.
 

>##When you think about the MCU which movie comes to mind for you first?

>>**u/Flamma_Man**  It's really a toss up between ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers,"" but ""Iron Man"" did pop in my head first. While ""The Avengers"" really cemented the idea that Marvel Studios was pulling off a cinematic universe, ""Iron Man"" was still the one that started it all with Robert Downey Jr. being the de facto face of the MCU.

>>**u/iliekpixels**  Iron Man. It was the first, it's still (one of) the best and I feel it perfectly represents the whole universe.

 

>##Which upcoming film are you looking forward to most?

>>**u/Flamma_Man**  ""Captain Marvel"" hands down. She's one of my favorite comic book characters and Brie Larson is a fantastic actress. Not to mention I love it when the MCU introduces new heroes.


>>**u/iliekpixels**  Avengers 4, of course. I'm still looking forward to Captain Marvel, but I much more want to see the conclusion of this 10 year/20 movie story. Then again, Captain Marvel is probably going to lead in to A4 in some way.

 
>##Do you have an all time favorite post on the sub? 

>>**u/Flamma_Man**  Hard to choice.

>>[I'd have to pick a more recent one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/97iaoe/til_the_rhinos_in_black_panther_were_all/)

>>Good job on that one, /u/jimcook1

>>**u/iliekpixels**  [This one was pretty good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6rnpiw/captain_america_had_no_idea_about_spidermans/)
 
 

>##And finally is there anything you’d like to say to your subscribers? 

>>**u/Flamma_Man**  You people are wonderful, but you gotta remember to use the search function and to look at ""new"" and the front page first before posting anything!

>>**u/iliekpixels**  If a new trailer drops, there's no need to post it. Please. It's already there, 30 times over, I promise! Think of the children. Aside from that, thank you for being such a great and caring community!

**22,295** Negative Creeps for **9 Years**

&nbsp;

In a time when hair metal ruled the airwaves, a small band from Aberdeen, Washington dared to be different. They ushered in the era of Grunge. Music would never be the same after they released 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' off of their second studio album, Nevermind, in September of 1991. Nevermind would go on to be one of the best selling albums in history.

The band has garnered tons of acclaim and is still an incredibly recognizable band. I have been listening to them since my early teen years and no matter where I am if a song comes on I will take a moment to rock out and appreciate the music that they created. Nirvana also had the honor of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, their first year of eligibility.

/r/Nirvana keeps the spirit and fandom going. Featuring AMA from people who have worked with the band. Fan created content, cover songs and art. To see a fans still staying together through the years is amazing.

&nbsp;

**Lets hear from the Mods of /r/Nirvana**
&nbsp;
>**1. Whats it like moderating /r/Nirvana?**
>>**/u/kinggutter:** It's an honor to be even the tiniest part of the Nirvana legacy. I get to spend time with fans of a band that changed music history, as well as be in constant contact with the four other moderators who have become like brothers to me.

>>**/u/AcousticTie:** It is a humbling and rewarding experience, you never know what kind of art or demo or collage can surface next.

>>**/u/slavethewhales:** Everyone (for the most part) is super cool to each other and is like a little family with lots of familiar faces. Many regulars with continuing relationships that makes visiting the sub a joy.

>**2. When did you first get into the band?**
>>**/u/kinggutter:** I was lucky enough to hear the radio premier of Smells Like Teen Spirit on B97.1, a New Orleans based top 40 station, and it was one of those moments where I knew that my life would never be the same afterward.

>>**/u/AcousticTie:** Freshman year of high school. After years of saturation by my Granmothers records; The Beatles, Beach boys, Hermanns Hermits and the like, my friend showed me the Sub Pop video for In Bloom. The rest is History!

>>**/u/slavethewhales:** My uncle had Nevermind when it came out and I would listen to his CDs all the time. That one was in heavy rotation for me back then.

>**3. What is your favorite song?**
>>**/u/kinggutter:** Radio Friendly Unit Shifter from the In Utero album. Every time I hear it, I can vividly see the '93 Live and Loud performance: Dave counting off to start the song, Kurt's hair blowing in the wind as he begins playing, Krist jumping up and down as he plays his bass, and Pat taking the last drag of his cigarette and tossing it before the whole band launches into what I feel is their defining song.

>>**/u/AcousticTie:** ""About A Girl"". It was also the reason I learned how to play guitar. You know what, ""Opinion"" is a right banger too.

>>**/u/slavethewhales:** This is obviously a tough one to answer, but right now I'm feeling ""Scentless Apprentice."" Super heavy and catchy.

>**4. Favorite piece of Nirvana trivia?**
>>**/u/kinggutter:** If music didn't workout for Kurt, he had every intention of moving to Hollywood to become a stunt man.

>>**/u/AcousticTie:** Evan after success, Kurt Coabin still drove an old 1965 Dodge dart

>>**/u/slavethewhales:** The fact that Bleach cost just over $600 to record back in the day.

>**5. Favorite posts on the sub?**
>>**/u/kinggutter:** A while back, /u/BonaFideComputerGeek painstakingly went through every album and pitted each song against one another March Madness style in a series of about 50 threads. It was so much fun discussing the merits of every single one of Nirvana's songs, and it was a great way to keep the community engaged.

>>**/u/AcousticTie:** Anything that a user created themselves. Either a cover, and artpiece, or poster- it is proof that Nirvana still inspires people to create, 30 Years later.

>>**/u/slavethewhales:** I'm going to echo what /u/Gredgex said and go with the Elmo posts. Hope he makes a return someday.

>**6. What do you want to say to your current and future subscribers?**
>>**/u/kinggutter:** To the current subscribers: Thank you for keeping us alive, and thank you for being you. We couldn't do this without you, and we hope that you continue to believe that we can always do better. Thank you for keeping our feet to the fire! To anyone that is considering visiting/subscribing: We hope that you enjoy your time with us, and we double hope that you decide to find a home in our humble community. Please feel free to jump right in with making posts and commenting until your heart is content.

>>**/u/AcousticTie:** hank you, and- Buy the music! People pirate and use Spotify too much, Go out and buy the records because not only is it the least we can do for this incredible band, but there are a few people that real sales still support.

>>**/u/slavethewhales:** I LOVE YOU GUYS

>**7. Anything else you'd like to add?**
>>**/u/kinggutter:** I would like to give special thanks to: [Aaron Burckhard](https://www.facebook.com/aaron.burckhard), [Craig Montgomery](https://www.reddit.com/user/craigmont924), [Gillian Gaar](https://twitter.com/GillianGaar), [Lori Goldston](http://lorigoldston.com/), and [Dancing Tony](https://www.facebook.com/Tony.The.Interpretive.Dancer/).

>>**/u/AcousticTie:** My fellow moderators have become almost brothers. I have to thank them too!

>>**/u/slavethewhales:** Everyone who has been involved with the band that we've been in contact with (those who /u/kinggutter mentioned) have all been just the coolest people. It makes it that much easier to moderate when everyone involved is so awesome and cool.

"September 23rd, 2018 - /r/bisexual: Celebrate Bi Visibility Day!",526,9i7vde,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/9i7vde/september_23rd_2018_rbisexual_celebrate_bi/,61,"####/r/bisexual  
  
**97,680** subscribers for **9 years!**  
   
/r/bisexual is a subreddit for discussion and support for, as the sidebar puts it, 'the ""shades of gray"" in what is often assumed to be one or the other', such as: bisexuals, pansexuals, omnisexuals, asexuals, and anyone who falls in between the otherwise binary labels of ""straight"" or ""gay"".   
  
I was going to talk a lot about the in-jokes and touching posts, but I think it'd be more sincere and genuine to hear from mods and members of /r/bisexual!  
   
>##1. Why did you join the subreddit?   

>>**/u/electric-blue** I joined a few months after coming out as bi, mainly to share my experiences, and sometimes offer/ask for advice.   
  
>>**/u/lookmanofilter** It was the first large-scale bi community I had ever encountered, and it excited me that so many people were like me and proud of it.  
  
>>**/u/raecall** I stumbled across this subreddit as I was in the midst of figuring out my sexuality. Past the point of questioning, I was more in the ohshiti’mbiwhatnow frame of mind. Finding such a supportive subreddit (shoutout to the famous “yes, you are bi!” post that came at a ridiculously appropriate time) and the amazing, affirming, diverse, vital users, and I was hooked. This is a sub where people come with their problems and victories and happiness and heartache. It’s the reason I made a reddit account. It’s the first place I felt like me.  
  
>>**/u/BiFrosty** I recently accepted the fact that I am bisexual. I'm a 29 years old male, happily married. It can be an incredibly hard thing to come to terms with after living your whole life in fear of being ""discovered"". Of course this is related to feelings of internalized homophobia / biphobia. Anyways... what I guess I'm getting at is that discovering who you are and accepting that can be a very confusing and difficult process. Sometimes what you need is the direct support and shared stories of hardship to know you're not alone, that there's other people facing similar struggles in their life. Its shared stories of support that better yourunderstanding of yourself. But a lot of it is also the puns (and other light hearted enjoyment) found here, I'm not going to lie. :)
  
>>**/u/JacKiethHuntsman** Why do you think?  
  
>##2. What's moderating the sub like?  

>>**/u/electric-blue**  If you can get over the daily drip of homophobia, its heartwarming to see people share their happy experiences on the sub.  

>>**/u/lookmanofilter** Besides the occasional troll, it's fairly straightforward. There's no infighting within the community, and I think we're just big enough that we still see ourselves as a tightly-knit community. Due to this, the community is largely self-moderated. We just step in occasionally when we need to.  
  
>>**/u/Embarrassinghuman** It's usually pretty easy but there are definitely some days where it's more frustrating than anything. It's definitely worth it though.
  
>##3. What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?  

>>**/u/electric-blue**  My favourite posts are honestly the coming out posts I keep seeing. Its amazing to see people come to love themselves, and see their growth often aided with people on the subreddit.  
  
>>**/u/lookmanofilter** [This is an all-time favorite of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/2rxfhg/hi_rchess_i_was_told_to_study_tactics_and_i_have/). [This one as well, it's just so innocent.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/6g1gwz/well_thats_one_way_to_come_out_to_your_sister/) 
  
>>**/u/raecall** I freaking love anything about lemon bars. One well known user, Tux, started welcoming all the bi babies with lemon bars. It was random, it was funny. It caught on. Now lemon bars are the bisexual sweet treat. And my closeted ass gets a kick out of serving them to my family.  
  
>>**/u/_eowyn_** Absolutely the [""Yes, you are bi."" stickied post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/6yzcsv/yes_you_are_bi/). It was the first thing I saw when I opened the subreddit and it felt like it was speaking straight to my soul. Although I experienced a lot of self doubt in the following months, reading that post title was the first time I really identified as bisexual.  
  
>>**/u/Embarrassinghuman** I love all the wholesome coming out posts and how supportive our community can be when someone is struggling.  
  
>>**/u/troikoveron** Not specifically but in general, the posts about people who just want to tell us how lovely we are. It's a nice positive feedback loop.  
  
>##4. Anything else you would like to add?  

>>**/u/electric-blue**  Thanks for giving us the opportunity to be subreddit of the day on Bi Visibility day!  
  
>>**/u/lookmanofilter** I'm really happy to be part of moderating this community. Although there's not a ton of work for the mods, I feel like I'm making a difference in the lives of at least a few people, which is important to me.  
  
>>**/u/problematic_lemons** Bi erasure is real. For both me and my friend, we hadn't come out because we had no experience with women and didn't feel it counted in a sense. Joining this community made me realize that there is no one experience of being bisexual, that my experience is quite common, and that the more people who are openly bisexual and dispelling stereotypes about us the better. Being a part of this community has helped me be honest to my friends about myself and tremendously improved my mental health and my confidence.  
  
>>**/u/Hamburgex** For me this is a beautiful community full of beautiful people. I would like to thank every member of /r/bisexual because they have helped me find myself!

#But why is bi visibility important?  
  
Increasing inclusion and visibility of bisexuals helps get rid of the negative stereotypes and misconceptions of bisexuality and bisexuals. It is a fact that people who are bisexual are more at risk of experiencing anxiety, 
depression and suicidal thoughts. While the cause of this correlation is not definitively known as of yet, a [study](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11121-017-0804-2?author_access_token=HmXzCxYOGPXlpyLFkEh2Sfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY69fGsGy82K2F-qKswjcCp_4lquu_M_wYRCb68kZNDamLFIvZBapABKj2WauzK0QwYj51DicENdDF4V1osJGNKNJ7f4EV4qD7AeKrzNK6d3Ww==) published in Prevention Science found that these risks are exacerbated because bisexual people feel as if they don’t belong in any one community. The reason they are alienated is often due to the negative stereotypes and misconceptions, and bi visibility helps get rid of these, in turn helping lower the risk of those who are bisexual experiencing anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.    

Nobody should have to prove their own existence, but just for the fun of it here's a couple debunked:  
  
* ""Bisexuality is just a phase.""   
(It is not. In [a paper published in Developmental Psychology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194000), the results clearly showed that bisexuality was not a transitional period. Over a period of ten years, a sample of women with varying identities were followed. Very few women who had identified as bisexual in adolescence changed their identity to either straight or lesbian by the end of the study - only 8% of that group did so. Rather, bisexual women were consistently sexually fluid over time, maintaining attractions to both genders, to varying degrees, over the course of a decade.)  
  
* ""There's no such thing as bisexuality - you can't be attracted to men *and* women!""  
([Here's a study](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/the-male-bisexuality-debate-revisited-some-bisexual-men-have-bise) regarding straight, gay, and bisexual men which shows clearly that it's not.)    
  
*****  

To get an idea of the sub at its best, these are the top three posts of all time:  
  
1. [BI_IRL](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/81dshd/bi_irl/) (8298 upvotes, 120 comments)  
2. [""Oh no, the french are invading france""🤔](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/7reblw/oh_no_the_french_are_invading_france/) (8290 upvotes, 494 comments)  
3. [You're not BIlingual](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/6pbi5l/youre_not_bilingual/) (5490 upvotes, 107 comments)

**600** *Deep Thinkers* for **11 Months!**



**Support for those experiencing an existential crisis. A place to ask questions, spark discussion, and engage with a community of supportive people.**

/r/ExistentialSupport was created in response to the large number of self-help posts submitted to the subreddit dedicated to existentialist philosophy. We are a growing community of thoughtful and supportive people who are either experiencing or have experienced existential crises and general depressive thoughts. We invite you to join our sub and spark discussions about the philosophy of life and existence, and to ask for or offer support in Reddit's most existentially supportive community!

Top Posts:

*  [Anyone else shook to their core by existence itself?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialSupport/comments/7d5hvi/anyone_else_shook_to_their_core_by_existence/)

*  [Can you help me get over a existential crisis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialSupport/comments/8eahcs/can_you_help_me_get_over_a_existential_crisis/)

*  [How to prevent existential dread and gain purpose](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialSupport/comments/985s5r/how_to_prevent_existential_dread_and_gain_purpose/)

I like to think of this sub as a place to have casual conversations about any existential thoughts we might have throughout our day or week. There are no prerequisites to posting. It's not a debate sub, or a sub dedicated to academic pursuits. There are no such things as ""dumb questions"" here, since it is often the most basic questions about life and existence that start a crisis. Since nobody is immune to these thoughts, our community is naturally diverse in appearance, location, age and ideology. If you're having any troubling thoughts about existence, or if you want to offer support to people who could use it, please join us. 

**Remember: life beings on the other side of despair.**

**2,191** for **9 months**

*'allo mate! Let's talk Australia in an unrestricted and mutually-respectable way!*

Australia_ was inspired by the want for an open space to discuss everything Australia. We invite all Australians to share their thoughts, discuss ideas, news and events without much interference by them them pesky mods. We'll just prolly grab a beer and holler along with you. We only expect we are excellent to each other.

Australia is a vast land with a young history, and we have lot more to offer apart from them 'roos and stevie, the crocodile hunter. Our tastes and humor can indeed be strange at times, but its all good! You'll love our sub as much as you'll enjoy the darling downs.

Some of our popular posts include [circlejerk about le ol' circlejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Australia_/comments/8mxa6c/do_you_enjoy_my_australian_meme/), some great [aussie humor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Australia_/comments/8tv6w2/it_pays_to_advertise/), and [some more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Australia_/comments/96dvs5/legos_meh/), and [lots more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Australia_/comments/8j2rpq/when_americans_eat_tablespoons_of_vegemite_and/). We also discuss news, maymays and things that ... well... might be hard to explain in plain English. 

We look forward to any kind of Aussie content; be it politics, music, local events, fun places to hang out, adventure sports, wildlife or even Footie! And remember it is not just limited to this. We'd like us Australians to have a sub like our country, open and welcoming.  

Cheers!

-------------


We had an interview with the creator (/u/bannelong) and mod team (/u/jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj) of the subreddit:


**Q:Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>**Bannelong** The main country subreddit has a bad reputation for banning people and deleting posts that do not align with the views of the mods. We wanted to provide an alternative where all political views are welcome. We allow all things, including those the main subreddit does not allow, like YouTubes, pictures, memes, discussion threads, opinions, jokes, bizarre news stories as well as political and news articles.

>**16 Js:** I joined because I was tired of politics invading every subreddit I was in. The largest Australian sub is largely dominated by one extreme side of politics and everything has a political slant there - by my last reckoning nearly 50% of new posts are deleted immediately, many for no given reason. On top of that, with all the conflict about Trump and US politics, politics were becoming pervasive in most of my favorite subreddits, and always divided on one side of the other. I wanted a place where I could come that would represent everyone in my country. We don’t discriminate based on politics (I’m probably more right leaning, /u/Bennelong is probably more left).

**Q: What's moderating the sub like?**

>**Bannelong:** Mostly it is fairly relaxed, and the discussions are quite civil, but we get the occasional racists and hate mongers who insist that we should tolerate their intolerance of others. Out of the two thousand subscribers we have at present, we have only had to ban about ten.The basic rule is that you can criticize any religion or political ideology, but you can't vilify the people who follow a religion or the citizens of a country. I have actually had people I have banned thank me for being fair when I banned them.

> **16 Js:** Pretty chilled out to be honest. We mostly partake as mods by getting into conversations.

**Q:What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?** 

>**Bannelong:**The best posts are the nonsensical ones, like a picture of a chocolate cake or the sauce at the local supermarket that tasted like Macca’s Big Mac Special Sauce. We have also had good discussions about bike riders riding in the main traffic lanes instead of the designated bike lanes, or the ban on protesting outside abortion clinics.

>**16 Js** I’m a sucker for meme posts. Posts like [this one] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Australia_/comments/8id7no/you_know_the_party_is_going_to_be_lit_when/ ) make my day. We also get a lot of people sharing genuine local knowledge, and a lot of people loving the politically neutral theme of the sub. I like that people can say what they think.

**Q: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>**Bannelong:** We want this to be a place where people can come to find out what Australia is really like, and to tell us what they think about Australia. We want more people to know about us. We want more people to realize that they can express their opinions in a thread without getting downvoted into oblivion, abused by others or their comments deleted because it isn't the opinion of the mods. We want more people ta take part in the discussions and to start threads that are of interest to them.

> **16 Js:** To grow - /r/Australia_ will snowball in conversation as size increases. We grew quickly up to this point and we’ve started to reach a level where we are getting some great conversation and regulars that contribute a lot. I’d (personally) like us to be there for the group of Australians that aren’t hardcore into left politics, but also want something more serious than /r/straya conversations (no knocking that sub - I love it).

**Q: Do you have a message for reddit?**

>**Mod team & Community:** Even if you’re not from Australia, drop by. We love visitors!

**I asked the moderators of /r/Fitness a few questions here are their answers!**


>##How did you find the sub?

>>**u/purplespengler**  I just kinda found it I guess.
 
>>**u/eric_twinge**  There weren't that many subs back then. honestly I probably just searched for 'fitness'. 
>##What made you want to be a mod?

>>**u/purplespengler**  I told lots of people to read the FAQ, and then one day I was invited to be a mod.
 
>>**u/eric_twinge**  I was already spending a lot of time here. The ability to clean up the riff raff and make it a better place for people seemed like a win win.

>##Whats your favorite thing about the community?

>>**u/purplespengler**  The small but dedicated cadre of regular posters who help out the stumbling, bumbling newbies with great dedication.
 
>>**u/eric_twinge**  The incredibly smart and experienced people that keep coming back to steer clueless noob onto the right path.
>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/purplespengler**  Continuing to improve our Wiki and FAQ to be high quality, reliable hubs for fitness information.
 
>>**u/eric_twinge**  I've been saying this for years but someday we're going to start doing community wide contests or competitions.

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/purplespengler**  I can't think of anything.

**34,023** *Gal Gadot Fans* for **5 years!**

/r/GalGadot is an image based subreddit dedicated to Gal Gadot an Israeli actress and model, born and raised in Israel. At age 18, she was crowned Miss Israel 2004. She then served two years in the Israel Defense Forces as a combat instructor, and began studying law and international relations at IDC Herzliya college while building up her modeling and acting careers.



I am a huge fan of Gal Gadot its one of the reasons I wanted to become a mod for this subreddit. It was awesome to get to talk to other fans and appreciate how *Wonder*ful she is and how great that smile is. Overall the community is extremely welcoming but you know, there is always a knuckle head that tries to ruin the time but speaking from experience from someone on the mod team we work hard to keep it clean and as respectful as possible here on /r/GalGadot. 


With her star skyrocketing since being cast as Wonder Woman this is the best time to check out this sub especially as she's busy filming the sequel as you're reading this. I know these image based subreddits tend to have a bad reputation but this is a safe for work sub that respects the actress that its dedicated to. We do not allow Photoshop edits, vulgar or classless comments or titles for posts either. While its an image based subreddit if big news happens we will allow some news posts to be posted as well since we are celebrating Gal.

Gal Gadot's first film role came as Gisele Yashar in The Fast and the Furious film franchise. She went on to earn worldwide fame for portraying Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe, beginning with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), followed by the solo film Wonder Woman and the ensemble Justice League (both 2017). In 2018, Gadot was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Like many of you, during lonely nights I was dreaming about my own cozy subreddit. The idea of community where people share your ideas and passion for something was inspiring me for a very long period of time.

Like many of you, I used to visit lots of oversexed subreddits created mostly for gaining karma via posting women's bodies. Subreddits like those are probably the reason why Reddit became so popular but they begin to really bore much faster than you could ever expect.

Like many of you, I value the beauty of women we can see on our huge TVs and monitors. Nevertheless, the whole Reddit is mainly concerned about prominent parts of their bodies and totally lack of one incredible thing. Portraits.

Unlike many of you I used to collect portraits of famous women I like on my phone. Portraits of Emma Watson, Daisy Ridley, Cobie Smoulders and others pleased my eyes during long and lonely nights. And then I suddenly realized that Here is the Thing! Here is the idea for SFW subreddit where man and women of reddit can enjoy something spoiled around the whole WEB in one place. The portraits of our favorite actresses in high quality.

Because of my profile fulfilled all requirements to create my very first own subreddit, I pressed the button, filled the input areas and here we are. I posted over 10 portraits I had on my phone and suddenly... subscriber! And upvote! Man... that was absolutely wild feeling... In a few hours we got about 20 subscribers and lots of upvotes. And then I recieve a message. ""I have an amazing idea. You should call your subreddit r/PortraitsPorn, it sounds much better than r/studioportraits...""

Was he right? Who knows... But we received more than 500 grateful subscribers in a few hours and many gratitudes. The moment when we receive the ""Thank you"" letter in response to our promo in other subreddits amazed us and allowed us to realize that this sub is more than just content we upload. The subreddit is the community of people who share the same passion. In our case the passion for women's eyes shining in front of studio lighting.

We're a hobbyist sub, but for an item that many people own despite not considering it a hobby. Consequently, after you start learning about them, you find yourself looking at people's wrist in the real world all the time. Sometimes a watch tells you very much about its wearer, othertimes, not so much, but it's fun to think about.

In a digital world where everyone carries a cell phone or sits in front of a computer screen, watches aren't strictly necessary. Maybe that's why some people are drawn to them. There's something romantic and old timey about them. Especially considering the variation favored by enthusiasts are almost exclusively mechanical watches. That is, watches with no electrical component, that instead runs entirely on gears and springs. Though technically inferior in almost every way to quartz watches, there's nothing inspiring about the robotic tick-tick-tick of a battery powered watch, or even worse, a digital display. But there's something undeniably intriguing and mysterious about the slow, smooth, methodical sweep of a mechanical second hand.

Like most hobbies, watches run the gamut from cheap to expensive. But the price range here is actually quite large, from a cheap $15 Timex all the way up to pricy pieces that run in the hundreds of thousands. Consequently, you get a pretty diverse crowd as well, as we have members in our community representing both those extremes, and every step in between.

Submissions tend to fall into a few distinct buckets.

There's obviously the common, ""What watch should I buy for my budget?"" type recommendation posts, though those probably wouldn't be of much interest to a mainstream audience.

&nbsp;

**But here are a few other memorable posts for me:**

[My Blizzard in a blizzards](https://i.redd.it/orkp8ts5q9801.jpg)

[My girlfriends thoughts on some watches](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/7iu8qi/watchthoughts_my_girlfriends_thoughts_on_some/) - This user did 3-4 of these I think

####/r/GlobalTalk 

**46,054** in **30 days**

It all started [from an ask reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/92lq03/whats_going_on_on_the_nonenglish_parts_of_the/e36xd5q/?sh=a6f25274&st=JLG44K8F) with some curious world citizens and redditors pondering about what's happening elsewhere in the world?

After an interesting discussion by a group of people that has a large viewership, ask reddit, it was discovered that there were so many who pondered about such questions. If you are one of those who felt 'What are things happening around the world that I am not made aware of by the popular or alternate media outlets?' or 'What am I missing because I don't know other languages of the world?' then your are not alone. This subreddit came into being because there are thousands who thought that way. 

Not surprisingly, the subreddit become one of the fastest subreddits to hit 10k subscribers and more. Ofcourse, there is a lot of work to do with respect to design, layout and the regulars acclimatizing to this interesting experience. 

While having a global discussion space is not unheard of as we are aware of examples like world news, a more relaxed and freer exchange of ideas and views seemed to elude the readers and lurkers. As they say, when there is a demand, the supply will deliver. 

So, if you live in a corner of the world and would like to tell us a story that's happening around you or if you'd like to know of stories from around the world - this is the place to hang out! Weather it be to know the [success of the Netherlands in sustainable agriculture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/9aomkx/netherlands_how_the_netherlands_feeds_the_world/), [a quirky pro-LGBT rights advertisement by the Swedish military](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/92o15r/advertisement_made_by_the_swedish_military/), [The bravery of a man in Nigeria fighting off armed herdsmen](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/93d4d7/nigeria_a_man_saved_almost_300_people_from_an/) or just discussing with all the peoples of the world regarding [your local taxi vs Uber competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/95rx19/global_how_is_it_the_taxi_vs_uber_war_going_on/).


Perhaps there is hope for the new world when we see people-to-people interaction is no longer channeled by what Diplomats talk to each other, what MSM tells you, or what you tell your friends in World of Warcraft. It is always interesting to see what people have to say and the new ideas that will come up from this. 

/r/GlobalTalk is a positive step in that bright future. We hope they continue to keep that flame alive with their participation and enthusiasm.  

--------------

Additionally, we had an interview with the creator of the subreddit, **u/BaymerOne** and one of its Mods, **u/indi_n0rd**:

**Q 1: Why did you start/join the sub?**

>**BaymerOne:** I created the sub because the original askreddit post. It asked what English speakers were missing out on in the non-English speaking parts of the internet. It amazed me how much “smaller news” we were missing out on because of language barriers or other. Thus, with the help of many people, /r/GlobalTalk was born.

>**Indi_n0rd** (Paraphrased): Honestly, There are countless other Redditors are in a way pissed off with the global content that rarely makes it way to front page. One any average day, one cursory glance at worldnews and you will find these events dominating the discourse:  
  - Trump, and his plans to sanction some random country.  
 - Putin, Putin, Putin  
- China China, Korea Korea, nukes nukes and the world is doomed.

>Secondly, the news tab on your Reddit app is littered with local news from US, in spite of the fact that they have their own subreddit (r/news). They have somehow managed to enter r/nottheonion, r/worldnews, etc. To top it all off, the blatant censorship of some-to-most country based subreddits have created a broken and biased view (borderline circlejerk) of their nation to outsiders (you know what I am talking about).
 
>There is a great dearth of subreddits where users can share and discuss content which hardly makes it way to the world stage or the front page. Things like culture, language, local but special or bizarre events that can evoke a range of emotions - apart from the usual apathy, hate and disgust - is greatly missing.

>This seems like a wonderful first step to change the norm.

**Q 2: What’s modding like?**

>**BaymerOne**: Tough, but fun! The hardest part is adjusting to moderating. A lot of us, including myself, have minimal moderating experience. The mod team was selected because of their thinking skills and language abilities. I knew if I chose great people to mod, despite mod experience, they could learn and excel! Fun because I’m learning new things about different countries every day.

>**Indi_n0rd**: To be honest it isn't quite the chore that I expected it to be. Over two weeks have passed since subreddit's formation and we have hardly swung our banhammer (save for few annoying bots). One thing we never really expected was civility our subscribers have maintained while participating in discussions (exceptions again) which I guess is a common occurrence in any small subreddits


**Q 3: What are your Favorite posts?**

>**BaymerOne**: Any post asking about other countries. For example, there was a post asking what weird items were included in their local McDonald’s. 

>**Indi_n0rd**: I'll just link them to ya! Here is [one about a call the Spanish Police received](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/94jiot/spain_police_gets_a_call_about_a_tiger_in/), and here is [one about an eccentric bicyclist](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/93cv10/germany_naked_bicyclist_caught_by_traffic_camera/) and finally here is one [wet chase by the German Police](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/94jiik/germany_police_chase_in_pedal_boat/)

**Q4: So what are your Future plans for the subreddit?**

>**Whole Team**: Continue to provide fun local content to every user across the globe! To do this we’re constantly trying to improve everything from motivating users to post local content to getting a nice, simple CSS theme.

and finally, 

**Q 5: Anything else that you'd like to tell everyone?**

>**Whole Team**: Not necessarily related to the interview but I just want to say thank you to all the other /r/GlobalTalk staff and readers. This sub wouldn’t be what it is if it wasn’t for all the amazing help and work they’ve poured into it.

**8,000** haters for **1 Year!**

/r/WaspHating is a subreddit that embraces your hatred of wasps, hornets, bees, and yellow jackets. But not honeybees or bumblebees! Those bees are great.

Check out a detailed guide[ here](https://i.redd.it/gyrbfqium1h11.jpg), or a simplified guide[ here](https://redd.it/8vokkn) to inform yourself about the different wasp-like insects of the world. As you can tell in the guides, not all yellow stripey things are evil. But some, like wasps, are.

From experience, most of the people on the /r/WaspHating subreddit can tell you first hand how much they hate wasps. Many have been painfully stung,[ like this kitty](https://redd.it/9caqh2). Some can have painful or allergic reactions to wasps, while others simply hate their aggressive nature. Most, if not all subscribers on the sub have a negative personal connection to wasps, and will not hesitate to tell you about it.

Since the people on the subreddit hate wasps with a passion, there is a lot of quality content on the sub. Some notable wasp-hating content that you can find on the subreddit may include:

* [I had a wasp nest in my attic a couple of years ago. I waged a war against those fuckers and made jewelry out of their corpses](https://redd.it/8ujlej)
* [Bitch got what she deserved.](https://redd.it/9bkx4p)
* [Who here hates wasps but loves bees?](https://redd.it/8jxe92)
* [Rest in Hell](https://redd.it/9a8b95)

After seeing the intensity of hate against wasps on the sub, I decided to interview the mods about it.

># 1. Why was this subreddit created?

>>u/fraxinuscavum I can actually answer this as I was a part of it. It was founded after I made a comment in this ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/6r907z/dragonfly\_feeds\_on\_bottom\_half\_of\_wasp\_as\_the\_top/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/6r907z/dragonfly_feeds_on_bottom_half_of_wasp_as_the_top/) ) thread.  
 
>>u/maybesaydie I'm not sure why this subreddit was created because I'm not the creator. I would presume it was because Wasps are creepy, scary insects. One day this sub was on my front page and there was a mod post looking for mods, I asked and they added me. Most of the time this sub is quiet but every few months we'll trend and more wasp haters come to share their revulsion.

>## 2. What makes a wasp worse than other insects?

>>u/fraxinuscavum The general consensus is that wasps are extremely aggressive, and are a general problem in more urban and suburban areas. Bees are our friends. We hate getting stung by them, but respect them for their great contributions to mother nature. What differentiates them from ""wasps"" is their primarily less aggressive behavior, and noticeable benefits (pollination, honey and wax production) whereas wasps, which do provide some benefits such as quickly disposing of corpses and dead bugs, are generally angry and don't provide much in return.  
 
>>u/maybesaydie  Wasps are yellow and black, which is a scary color combination. They get ornery as the summer wears on and there are more and more of them living in either their nests or hiding in ground and they're very easily aroused. German Hornets are the ones I dislike the most. They use pheromones to communicate their desire to kill all threats to their nests. So, if one wasp wants to sting you, all the wasps want to sting you. Their stings hurt a lot and they can keep stinging you, unlike the bee which takes its shot and then dies.

>## 3. What fuels the community’s hatred of wasps?

>>u/fraxinuscavum The community is fueled by people that also see wasps as an unnecessarily painful and aggressive species, in addition to the nuisance they provide. Many people have been stung by wasps. Many have been stung by bees. Few have been stung by the same bee twice, while many have been stung by the same wasp twice. Or thrice. And they release a pheromone when they sting or are harmed, which attracts other wasps to fight. They send out scouts looking for a fight. Bees send out scouts looking for the best sources of nectar.

>## 4. Do you have any personal anecdotes about wasps that you would like to share?

>>u/fraxinuscavum  Personally, I don't have a terrible reaction to bees, but I do react to wasps. They can bite and sting you. They carry nasty bacteria on their jaws, and their venom is the type that you don't build immunity to. You react worse. I swell up if I'm stung by a wasp, and the next time might be a hospital visit. There are plenty of pollinators and decomposers in nature, and there isn't a need for such an aggressive variety.  
 
>>u/maybesaydie When I moved into my current residence we had wasps showing up randomly in the upstairs bedrooms. This lead to many evenings of frantic swatting and screaming children. I couldn't afford an exterminator so I decided to track them down and kill the myself. It turned out that they'd been nesting under the cedar siding on the south side of the house. When the sun warmed up the nest every day they poured out. So I waited for a cloudy day, got up on the tallest ladder we owned and hit the under side of the siding with three cans of wasp spray. I made three passes and every time I did, wasps fell like rain. It was like a horror movie. But it was effective because we haven't had any in the house for a few years.

>## 5. What is your opinion on bees?

>>u/fraxinuscavum Bees are our friends. We hate getting stung by them, but respect them for their great contributions to mother nature. What differentiates them from ""wasps"" is their primarily less aggressive behavior, and noticeable benefits (pollination, honey and wax production) whereas wasps, which do provide some benefits such as quickly disposing of corpses and dead bugs, are generally angry and don't provide much in return.  
  
>>u/maybesaydie Bees are kind, useful and give us honey while they pollinate our fruits and vegetables. If you leave them alone they will do nothing bad to you. BE KIND TO BEES WE NEED THEM. Pesticides have been very bad for our bee friends and they don't seem to do anything bad to wasps. It's unfair.

If you didn't hate wasps already, the mods probably changed your mind. Fellow wasp haters, unite! Join the fight against wasps at /r/WaspHating.

/r/JoeRogan is a sub about the prolific American stand-up comedian, martial arts color commentator and podcast host. The sub describes itself as a portal to discuss Joe Rogan, Comedy, MMA, Psychedelics, Mind-expanding revelations, Conspiracies, Insights, and Fitness & Health.


I found this subreddit about a month or two after I fell into a you tube wormhole where I happened to stumble upon an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience with guest [Bryan Callen](https://networthpost.org/wp-content/uploads/profiles/2016/08/Bryan-Callen-net-worth.jpeg). I was immediately entranced by their comradery and the variety of topics they covered over the course of three hours. The sub is a good representation of the the podcast it has it's shit posts, its serious and introspective moments. 

They also have wonderful episode discussion threads for every episode of JRE (Joe Rogan Experience) and MMA Podcast. [They have a list on the side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/8edvc8/jre_and_mma_podcast_guest_list/) that they update with new podcasts, but because of limitations of reddit.com, they have to trim off older guests. Going to keep this post updated as well. If you decide to delve deeper into the Joe Rogan wormhole  you should check out some of Joe Rogans friends podcasts as well!

I started listening to the podcast because it is good, long form content. I like that Rogan can run an interview for 3 hours and I'm still interested in listening.
 
>>**u/OnlySleepsWithAFanOn**  I'd never seen or listened to a podcast I enjoyed, then Joe went live with Alex Jones and it was the most hilariously glorious podcast I'd ever witnessed. I was hooked.  

>>**u/loki_racer**  I happened to find it in the very early days and got hooked. 

>#Who has been your favorite guess on The Joe Rogan Experience?

>>**u/loki_racer**  I can't pick a favorite. People with amazing life experiences that aren't trying to sell me something or are just a talking head. Uncle Joey, Jocko, etc. all have great life stories.

>>**u/OnlySleepsWithAFanOn**  I personally enjoy the expert guests who are super nerdy. Dr. Rhonda Fitzpatrick, The Weinstein Brothers, etc. However, I also get my tickle from guests like Tom Delonge and Alex Jones because there is no level of comedic character commitment higher than those men.

>>**u/AccurateLine**  I have listened to all 1160+ episodes so choosing a favorite is almost impossible. My favorite era was without a doubt the fleshlight era. There was something about starting the podcast with an ad for a fake vagina that set the tone of the podcast early. Certainly Duncan Trussell, Ari Shaffir and Russell Brand are 3 of my faves. 

>#What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/loki_racer**  Again, so hard to pick. The sub is a crazy mix of trees, tifu, ama and a dozen other subs that I wouldn't normally subscribe to. I like threads with deep discussions.

>>It's twisted, but I enjoy users bitching about the mods, because we are such an easy going crew. People accuse us of all kinds of madness, but I really think we are all the type of people you'd enjoy grabbing a drink with.

>>**u/OnlySleepsWithAFanOn**  When you see a thread that is just entirely inside jokes and memes about Joe and his guests, but to an outsider would look like just a random incoherent discussion, it's entirely possible that I'm laughing my ass off.


>>**u/AccurateLine**  Back when we hit 10K subs we held a new banner contest which was fun. I also like all ""the mods are nazi"" posts. 

>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/loki_racer**  The mod team doesn't steer the direction of the sub.

>>**u/OnlySleepsWithAFanOn**  Continue to watch it grow. We don't curate content.

>>**u/lAccurateLine**  You'd have to ask the user base because we treat this community like it belongs to them; not to us. We are simply here to facilitate their wishes.

#### /r/Terrorism


&nbsp;



I'm sure I don't need to say this, but today is an important day in the history of America and the world as a whole. Today marks the 17th anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Centers in New York, destroyed by plane highjackings from an Islamic terrorism group, Al Qaeda. Thousands were killed, thousands more were injured and countless lives were affected by this tragedy. It will be forever known as one of the darkest days in US history.



However, we do not wish to dwell on the attack at the moment; many other sources have done it better and more in-depth. We would like to talk about the source of the issue; terrorism. What can you do to stop terrorism? On an international or even national scale, very little. But what we as a people can do is not let it get to us. We will trust our governments and militaries to destroy the terrorist organisations at their core and bring peace to the world, but none of that matters if the terrorists can get to us in our hearts. Terrorism, as the term suggests, is used to inspire terror and fear. Fear can weaken a nation and cripple it. Fear brings about discord, which brings about polarisation, which brings about extremism. Fear isn't a military force, or a weapon of mass destruction. Fear is a much more subtle weapon. It brings about the thoughts and the mindsets that lead to war and rioting. That's what terrorism does. Terrorist attacks won't destroy a country to the point where it can't function, no, terrorism will cause the shift that causes the country to destroy itself. We can only indirectly control the governments that fix the issue, but we can directly control the extent that terrorism. We can't bring back the people who have had their lives taken by terrorism, but we can and will retain the spirit of the people.

Mystery Science Theater 3000, or MST3K as its often shortened, is a show with an extremely simple premise, watch a bad movie and make fun of it the whole time. It was started in 1988 by Joel Hodgson on a local Minnesota station called KTMA. It was then picked up by The Comedy Channel (later known as Comedy Central) in 1989 and then moved to  The Sci-Fi Channel in 1997 until its cancellation in 1999 after 197 experiments, 10 seasons and one feature length movie.

After some legal battles creator Joel Hodgson won back the rights to the show and in 2015 and started a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mst3k/bringbackmst3k) to bring the show back. It became the largest entertainment Kickstarter to today and got enough funding for 14 episodes. Finally in 2017 Mystery Science Theater 3000 returned on Netflix in 2017 for its 11th, the first new episodes in 18 years. Netflix renewed it for a 12th season that is expected to air within the next year.

The premise of the show is about some Mad Scientists send a man into outer space to watch bad movies on the Satellite of Love or the S.O.L. The Mad's want to drive him crazy for ""reasons"" unknown to us as an audience. Joel, the original host built robots or The 'Bots to help keep him sane. There are four 'Bots, Cambot, Gypsy, Tom Servo, and Crow. Tom Servo and Crow join him in the theater to make fun of the movie, Cambot records everything, while Gypsy takes care of the higher functions of the ship. 

Overtime they have changed hosts, Joel, Mike, and most recently Jonah. The Mad's have come and go, and the voices of the 'Bots have changed but at its core it has stayed the same, watch bad movies and mock them.

At the heart of this show is its fan base, the MSTies They have never stopped enjoying and supporting the show. Their philosophy being ""Keep Circulating the Tapes"". Fans would record the show on VHS tapes to rewatch them, then share them with fellow and new MSTies. This kept the show alive for many years. Even today not all of the experiments have been officially released on DVD, Blu-Ray or Digitally. The only known copies being ones that fans recorded when they aired on TV.

/r/MST3K is an amazing community for all MSTies to congregate, share their favorite jokes, experiments, and other related Mystery Science Theater 3000 content. Without communities like this, the show would likely not have returned. The fan base here is truly one of the most loyal in all of TV shows.

**Lets hear from the mods of /r/MST3k:**
&nbsp;
>**1. What's it like moderating /r/MST3K?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Fairly straightforward, MST3K already has a strong (and cool) community and brings that quality to the sub.

>>**/u/Difascio:** As this is my one and only place I moderate, I can't compare it to anything else but I've heard tales of others being super difficult (because of brigading, being a larger sub, etc.) to run. I think just the general aloofness of the MST fanbase makes it a lot easier, we just seem to all get along a lot more (even if we may not always see eye-to-eye on everything).

>**2. What are your favorite experiments?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Super tough question. I've always enjoyed Teenagers from Outer Space but the list of favorites is long.

>>**/u/Difascio:** Favorites is a very tough question, indeed. I'm a big fan of Hobgoblins, Warrior of the Lost World, and Danger!! Death Ray.

>**3. How long have you been a fan of the show, and who/what got you into it?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Since the mid-90s. It was on TV!

>>**/u/Difascio:** I've been a fan of the series since it started airing on the Sci-Fi channel (now known as SyFy). Not sure the first time I saw it. My mom and dad were divorced and when he would pick us up for his weekend we would always catch it on Sci-Fi and watch it together.

>**4. Which host and bot are your favorite?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Not sure I have a favorite host. Art has always been my favorite robot.

>>**/u/Difascio:** I don't have a favorite host per se, but 2 out of the 3 episodes I mentioned as favorites are Mike episodes so I guess...Mike? Though there are plenty Joel ones I enjoy as well, same with Jonah. Bot would be Crow.

>**5. What are your favorite running jokes?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Calling Crow Art, Hi-Keeba, Folgers Crystals.

>>**/u/Difascio:** ""Watch out for snakes!""

>**6. What are some of your favorite posts?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Users have made tons of great posts and I wish I could remember them all. Highlights include a link to the Russian fan homage ""Project Popcorn,"" and someone collecting all of the original ads to splice back into historic Turkey Days. Plenty of great creative efforts too. I wish I had an archive of ""Great Posts of /r/MST3K.""

>>**/u/Difascio:** I honestly couldn't name a favorite. The people involved in this community are so diverse and talented. There are so many I enjoy immensely.

>**7. What do you want to say to your current and future subscribers?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Enjoy the show and be excellent to each other.

>>**/u/Difascio:** Keep circulating the tapes.

>**8. Anything else you would like to add?**
>>**/u/microchannelplate:** Hi-Keeba.

>>**/u/Difascio:** Watch out for snakes!

/r/ComicBookArt is for the love of comic books; from the drawings, to the inking, to the lettering and panel layouts. Everything that makes us love the art form that is comic books.

Is it comic book related?
Is it art?
Is it art by a comic book artist?
Submit it! 

While there are a lot of tremendous art posted from official comic book artists, one of the best features about the sub that keeps bringing me back as often as I can is definitely the original art from the community. Its hard to not be blown away by the talent some people have, it really makes me want to pick up a pencil and give it a try. 

The post that made me first check out /r/ComicBookArt is a [Rorschach](https://i.redd.it/77nvxekl6ojz.jpg) drawing *(a character from Alan Moore's famous graphic novel Watchmen)* submitted by one of the members of the community named u/birdthirds. As someone who really appreciates art and the people who make it this was a sub I had to subscribe to and check out more. 



**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

>#Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**u/empathyx**  I took over the subreddit many years ago when it was inactive. I saw so many great art communities on Reddit that I also loved contributing to and I thought there could be a space for art related to and inspired by comic books. 

 
>##What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>>**u/empathyx**  I'm just overwhelmed by the original content that gets posted, it used to be few and far between and now a lot of people are posting their own works and there is so much talent and I just feel grateful to be a part of that.
There is just so much variety in the styles and posts
[Thanos](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookart/comments/8ece9s/the_best_drawing_ive_ever_done_thanos/), [Stained Glass Dr. Doom](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookart/comments/295wah/what_does_comicbookart_think_of_my_stained_glass/), [Someone's Desk](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookart/comments/4374kr/my_desk_from_1994/), Also [Spider-Nam](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookart/comments/8cs85x/spidernam_by_james_stokoe/) is one piece that gets posted often and I just think it's an interesting concept. 
 
>#What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/empathyx**  I've been lucky that this subreddit basically runs itself, great submitters and conversations. I plan to keep it as it has always been and hopefully the community continues to come back and grow even larger.
 

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/empathyx**  I would just add a big thank you to the community, everyone who posts, comments, upvotes this would just be me posting art I like without you all. Also thanks to everyone at /r/SubredditOfTheDay for this chance to get more people appreciating comic book art

The /r/ActionFigures subreddit is intended to be a mix of blogs, news articles, pictures, and discussions of action figures. We also welcome any toy related discussion.

They also have monthly themes, this months theme is [Hunter becomes The Hunted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActionFigures/comments/9c0bem/septembers_theme_of_the_month_hunter_becomes_the/) make sure to check that out its bound to be extremely interesting and segways nicely from last months theme which was [Highly unlikely crossovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActionFigures/comments/93wam0/augusts_theme_of_the_month_highly_unlikely/).

"September 7th, 2018 - /r/suspiciousquotes: ""Quotes"" Where They Shouldn't Be.",105,9dto5o,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/9dto5o/september_7th_2018_rsuspiciousquotes_quotes_where/,5,"####/r/suspiciousquotes

**56,760** suspects for **5 Years!**

/r/suspiciousquotes is a subreddit where quotes on signs are used to show ""emphasis"" instead of dialogue. To be ""frank"", when some quotes, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/suspiciousquotes/comments/7yepmi/now_im_uncomfortable/?utm_source=reddit-android) or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/suspiciousquotes/comments/7kf49c/this_has_to_be_a_classic/?utm_source=reddit-android) are interpreted with normal grammatic rules, they become extremely suspicious. They imply sarcasm or alternate meanings, which are not always straightforward (and are often malicious). This subreddit showcases the very best misused quotes, or rather, the most suspicious ones. 

In my opinion, the community is refreshing compared to other humor subreddits, because of the unique theme in the posts and the annoyed grammatical undertone. The subreddit is sure to get a good laugh out of you, or at the very least make you more ""careful"" about your use of quotes.

But who is behind the community? I did an interview with u/Searchlights, a mod, to learn more.



>#1. Why and when was this subreddit created?

>>**u/Searchlights**  Because it's always been a curiosity of mine, why people use quotation marks when they're unneeded or when they seem to imply sarcasm.

>##2. How would you describe the moderation of this sub? 

>>**u/Searchlights**  Tyranny of the Majority. It's straight up mob rule. If you like the content, you upvote it. If you don't like the content you downvote it. You do not need to message me to say things aren't funny or that you don't find them suspicious. Just vote!

>#3. What are some of your favourite quotes?

>>**u/Searchlights**  My favorites tend also to be the highest voted submittals: https://www.reddit.com/r/suspiciousquotes/top/

>#4. In your opinion, what makes a quote more “suspicious” than another?

>>**u/Searchlights** Personally, I enjoy when the addition of a quote calls the meaning of the word in to question and has the effect of implying something nefarious could be happening. When you refer to ""safety"", or that something is ""chicken"", I get worried.



Overall, the subreddit is worth a visit, and is definitely one of my ""favorites"". Next time you see a quote being used in a suspicious way, make sure to stop at /r/suspiciousquotes.

If you are like me and love Film and Art then I have the subreddit for you! /r/MoviePosterPorn is a safe for work image based sub dedicated to sharing movie posters. They have a format for their posts that keeps the sub neat and tidy and extremely pleasant to navigate. If you want to see a poster for one of your favorite films you are bound to find it on here.

I found the sub while browsing Reddit and saw this really sick movie poster for the movie [""*Predator""*](https://i.imgur.com/DwqMbPo.jpg). They have a great [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/wiki/index?v=adb1a576-5770-11e8-9857-0e77d0f2c6e0) where they describe Why some hosts allowed while others are not or if you post as well as helping you with various other questions.

Another fantastic feature is when you post a movie poster they have a bot called ""*u/MovieGuide""* that comments information about the movie posted  such as the title, synopsis, who the director and some of the actors are. It also shares the link for more information on the film at IMDb, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix, Wikidata..etc.  

**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

**1,515** *Bats* for **3 Months!**

/r/BatwomanTV is a subreddit dedicated to the newest CW TV show Batwoman. Batwoman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Katherine Kane is a wealthy heiress who becomes inspired by the superhero Batman and chooses, like him, to put her wealth and resources towards a campaign to fight crime as a masked vigilante in her home of Gotham City. Ruby Rose will make her debut as the character in the annual Arrowverse crossover this December 10th. 

The sub is 3 months old and already boasts an active community eager and excited to experience the newest addition to the DC TV roster. With her premiering in December this is one of the most exciting times to join us over at /r/BatwomanTV and experience the beginning of this journey. Just like on /r/FlashTV we plan on having episode discussion threads. I really can't wait to see everyone's reactions good or bad to her debut in the crossover. As a huge fan of Batman and his batfamily seeing the CW introduce one of them has been a really wonderful turn of events! 

**Even though we are still so young here are some of the best posts we have gotten so far!**

>#What made you want to moderate the sub?

>>**u/mitch06_11**  I wanted to moderate r/BatwomanTV because I have been enjoying the Arrowverse subreddits for quite a while now, and I wanted to help out a bit more around the community. So when the new Batwoman series was announced, I figured the best place to get started with helping out would be on a new sub. Luckily they let me help out, and it has been a really rewarding experience so far. It even opened up the door for me to become a moderator for another subreddit, r/LegendsOfTomorrow, which has also been a good experience so far.

 
>##What are your plans for the sub in the future? 

>>**u/mitch06_11**  At the moment I think our main plans for the sub are to gain some attention for Batwoman. We’re all hoping that it’ll have a big audience so that it gets picked up. When they start releasing more details and promotional material then we’ll probably update the CSS to include official images and other little details to make the sub feel more in line with the show.
 
>#What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/mitch06_11**  To all the present subscribers of r/BatwomanTV, thank you for subscribing. It’s a good sign that we have 1,500 subscribers to a sub dedicated for a show that hasn’t even started yet. Hopefully you’re all as hyped as I am for Batwoman to appear in the crossover and then in her own show! 

>>And to future subscribers, I guess you’re not subscribed now so I’m just gonna tell you to go do that. And also make sure you watch the Arrowverse crossover this year to see Batwoman’s debut!

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/mitch06_11**   If you haven’t already, check out the other Arrowverse shows! Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, and (my personal favourite) DC’s Legends of Tomorrow are all beginning their new seasons in October this year.

&nbsp;


Justice comes in many different shapes and sizes. Some, small things that don't matter too much. Some, large events that get news coverage and everything (see /r/JusticeServed for more like that). But the best type of justice, the most satisfying, is the type that you deal yourself. Welcome to /r/ProRevenge, the subreddit where you'll find the greatest, truly epic stories of taking the shit someone gave to OP, and OP giving it right back to them with a vengeance (that's quite literally what ""revenge"" means, after all).


There's 3 tiers of ""revenge"" subreddits; /r/PettyRevenge, /r/RegularRevenge, and /r/ProRevenge. The latter is only for the best if the best, the stuff that isn't just an excellent display of self-dealt justice, but a story, something that encapsulates the reader and keeps them going through. All of the posts on /r/ProRevenge are excellent; entertaining, funny, and satisfying as fuck. Due to the high standard of content, posts themselves can, admittedly, be rather scarce at times, but when a post is allowed up you can be sure it'll be a good one.


There's many excellent stories in this sub, and I can hardly talk about them all. This is one of those subs that you can spend hours just browsing the top posts of, and I've done it before. There are some true classics there, like [the time Apple got fucked in the small claims court for being pompous assholes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/8pocxv/apples_holierthanthou_attitude_is_their_undoing/), [the asshole manager who OP got fired via their own shady practices] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/7pr9wk/my_manager_was_an_awful_person_to_me_but_i_got/), and countless more. It'd be a sin for me to sit here and try and summarise them in a single sentence, the posts are long but I can't recommended enough that you read some of the top posts in the sub.

Overall, this subreddit is one of those ones that everyone should at least know about. Everyone loves a good revenge story, and there's nowhere that does them better than /r/ProRevenge.

**6,141** Subecribers for **9 years!**

&nbsp;

Do you love ordering things into orderly little charts? Are you obsessed with fictional characters? Do you like putting new twists on classic formulas? If you said yes to all of these of those, then you'd enjoy our little subreddit /r/alignmentcharts, a subreddit designed for making alignment charts of pretty much everything we can get our hands on. 

But first off, what is an alignment chart? The concept of alignments first came from character creation for DnD. Alignments are a result of the interaction of two categories: Predilection toward good/evil and predilection towards law/chaos. From the first we have good, which is altruistic and helps others, neutral, who are not really interested in helping and hurting people either way (although they certainly can), and evil, who are generally malevolent characters with no concern for the life of others. From the second, we have lawful, neutral, and chaotic. Lawful characters follow a strict code or the rules of a society, neutral characters will follow a rule if they have to or it benefits them, and chaotic characters will actively try to exist outside or break the rules of society. From the 3x3 combination of good, neutral, and evil, and lawful, chaotic, and neutral, we have an alignment chart with 9 categories. [This](https://i.redd.it/e7cadtmr9ta01.jpg) submission by /u/cslwoodward1 does a great job at explaining all nine of these alignments and what they are, and what type of characters you'd see in them. [Usually](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlignmentCharts/comments/8hxm97/my_first_attempt_an_alignment_of_trees/) but not always, alignment charts of fictional characters have character quotes in them that demonstrate their ethos and how they fit their alignment. 

This chart is simple, but it is extremely flexible, and can apply to literally any category of things under the sun. From [pizza](https://i.redd.it/euqbh2ugglm01.png) to [memes of frogs](https://i.redd.it/gc2nsqxe63101.png) to 
[the debate on the pronunciation of GIF](https://i.redd.it/fg0yq7tbca511.png) to [how people close their opened bread bags](https://imgur.com/I0fCW3x) to even  [the top posts on this subreddit](https://i.redd.it/83gzr3xw2q111.png), you can classify any set of things you want to with an alignment chart. But that's not all. After a while, classifying things according to law, chaos, good, and evil get boring, so that's where people start to use the alignment chart format while replacing good/evil and law/chaos with different things. For example, to align your college classmates you might replace good/evil with [4.0/average/failing](https://i.redd.it/ml0gbiffs7211.jpg), and for sandwiches you might use structure/ingredient purism to get your perspective on [what a sandwich really is](https://imgur.com/JdY1RyJ). We have a creative community of alignment chart makers here, and if you think you can make a good one, make sure to post it here and also to any community that might appreciate it also.

/r/IHadaStroke is a subreddit dedicated to nonsense comments/posts/reviews on YouTube, Facebook, Reddit etc, terrible text prints on t shirts, bags, stickers etc, and unintentional nonsense on websites, that everyone visiting can see. This subreddit is a place for humorous content that doesn't make much sense, therefore you believe you or the person that made the content, has had a stroke.

If you're looking for a wild experience this is the sub for you, you'd be surprised by the gibberish people have commented among the many different social media platforms. The sub is to celebrate people's mistakes and has had its fair share of original strokes commenting on posts showcasing them. All personal information is removed if a person is being attacked, to stop all witch hunts.

The content is always fresh since reposts are removed unless the original post is older than 6 months, in which case, most people haven't seen it.

The community is very friendly, welcoming and active. There has been multiple times people have mistaken the sub and posted about real strokes, and every time they have been given heartfelt and useful advice.


**Here are a few examples of what you might find on there during your visit:**

*  [leggings](https://www.reddit.com/r/ihadastroke/comments/8ae9e1/leggings/)

*  [One of the classics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ihadastroke/comments/8bamqx/one_of_the_classics/)

Binging with Babish is a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHA_jMfCvEnv-3kRjTCQXw) created by /u/OliverBabish in 2016. The channel got its popularity from taking food found in film and television and making it a reality. Breaking down the cooking process and ingredients into a well presented video that anyone can follow. Helping with its popularity /u/OliverBabish was also posting in /r/food some of the recipes and dishes he made, and before you knew it the channel was taking off. Now with over 3 million subscribers it has multiple uploads a week, featuring a new Basic's with Babish series to encourage viewers to try new techniques.

The community at /r/bingingwithbabish is full of posts from users sharing their attempts to make the recipes that have been featured. Just the other day I followed the recipe for [Cubanos from Chef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXYoduN0kWs). It was a good amount of work, but the end result was fantastic and it was part of my clean plate club. It also has a [Recipe Suggestion Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bingingwithbabish/comments/93jzeo/recipe_suggestion_megathread_for_august_2018/) where you can share your ideas on what you would like to see featured in a video.

No matter what kind of food you're into, this community and channel has nothing but quality content to provide. This is a true success story, starting off with a couple of posts on reddit and creating a huge YouTube channel because of it. Its great to see this community so involved and still moving things forward while celebrating what has been accomplished.

**Lets hear from the mods of /r/bingingwithbabish:**
&nbsp;
>**1. Whats it like moderating the subreddit?**
>>Fun and laid back for the most part. Folks here are usually looking to show off their BWB recreations, talk about the newest episode, request something for a future episode, or just chat about all things Babish.

>**2. What are some of your favorite dishes that have been featured?**
>>Most people's first go-to is the [Pasta Aglio e Olio inspired by Chef](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/5/4/aglioeolio) because the ingredients and the preparation are so simple and universal, just about anyone in the world could pick this up and make it.

>**3. Have you ever tried to make the dishes featured?**
>>I believe just about everyone on the mod team has tried at least one dish and have dreams of tackling some of the bigger challenges when able. The [Puerco Pibil](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/8/08/puerco-pibil), iirc, is one we all want to make.

>**4. What do you want to say to you current and future subscribers?**
>>Everybody loves a good story of recreation successes, failures, and tips for the future. Keep your eyes on the sub, because the man himself pops in from time to time with questions for us to help shape future episodes -- right this moment, he's put up a [Mini AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/bingingwithbabish/comments/97ag3z/mini_ama/), so we're looking forward to a response soon (no idea if it'll be here in the sub or a video).

>**5. Anything else you want to add?**
>>We're always looking for suggestions from the community to implement when able, a few examples are; We put up a poll to see what people's favorites were for the month, then change the banner and side bar images with the first and second place videos. Anyone who completes and posts up their recreation within 24 hours of a BWB or Basics video (but not the live stream) will earn a 24 Hour Club flair. And the most recent addition is a page listing all of [The Clean Plate Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/bingingwithbabish/wiki/cleanplateclub) recipes in one spot.

Though make sure to check the search bar to see if your question has been answered already. 

The mods on /r/Disneyland respect their users, and wish to provide a positive environment. They work hard to keep the quality of life on the sub representative of how Disneyland does at their park, a.k.a making it the happiest subreddit on Earth. 

They have also worked hard with the Disneylanders toput together a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/wiki/index) as well as a [cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18834IUa6xm0IVEZsVZsL2aO8OgnofK8l4WQlwkiGPFo/edit) to help with planning your trip to Disneyland. One of my favorite things about frequenting the sub is seeing the photos of the happy visitors and hearing about their trip.

Have you ever wanted to see a character from your favorite Movie or Television show drawn in a different style than you are used to? If so /r/alternativeart is the subreddit for you! /r/alternativeart  is an image based subreddit dedicated to showcasing art! 

""Alternative art, although I do not have a dictionary defined definition, is art that intends to reflect its original design/theme but different art techniques, themes, styles or other varying ""twists"" are added to make the art original and ""alternative"""" A good example would be an image of the South Park characters done anime style.

I first found the sub when I came across a photo of [Maui from 'Moana' as The Rock from the '90s](https://imgur.com/kdUynZ5), you know, that absurd photo with the fanny pack. It's hilarious. I have checked the sub almost daily since then. If you check the sub outI have no doubt that you will find at least one post every visit that you find amusing and enjoy!

>#What made you want to moderate the sub?

>>**u/jdwpom**  I didn't really get much say in the matter. my IRL buddy CATS whipped the place up and added me as a moderator. I'd introduced him to reddit a few months before, and for some reason he thought I had a clue how to make something of it. At the time, he was posting a bunch of this sort of material to /r/pics, but was finding it was getting removed for one reason or another, so he decided to whip up a subreddit for it. He'd then go in and promote the subreddit on any post that seemed semi-relevant to help grow it, and it just kind of came up from that.

 
>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/jdwpom**  I couldn't possibly pick. I'm yet to see a truly 'bad' post in here (even from content that I've had to remove), and love seeing these re-imaginings. 

 >#What is your favorite thing about moderating the sub?

>>**u/jdwpom**  I barely have to. The people here are fantastic - stuff that doesn't belong gets downvoted, stuff that's cool gets upvotes. It's exactly how a subreddit should be, where the moderator doesn't have to constantly step in, and the voters decide what they want to see. The most I've had to do in ages is remove the odd post that is the dictionary definition of 'alternative' art, rather than our own, and mark something NSFW. It's great. 

 

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/jdwpom**  Not much comes to mind. We're a proper self-managing subreddit, which is nice. I enjoy the content that comes through it, and it's nice to carry on something a friend started and enjoyed enough to try and spawn a community for.

**17,035** Rangers defending the galaxy for over **7 years**!

Today is a special day. One that almost every kid from the 90s fondly remembers. 25 glorious years ago, [Nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMK6FWN2-Ps), [Snoop Dogg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI3yXg-sX5c), & [Mariah Carey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IA3ZvCkRkQ) were blaring on the air waves unrelentlessly. In the heat of the summer there were water balloons & [Super Soaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/95qt8n/super_soaker_50/) fights on every street. Michael Jackson, the KING of Pop had recently gotten his first FALSE child sexual abuse allegation. Movie tickets were $4.25 and a gallon of gas cost $1.10. And there was no justified paranoia when kids would walk miles by themselves without adult supervision. Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers blasted through our Trinitrons on an unsuspecting generation of kids eating sugary cereals one fine saturday morning. And nothing was the same ever again.

I'm not going to reminiscence about Power Rangers themselves. I'm not going to take you down memory lane any further in this feature. I already did that (poorly) [6 years ago.](https://redd.it/vbjd4) No need to repeat the past. This time, I want to talk about the future. ~~Saban's~~ Hasbro's Power Rangers has been on the upswing for a good while now. Gaining more momentum with every day. There is even talks of a second Power Rangers movie. And the new series, [Power Rangers Beast Morphers](https://gizmodo.com/video/3556118?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=io9&jwsource=cl), is coming in 2019!

So what better time than now to subscribe to /r/PowerRangers?

>#1. Who is your favorite Ranger from all the seasons & why?

>>**/u/Gooflactus** Ziggy from RPM is still my favorite [character] story arc. With Ziggy, who starts out as a criminal then basically gets forced to take the RPM Green powers, then grows into them and proves himself as a Ranger.

>>**/u/Mikeyd2tall** Carter Grayson of Lightspeed Rescue. The guy stands for everything it means to be a Ranger. Courage, Teamwork, and helping people. Carter isn't the smartest guy in the world, but he knows who to defer to, and will if he has to. He knows every subject has its expert, and is humble enough to know he isn't the expert at everything. Also, **he drove a jeep right at a monster once.**

>>**/u/WhiteDragon9d** The Phantom Ranger would be my pick. Just because we never learned his identity so that mystery is there. I heard the producers intended him to be Billy Cranston the original Blue Ranger and I always hoped that was the case.

>>**/u/browniebiznatch** Green Ranger. He was the first ""special"" ranger that I was exposed to and as a 5 year old that was crazy dop.

>>**/u/LibraryDrone** Billy from MMPR. He was nerdy like me, and finding out later in life that David Yost is gay did a lot for my own self-esteem in finding myself.

>>**/u/zaahnjanson** Jason Lee Scott as Gold [Ranger]. I like the idea of Jason coming back, and not having the weight of leadership on his shoulders, and I like that in Zeo he was able to have a girlfriend and seemed like he had a social life.

>>**/u/RazgrizInfinity** I have two that are truly a tie My first favorite Ranger is Tommy when he was the White Ranger. The White Ranger holds a special place in my heart because I remember when I was a child, they promoted the 1995 movie by hosting at selected McDonalds the White Ranger doing Karate. Couple that with the Falconzord being my first true megazord that I got for Christmas, the White Light 3 part arc, White Ranger Tommy and Red Ranger Jason, and JDF being just awesome every time I have met him, the White Ranger for sure is my favorite.

>>My other favorite ranger is Karone. Behind Lord Zedd, I loved her as Astronema and her entire redemption arc that spanned into Lost Galaxy. She had a great story and was both great as a ranger and as a villain

>#2. What episode was way better than it ought to have been?

>>**/u/Mikeyd2tall** In Time Force there is an episode where Nadira falls for Lucas. This makes the main villain who hates ALL HUMANS, to treat lucas nicely and give him advice and protect him in the fights. It's adorable, it's ridiculous, it should not have worked in a million years.

>>**/u/browniebiznatch** The one where Tommy came back as Green Ranger to get the power coins and his power keeps going in and out.

>>**/u/LordCheezus** Graduation Blues from Zeo. With all the silliness with Bulk, Skull, Goldar and Rito Revolto during the episode, having the powerful moment of Billy's goodbye and passing of his Ranger powers was done way better than it ever should have been.

>>**/u/LibraryDrone** A Date With Danger. It should have been 100% bad, but the episode was sweet with the whole Zhane/Astronema date thing.

>>**/u/zaahnjanson** Power Rangers In Space: Countdown to Destruction Parts 1 & 2. Holy crap, the rangers revealed themselves, full-scale invasion, tying up all the loose ends, Rita and Zedd! I loved that they showed the non-earth based teams fighting, it made it feel like, “this is it”.

>#3. Whats your personal favorite merchandise?

>>**/u/Gooflactus** I have the Soul of Chogokin [Megazord](http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Megazord) and I'll soon have the SoC Dragonzord with Titanus preordered. This means I'll have a massive diecast metal Ultrazord. I also have the Power Coins from all of Mighty Morphin which I like to display.

>>**/u/WhiteDragon9d** I have a lot of Green Ranger Merch and I love the legacy [Dragonzord](http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonzord) figure.

>>**/u/Mikeyd2tall** [The Supertrain Megazord from Lightspeed Rescue.](http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Supertrain_Megazord) It's huge, it's chunky, and it's fun as hell to put together.

>>**/u/LordCheezus** My signed by Jason David Frank and sealed Flip Morph Green Ranger figure.

>>**/u/LibraryDrone**  [Auric the Conqueror from Power Rangers Zeo.](http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Auric_the_Conqueror) You insert his golden key into his chest, and the toy pops open to reveal this idol is actually a zord.

>>**/u/zaahnjanson** I’d have to say my Deluxe 2010 Dino Megazord. I always wanted one as a kid and my parents were never able to afford it, and when I was able to buy one myself as an adult, it literally brought a tear to my eye, and 8-year-old ZaahnJanson jumped for joy. I shamelessly played with it for a couple of hours.

>>**/u/RazgrizInfinity** Legacy Morphers. I am a frequent convention goer so whenever a former Ranger is there, I always take my morpher to get a morphing photo op with them or to morph with them on video. I have met all of the OG crew minus David Yost and Catherine.

>#4. Are you into the new comics? Are they cannon? What is your favorite comic moment?

>>**/u/Gooflactus** The comics are amazing, but I don't think they are in cannon to the show. Just from the fact that they have cellphones in the issue 0 means to me that this is a more modern timeline. As far as favorite moments go, it may be out of the norm one of my favorites is when [**SPOILER**](#s ""Tommy is murdered during the start of the Shattered Grid event""). Not that I wanted that to happen, but just the fact that they did it threw out ALL of my expectations of this event, leading me to enjoy it way more.

>>**/u/WhiteDragon9d** When Bulk has the coming together with Kimberly. It was very sweet to see.

>>**/u/Mikeyd2tall** When Billy and Trini are working on the Dragonzord, in the lake, and it reveals that through a zoom-out panel shot. It was gorgeous, it was the first evidence to me that this comic was super special.

>>**/u/browniebiznatch** The Drakkon reveal. Epic.

>>**/u/LordCheezus** Boom Studios are doing incredible work with the comics. I think of the comics as an alternative universe. The Ranger Slayer vowing to kill Lord Drakkon.

>>**/u/LibraryDrone** I am extremely into the comics. The moment from Shattered Grid when we get that 2-page spread of their reinforcements arriving at the Command Center made me cry... **a lot.**

>>**/u/zaahnjanson** LOVE THE COMICS! Holy cow, I would love it if the writing team from the comics was able to write a season of the show.

>#5. What is your cheesy one liner from the show?

>>**/u/Gooflactus** & **/u/LibraryDrone** in unison... ""Morphinominal!""

>>**/u/browniebiznatch** ""It's Morphin' Time!""

>>**/u/LordCheezus** While not from the show, I always found the scene from the first movie, where Ivan Ooze spits like 30ft away from his seat to create the Tengu warriors and Mordant just says “Good Distance.” A very dumb line but super funny delivery.

>>**/u/zaahnjanson** From the 1995 Movie, “You ooze you lose!”

>>**/u/Mikeyd2tall** ""Sometimes when I Morph...there's this giant....well...I couldn't help but notice a giant explosion behind me.""

##Final word

As you can tell from this Q&A portion how passionate the mods are. I have to be honest, the mods were so eager to share their stories I had to remove 2 entire questions worth of answers cause this article would never end if I added them. And I had to heavily shorten a lot of answers that I did end up putting in the article. With this feature I wanted to give you a taste of their love for all things Power Rangers. Hopefully you'll subscribe to /r/PowerRangers and share your stories past and present with them as well.

**18,787** *readers* for **9 Years!**


/r/Superman is dedicated to the first major superhero Superman in all his many forms: comics, TV, cartoons, film, and merchandise. You can also expect to see some wonderful art made by fans and members of the community!

The mods work hard to keep the community active there is a weekly thread called ""The (Not So) Daily Planet!"" where they discuss the weeks comics, Tv and Film. As someone that can't always keep up with the weeks newist  issues its really cool to be able to read this thread and get a feel for it so I can check it out at a later date. They also showcase a weekly rewatch thread for Superman: The Animated Series where a dedicated user posts the synopsis as well some other pertinent information.

Its always a pleasant time visiting /r/Superman, the sub the community is really open to new users and from my experience just want to help if someone has something they would like to know about the character. As a huge fan of the films I always check the sub to see if there is any news on the Man of Steel sequel, no luck yet but when there is news I can guarantee they'll have it as soon as it breaks!


**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

*  [What's the ""S"" stand for? (r/funny) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hrf22/whats_the_s_stand_for_rfunny/)


*  [Saw this and had to share](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/8ipkqs/saw_this_and_had_to_share/)

*  [BvS/MoS Side by Side Comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/3czud1/bvsmos_side_by_side_comparison/)


*  [An amazing quote from Christopher Reeve. The impact of Superman over the last 80 years on pop culture goes deep](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/8bm01j/an_amazing_quote_from_christopher_reeve_the/)


*  [Check out my Superman tattoo! It’s about a year old in this photo.](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/8rnpey/check_out_my_superman_tattoo_its_about_a_year_old/)



>#What is your favorite thing about Superman?  

>>**u/MajorParadox**  I love how he's someone who not only saves people but works as an example to strive for. A message that he tends to get across is ""powers or not, everyone is a superhero if they do what they can to help.""

>>**u/jmoriarty**  His humanity. With his powers he could take over, become a tyrant, get whatever he wanted... but he won't. His sense of morality and compassion are too strong, and he holds himself to the highest of standards. That in turn makes him an inspiration for both other heroes and regular people.

>>**u/ZacPensol**  He embodies a hopeful escapist fantasy that I think we can all benefit from in life. The idea that this nearly all-powerful guy would choose to use his abilities for the good of mankind rather than personal gain is particularly inspirational to me, both in how I conduct myself and in how I try to see the world.

>##Why did you start/join the subreddit?  

>>**u/MajorParadox**  I noticed the mod team was looking into redesigning the CSS, so I offered my help since I've had experience with that. They ended up adding me to help the transition and now I just help out as a full mod :)

>>**u/jmoriarty**  I love Superman stories, but also how other people react to him. And of course I love find out about cool Supes swag. It's a good place to talk about the character with other people who are as passionate about him as I am.

>>**u/ZacPensol**  I first started coming around pretty much as soon as I joined Reddit because I love Superman, though that was right around when 'Man of Steel' came out and the comics' New 52 relaunch was in full swing (neither of which did I particularly care for) and so I didn't participate in conversation a whole lot. Eventually though it started making for interesting discussions with people of different opinions. When applications opened up for new mods I threw in my hat because I'd come to really enjoy the friendly community and wanted to do what I could to help maintain and strengthen it.

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/MajorParadox**  I write Superman over on r/DCFU so check it out and let me know what you think!

>>**u/jmoriarty**  Once upon a time Superman wasn't the dark, gritty character we've seen in movies, but a source of inspiration. He's someone to look up to not because he is a ""boy scout"", but because he challenges us to be better and believes in us to achieve it. I'm hoping that once again we reach a point where that's the sort of hero we really need.

**19,583** *readers* for **8 Years!**

Now that pretty much everyone has a digital camera in their pocket, more people have the opportunity to take wonderful pictures with an ease and convenience that was unheard of before smartphones became so accessible. /r/iPhoneography is an image based subreddit dedicated to all iPhone photography, news, tips, and discussions. 

If you are a beginner or a long time photographer this is the sub for you, if you have any questions the community is pretty welcoming and will try to answer your question to the best of their abilities. Make sure to check out their Top Photo Fridays every week at 9am ET, they're also running a photo contest which ends on the 25th so look out for the results. This week's theme is Transportation. 

I have found that every time I visit /r/iPhoneography I am blown away by the photos that are posted on their. I've added quite of  locations to my bucket list after seeing such exquisite photographs. It has also inspired me to try to be more artistic and take more photos while I am out and about. Hope it inspires you as well! 

**A photo is worth a thousand words. So here are some the best posts submitted over on** /r/iPhoneography:


*  [Iphone X at sunrise](https://i.imgur.com/tAWsOzb.jpg)

*  [Tough to complain. iPhone X.](https://i.imgur.com/ZlhXoXe.jpg)

*  [My first shot with the iPhone X! (coming from Pixel and I'm impressed!)](https://i.imgur.com/OZJejLJ.jpg)

*  [I just upgraded to the X and took this pic of my dog at sunset. I’m blown away by portrait mode](https://i.redd.it/cnjjrismx9z01.jpg)

*  [Sunset. iPhone X.](https://i.imgur.com/1HbFltL.jpg~~~~)

*  [iPhone X portrait mode.](https://i.imgur.com/yRGLtaZ.jpg)







>#What made you want to moderate the sub? 

>>**u/a_knife**  What really made me want to moderate /r/iPhoneography was that about 3 years ago I started taking photos with my iPhone and ever since then I’ve been searching for a community of like minded mobile photographers. I eventually moved on to more professional photography equipment, but nothing will be able to match what you can capture (quickly) on your phone at a random point of your day. 

 

>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub? 

>>**u/a_knife**  It’s hard to point to an exact favorite. But I can say that I get the most enjoyment out of the ones that show the most passion and enthusiasm in their mobile photography journey. 

>##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**u/a_knife**  The plans consist of being a valuable resource in the mobile photography community, and for like minded people to share their own glimpses of the world around them.

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/a_knife**  I don’t think iPhones are exclusive to mobile photography. Each device has its own strength, and weakness. I just happen to prefer Apple devices over the alternatives. So I would hope the community doesn’t out grow the current friendliness that it offers today. Also, thank you for taking your time to feature the sub!

**56,430** *Metalcore Fans* for **8 Years!**


The /r/Metalcore subreddit is dedicated to news, reviews, videos and discussion of Metalcore bands. If you don't know what Metalcore is it's a blending of metallic guitar, drumming, and throatier vocals with the frenetic and compact hardcore punk song structure. 

Bolstered by its dedicated moderates and passionate community if you're interesting in checking out this genre of music or are a long time listener this is the subreddit for you. You'll find the users there are more than welcoming to new listeners and people who want to know more. Recently one of my favorite bands came back after years of hiatus, I wouldn't have known unless I was subscribed to this sub.

They have a number of weekly and monthly scheduled threads. Every Monday they have a recommendation thread where you can leave a comment asking for recommendations, its a great way to discover new music and talk to people about bands you enjoy. There is also a monthly General Discussion thread, Free-Talk thread, and a Check out my band thread. Over all it is a really well rounded subreddit that is more than worth your click!


**Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:**

*  [Tear this place up!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/5xmbhp/tear_this_place_up/)

*  [Architects guitarist Tom Searle has lost his battle with cancer :( RIP you bloody legend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/4yucyx/architects_guitarist_tom_searle_has_lost_his/)

*  [August Burns Red - Invisible Enemy (Official Music Video) NEW SHIT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/6pxc7r/august_burns_red_invisible_enemy_official_music/)

*  [As I Lay Dying - My Own Grave (Official Music Video) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/8pfeah/as_i_lay_dying_my_own_grave_official_music_video/)

*  [Linkin Park Frontman Chester Bennington Found Dead at 41 :(](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/6oi8fx/linkin_park_frontman_chester_bennington_found/)

*  [Is it possible to dual-wield spells?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/290hin/is_it_possible_to_dualwield_spells/)



>#What's your favorite thing about the community on /r/Metalcore?  


>>**u/lazenbooby**  I love that we have a civil, friendly community that is happy to help others find new music as well as sharing their passion for their favourite bands. Defining genres can often lead to a lot of arguing but our subreddit seems more than happy to discuss in a civil manner which is a very refreshing, positive thing to see.

>>**u/daddy_fiasco**  How open and welcoming we are. Our users look out for each other. We get posts fairly regularly about how our subreddit and the music we all love has helped them through tough times, and how much we've helped them. They know how to disagree with each other civilly, without name calling and personal attacks.
I love how we are able to get the artists we love to come to the sub for AMAs, and how we have band members who are regular users

>##What was the band that got you into metalcore?



>>**u/lazenbooby**  I started getting more into Post-Hardcore bands such as Enter Shikari, before eventually finding bands like Parkway Drive, The Devil Wears Prada etc which opened up a wide range of new bands for me to discover.

>>**u/daddy_fiasco**  It was Zao, specifically the ""greatest hits"" album 'Legendary' followed shortly by their album The Funeral of God, and All That Remains- The Fall of Ideals. Oh I forgot, Avenged Sevenfold - Waking the Fallen was at the same time as Zao. 

>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?


>>**u/lazenbooby**  My personal favourite is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/290hin/is_it_possible_to_dualwield_spells/) where a user asked a question in the wrong subreddit and the community responded with great humour and jokes about Metalcore bands/songs.

>>**u/daddy_fiasco**  Probably all the AMAs I get for us(humblebrag) But otherwise, it's all the posts about how much the community cares for one another.

**11,482** sticky rectums for **23** days!

/r/RectalStickers! A place to showcase the art that is For Rectal Use Only stickers.

Finally, a subreddit everyone can get behind! A little hole on Reddit where we like to allocate the hilarious medical ""For Rectal Use Only"" stickers onto inappropriate places throughout the world. We know it's immature, butt we embrace it. Don't be bummed if you have seen this before, just embrace your inner child like the rest of us! This is the concentrated goodness that might just tickle your pickle. We have a sticky up on where to find these little tokens of pleasure (https://www.reddit.com/r/RectalStickers/comments/92jv8f/where_to_buy_for_rectal_use_only_stickers/), but the phenomena actually created a bit of a shortage when it first took off and got gassed up.

The post that started it all was https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/92ime7/i_bought_a_roll_of_these_day_1_of_500/ on /r/funny, and the maiden voyage of this roll of stickers was a nice girthy cucumber. We were asstounded at the feedback.

Every day someone, somewhere, will be dictating the use of a random object for the world to see. 
Here's where someone (me) infiltrated the grocery store:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RectalStickers/comments/92xmbc/day_3_i_have_infiltrated_the_grocery_store/

A nice booty fountain:

For when you're a lil leaky:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RectalStickers/comments/92p05h/it_only_seemed_appropriate/

Most likely not it's intended application, but we don't let these rules define us in the end. So, come on over, grab yourself a roll, and make the world a butter place!

There isn't more to it than that, and if I get anymore cheeky, I might make an ass of myself.

Rectum.

My favourite part of the subreddit is that not only do you get to see amazing art (such as [this breathtaking painting](https://i.redd.it/hfhbjb1pigo01.jpg) with soft pastels by /u/ekgreen and [this beautiful charcoal portrait](https://i.redd.it/4hwklz71jod11.jpg) by /u/GlNKO), but you get to read detailed and incredibly useful feedback.  
  
Overall, with art which can be better and more thought provoking than /r/art or /r/painting, and a welcoming and very talented community, /r/ArtCrit is a subreddit which you should definitely check out.

**25,486** numismatists for **10 years!**

Money is such an intregal part of our everyday life. You use money to pay for goods, you recieve money as payment for services. With money, you can buy a house, plane, car, phone, or even just a stick of gum! Coins, a kind of money, have been around for thousands of years. But most people don't know about coins except for little George, Abe, Thomas, and Franklin. People who collect these older, rarer, and more out-of-the-ordinary coins are called *numismatists*. But you don't have to be a numismatist to learn about the unique and rich history of coinage. That's what r/Coins is for.

r/Coins is a subreddit that I have been subscribed to for over a year now, and it never fails to please.  With just over 25,000 subscribers, you always see a sense of friendliness towards others and willingness to help. The moderators are always willing to listen to your feedback about subreddit things and do their job very well. r/Coins, by far, is a great example of what a model subreddit should look like.

When I first subscribed to r/Coins, the one thing that really stood out to me was the quality of content. r/Coins users never spam and are always posting great content related to coins and coin collecting. The rules for this content are broad enough that r/Coins can welcome all types of users, whether they are advanced collectors, novice collectors, or just people wanting to learn about coins! The moderatores never fail to please the community. You always see a moderator commenting on posts, or creating posts themselves ([here's a great example!](https://redd.it/97fqqh)). With giveaways, megathreads, and more; you can always come to this subreddit and know you're going to get some nice content.

Here's some links for you all to see:

* [""A literal pile of large 1 cent coins from the great grandparents. Time to get sorting!""](https://redd.it/92qx4m)
* [""In my change today""](https://redd.it/6vlcro)
* [""Funny letter found with family's old coins""](https://redd.it/994phf) -  *a little bit of humor for the funny people, ;)*
* *There's plenty of others you'll just have to check out yourself!*

"August 21st, 2018 - /r/Yiff: [NSFW] It's only strange if you make it so.",258,992l2m,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/992l2m/august_21st_2018_ryiff_nsfw_its_only_strange_if/,304,"*(Warning: The following subreddit is NSFW. If you do not enjoy this type of content, run away from this post and never return.)*   
####/r/Yiff  
  
**65,210** furries *yiffing* for  **8 years!**  
  
All the old Internet saying Rule 34 asserts, ""if something exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."" Both increasing the validity of this adage and decreasing my mental stability, I have not found a notable exception to this rule. *Yet.* This rule applies especially to fandoms such as, yes, the furry fandom.   
  
Yiff, as described at its simplest, is pornography starring anthropomorphic animal characters (furries). By the nature of the *animal* aspect, the topic is highly controversial. Is the porn just for the anthropomorphic features (not crossing over into wanting to have sex with an actual dog/femboi fox), or is it a way for perverted people to get off to bestiality without being in legal trouble? To find some real opinions from real people, we need to turn to the best place to find highly polarizing and oversimplified opinions, the Reddit comment section sorted by controversial.  
  
""Yiff is not really that weird. Non-pornographic artwork and animations have used such animal-human hybrid characters for years. So if drawn/animated content containing anthropomorphic animals isn't weird, and drawn/animated pornographic material isn't weird, why is it suddenly weird when you combine the two?""  
  
""I think it's [weird] because it seems to be an obvious substitution for bestiality. Can't watch the real thing because it's illegal? Try this instead!""  
  
""seriously? I'm actually into this shit and I find this super distasteful for SORTD. Lost all my respect.""  
  
Here to give more insight into the weird and wonderful world of furry porn are /u/evilsibe (founder of /r/yiff), and the (in)famous furry attention whore /u/FurryPornAccount.  
  
>##1. How did you get involved in this subreddit?   

>>**/u/FurryPornAccount**  I got involved in /r/yiff because I needed a place to post yiff so I could live up to my username, and /r/yiff is a convenient place to post it. Getting karma for posting yiff is also pretty nice too.

>>**/u/evilsibe**  I started the subreddit 8 years ago. There was a r/furry subreddit but no r/yiff.  

>##2. Why do you think that the furry community and yiff have a stigma surrounding them?  

>>**/u/FurryPornAccount**  I honestly believe it's because it's just taboo to be into anthropomorphic animals. That and the 'vocal minority' who do actually do reprehensible things don't help with the public opinion of furries.

>>**/u/evilsibe**  I think anything sexual that folks outside of the subculture don't understand will end up having a stigma attached to it.  

>##3. Are there any significant artists who should be checked out?  

>>**/u/FurryPornAccount**  Marblesoda, zeta-haru, raiji and fluff-kevlar are some pretty good artists.

>>**/u/evilsibe**  I actually really like a non-yiff artist [ritwells](https://www.deviantart.com/ritwells).  

>##4. Anything else you would like to add?  

>>**/u/FurryPornAccount**  introduce me as ""furry attention whore /u/FurryPornAccount"" thank

>>**/u/evilsibe**  I would like to add that YES YOU CAN BE A FURRY TOO JOIN US!

*Subreddit dos maconheiros, homossexuais, comunistas, beneficiários do Bolsa Família e universitários. Esquerdistas em geral.*

Subreddit of the potheads, homosexuals, communists, welfare queens, and college students. Leftists in general.

This ambiguous tone is how Brasil do B presents itself to new users. It is a subreddit for leftist Brazilians to gather and share news and opinions about politics, current matters, and also to chat about daily life because we're all human.

The name of the community comes from a tradition of Brazilian online communities of adding ""do B"" (""do Brasil"", of Brazil in English) when they split, which, itself, comes from leftist political parties that keep the acronym of the party they split from somewhat intact and add this ending, such as PCdoB and PTdoB.

*Links in Portuguese below are marked as [PT].*

**Why do we need a leftist subreddit? Isn't isolation bad?**

Dialog is important to spread your ideas, but you need reflection to improve them. In general communities, you will find too many people who ""hate"" whatever they know as ""left"", people who actually hate the left, and the ones who just ignore what it stands for. It is too tiresome to talk only with people who know your ideas and principles only from a distance, and even more when there is an ocean of misinformation and fake news around you.

This is where a community with undilluted leftist opinions helps. It serves not only the insiders, but also the curious and the uninitiated, who can actually get to know what we actually think.

**What are the hot themes right now in Brazil?**

2018 is election year, this should be enough said, but it isn't. The #1 candidate in polls is Lula da Silva, former social-democratic president, who, as of August 2018, has 29% of votes. Unfortunately, he was arrested in the beginning of the year on a controversial trial that charged him of corruption.

The second place in polls is [Jair Bolsonaro](https://youtu.be/9TiqyO5JQZs?t=6m45s) (subtitles in English) a member of the military who defends the military dictatorship (1964-1985) and [openly praises the torture commited in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54KUDU-u1P0) [PT]. 

Similarly of what you can see in the USA and Europe, ideological polarization is happening in Brazil. The president elected in 2016, Dilma Rousseff, from the same political party of Lula, was ousted through an impeachment process that many people consider a coup. Her political opponents never accepted her electoral victory. The other candidate in the second turn called for protests against her, the hostile conservative congress came up with [""pautas-bomba"" (""bomb rulings"")](http://www.ebc.com.br/noticias/politica/2015/08/entenda-o-que-sao-chamadas-pautas-bombas-que-podem-ser-votadas-pelo) [PT] the would make government spending go through the roof, in order to corrode her administration, as if the other concessions her reformist party had already made weren't enough to make her unpopular even to the people who voted for her.

[Here is a summary of the impeachment process in English by The Young Turks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ2cOLXByq8)

Now, we are being governed by the backstabbing vice president who is far more implicated in corruption and whose administration [is considered bad or terrible by more than 70% of people](http://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2018/04/ibope-divulga-nova-pesquisa-sobre-popularidade-de-michel-temer.html) [PT].

**I am not a leftist, can I post there?**

We welcome anyone who can offer good insight and valid criticism. However, we have a defined theme and public, and we want to keep it that way. We will take measures to assure the majority of comments and posts are from leftist perspectives and will take down trolls on sight.

Technology is fucking everywhere. In our homes, in our transport, in our pockets, sometimes in our very bodies. And when you have all this extremely complicated stuff that keeps our society from crumbling, it's honestly astounding how rare the larger glitches occur. With all the computers and software running in the world, you'd expect to have hundreds of massive errors around the globe every day. But amazingly, for the most part, the shit just works. We tricked a rock into thinking using magic lighting, and then we managed to make it so stable that it could get *almost* everything perfect.



Emphasis on *almost*. Because as well designed as these things are, there are still errors of all shapes and sizes. I'm sure many of you are aware of r/softwaregore, the large subreddit made for massive glitches in software. As good as the sub is, today we're going to focus on the smaller errors, ones that just cause a little glitch. We'll be discussing /r/TechNope today.



/r/TechNope is a subreddit that highlights all sorts of software and technology errors. These errors don't have to be particularly large, but they are always rather funny to laugh at. Whether it's a [badly designed bit of code] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TechNope/comments/984hju/mp3_player_doesnt_support_mp3_files/), [AI fucking up] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TechNope/comments/94pnc8/you_are_20_years_old/), [AI apparently developing sentience] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TechNope/comments/943w2k/siris_sudo_command/), or [] () ^(yeah, AI isn't exactly perfect yet, is it) , all the posts here are varied and entertaining. If you like r/softwaregore, but are tried of the repetitive ""oh no Google displayed the wrong image on a Wikipedia article the entire site is ruined"" posts, r/TechNope is the perfect sub for you.

/r/gentlemanboners is an image based subreddit dedicated to showcasing female celebrities in formal attire. Despite the ""boner"" in the title it is an  is a PG-13, SFW sub that priorities showing the dress rather than skin. You will find that the sub is filled to the brim with stars of movies, television, models, comedians, and sometimes athletes as well. 

The mods of /r/gentlemanboners have made it a priority to make sure the posts and comments on the sub stay classy and that the quality of the photos is high. They make sure low quality photos and vulgar comments are removed as quickly as possible. While most of the comments are about the appearance of the women submitted some of the best discussions happen when the topic turns to her body of work. I often end up finding some great films or TV shows to check out while reading through the comments of some of the actresses posted. 

Of course, you're not here just for me to explain how the sub works. You're here to see photos of beautiful women. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words. So here are some the best posts submitted over the last few years.

**50,860** sorcerers *necromancing* for  **2 Years!**  
   
/r/ComedyCemetery is a place for failed attempts at humour, where over 345,000 *resigned teachers* joke about the jokes which have gone there to die. /r/ComedyNecromancy, on the other hand, is where users believe these jokes can be improved, and jokes from the cemetery come back to life. The strong theme on the subreddit is that ""less is more"" and that comic artists *(something something Adam Ellis)* should know when to **stop** telling their jokes. Overall, the subreddit has racked up over 50,000 subscribers in just 2 years.  
  
>##1. Why did you join the subreddit?   

>>**/u/salty_casimir**  I'm the original creator of the subreddit. My old account just got suspended because reasons. I created it because people were posting things on r/comedycemetery, then in the comments someone would post an edit to the comic/joke/whatever to make it funny again, and people would say ""r/comedynecromancy"" even though it didn't exist yet - so I created it and now here we are.  

>##2. What's moderating the sub like?  

>>**/u/salty_casimir**  Moderating the sub is pretty easy, usually. Automoderator reminds everyone to post originals so that's usually pretty well taken care of, sometimes people think deepfrying/bhj/surrealism are necromancy, but they aren't, so we remind people to put those in their respective subs or whatever.  

>##3. What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?  

>>**/u/salty_casimir**  I love all the posts that are improved Adam Ellis comics. They're a classic of the sub, and one of the reasons the sub exists in the first place. There are lots that are really well done and I love them.  
  
*****
  
My personal favourite submissions are those who take the liberty to completely rework the comic. For an example, [this](https://i.redd.it/zy4936ezkte01.jpg) is the original /r/4panelcringe material from /r/ComedyCemetery, which was actually completely redrawn in [this](https://i.redd.it/n2rf8dopa7h01.png) submission by /u/Teh-Piper. Also, like /u/salty_casimir, the improved Adam Ellis comics have a special place in my heart.   

To get an idea of the sub at its best, these are the top three posts of all time:  
  
1. [What is something you wish you had?](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedynecromancy/comments/7bf8d0/what_is_something_you_wish_you_had/)  
2. [Know when to stop telling a joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedynecromancy/comments/71a32d/know_when_to_stop_telling_a_joke/)  
3. [I tried to make the joke more concise](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedynecromancy/comments/6gspw8/i_tried_to_make_the_joke_more_concise/)

Every time I visit /r/DisneyVacation I spend at least 5-10 minutes scrolling through amazing posts and laugh until I'm red in the face.

/r/DisneyVacation takes images from WikiHow articles out of context and adds hilarious captions to them. For those of you unfamiliar with [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page) it is a website where you can go to learn to do about anything you want. It is all community run and open source, any one can contribute. It features text and images to give you a step-by-step process on what to do and expect. Its from those images that the content of this subreddit comes from.

The inspiration and name from the subreddit came from a [/r/CrappyDesign post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/4ebt9v/just_another_wikihow_illustration/d1zh7yh/?context=2) submited two years ago. The [original WikiHow article](https://www.wikihow.com/Plan-a-Disney-Vacation) has since been updated with new images and content, but the meme lives on!

Lets here from the mods of /r/DisneyVacation!
&nbsp;
>**1. Whats it like moderating the subreddit?**

>>**/u/Improbably_wrong** - Moderating this sub isn’t too difficult or time consuming. This community tends to be pretty tame and u/WikiHowLinkBot helps us make sure all posts comply with our rules. The automod filter is also very helpful for moderating purposes.

>>**/u/Xalaxis** - Moderating the subreddit is generally very quiet, but when there is an argument things can heat up fast. This doesn't happen often however, and I imagine it's a situation similar on all popular subreddits. The development of /u/WikiHowLinkBot with /u/Improbably_Wrong 's help has cut our moderation demand by at least 80%.

>**2. What are some of your favorite posts?**

>>**/u/Improbably_wrong** - I’d have to say these two really made me laugh:

>>https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/comments/86l0nt/how_to_make_use_of_your_paralyzed_son_when_you/

>>https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/comments/94vxl6/how_to_shame_your_teenage_son_about_his_excessive/

>>But to generalize your question, captions that use very clever wit to mock the images are always the best ones.

>>**/u/Xalaxis** - Some of my personal favorites are: https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/comments/76xv0p/how_to_publicly_shame_a_furry/ https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/comments/8ravaq/how_to_get_overwhelmed_as_a_woman_on_tinder/ and of course https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/comments/8hf1i9/how_to_misunderstand_the_point_of_this_subreddit/

>**3. What do you want to say to your current and future subscribers?**

>>**/u/Improbably_wrong** - I’d like to say thank you for making the r/disneyvacation what it is today. Personally I joined this r/disneyvacation when it had 100k subscribers and watching it grow so fast was incredible! Its growth would not be possible without the community sifting through a bunch of Wikihow articles and coming up with clever image captions. (P.S. we have a “Random Wikihow article” button in the redesign of our subreddit.)

>>**/u/Xalaxis** - Be bold. Some of our best posts have come from users who thought their idea was stupid. You'll never know if you don't try, and WikiHow has some of the most ridiculous illustrations being drawn every single day!

>**4. Anything else you would like to add?**

>>**/u/Xalaxis** - I honestly, truly, never expected the subreddit to grow from the few-hundred subscribers it was when I took it over from /u/DaemonXI to the hundreds of thousands we have now. Hopefully that means we've been doing something right :)

**117,146**  *Speedsters* for  **4 Years!**  


The r/FlashTV subreddit is dedicated to the American superhero television series airing on The CW. It is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to move at superhuman speeds. Like with all comic book adaptations the fans are extremely passionate about their favorite hero. That passion is what makes this subreddit worth your time.


As a huge DC fan when I heard there was going to be a TV show about the Flash I was thrilled. So when I eventually started using Reddit I was very happy to find that the community was extremely welcoming and fun to be a part of. It's put a smile on my face pretty much every time I'm on the sub. 

The sub has many great features but hands down the best posts have to be the shitposts. Everyday there seems to be a brand new one that surprises the hell out of me and makes me laugh. If Shitposts aren't your cup of tea then you'll enjoy catching up on the latest episode discussions. Seeing everyone's reactions good or bad is something I look forward to every week the show is on. Whether its a shit post, discussion, theory, fan creation, multiverse..etc there is never a dull day on this sub.

 
**Here's a glimpse of some of the posts you'll find on r/FlashTV**:

>#1. What motivated you create/moderate this sub?

>>**u/Airsay58259**  I was asked to join the moderation team after one of the mod noticed me being often online and helping users / calling out reposts and stuff like that (nerd alert, I know). I didn't have any mod experience but I loved the show and community so I thought ""eh, why not?"". Besides there weren't many active mods back then so it was an opportunity to help. 

>##What's moderating the sub like? 

>>**u/Airsay58259**  It's not always easy but it can be fun. I like that we have a bigger mod team since May. We have to make decisions for the subreddit as a whole even though people don't agree on everything, so that can be challenging. Some want any shitpost allowed, others are tired of shitposts and want to see less of them, for instance.
 

>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub? 

>>**u/Airsay58259**  I love catching up on episode discussions. That's where the best theories and jokes usually happen. As for specific posts: I love me some Caitlin's faces (which even lead to a new subreddit) and behind the scenes look at the show. We have some amazing shitposts too. 

>##Do you have anything to say to the present and future subscribers?

>>**u/Airsay58259**  I know the subreddit used to be a lot more fun and now there's a lot of negativity since the last season(s) weren't well received. That often happens to TV shows subreddits sadly. But there's a big team of mods now making sure people keep the discussions civil and put a minimum of effort in their submissions. One thing that it seems people want more of: text posts with theories, discussion... A lot of that happens in the episode discussion threads but everyone is welcome to make text posts to discuss the shows. Unless it's to tell us Ralph Dibny was announced dead in 1x07, then you'll be greeted by wolves and I may be one of them.

>##Anything else you want to add? 

>>**u/Airsay58259**  We created chat rooms a few weeks ago and so far it's been a positive experience for r/FlashTV in my opinion. It doesn't take away anything from the subreddit and people are pretty chill, so come and join. Starting October we'll try live episode discussions for other time zones in the chat, since it's something our international subscribers and West Coast Americans have asked for a long time but wasn't easily manageable in the subreddit with only 2 pinned posts allowed. So that might be fun.

**189,257** *Justice League Members* for **9 Years!**


The r/DCcomics subreddit is place for fans of DC's comics, movies, fan creations, video games, and anything else related to one of the largest comic book publishers in the world, and home of the World's Greatest Superheroes!
 
I am a huge comic book lover, I enjoy characters from all of the different comic book publishers and companies whether it be Marvel Comics, Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, IDW Publishing, or Valiant Comics but DC Comics has always been the one that captured my heart the most. So getting to frequent r/DCcomics is a joy, getting to connect with other DC fans around the world is an eye opening experience because you find out just how global the fandom really is.
 
 The mods are dedicated to giving you the best possible experience. Whether its one of their many weekly posts like Ask the veterans, Ask the Veterans, Off-Topic Tuesday, Collections/Purchases, Friday Free Talk, Saturday Open Book Discussion to their character of the Month where they spotlight a different character into the spotlight, CotM threads are made near the end of every month where you can nominate your favourite characters for their chance to win. Spotlights on these characters will be made sometime during that month.  


Whether you want to discuss the comics, graphic novels, films, cartoons, video games r/DCcomics is the place for you. The moderators work really hard to keep the environment on the sub very welcoming to new and old fans alike. They prides itself as being a friendly and polite community. All users are expected to act in accordance to Reddiquette and the Reddit User Agreement. As a frequenter of the sub I really appreciate it they really go out of there way to make you feel welcome.

Now, let's hear from the mods of r/DCcomics!
>#1. What motivated you create/moderate this sub?

>>**/r/DCcomics Mod team**  We weren't around for the creation of the sub 9 years ago, but we were all active members of the community, and were more than happy to help maintain the friendly and open environment that the subreddit has. For many years, the comic book hobby has been seen as confusing and intimidating, even though superhero media has been more popular than ever. The world of DC is ingrained into pop culture, thanks to a wide selection of media adaptations on film, TV, and gaming. But despite developing great interest in DC through acclaimed animated shows (such as Batman: The Animated Series, Teen Titans, Justice League Unlimited, and Young Justice) and video games (such as Batman: Arkham Asylum and Injustice: Gods Among Us), many fans find themselves hesitating to get into the comics, whether its due to the decades of continuity, the difficulty of finding an entry point, or some of the negative attitudes that are sometimes associated with the fandom. Our goal for the community is to make sure that no one feels unwelcome for being new to the fandom, provide a place to discuss the latest stories, and make it easy for fans new and old to discover something new to love.

>##What's moderating the sub like? 

>>**/r/DCcomics Mod team**  It's not always easy but it can be fun. I like that we have a bigger mod team since May. We have to make decisions for the subreddit as a whole even though people don't agree on everything, so that can be challenging. Some want any shitpost allowed, others are tired of shitposts and want to see less of them, for instance.
 

>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub? 

>>**/r/DCcomics Mod team**  Oh, we have quite a few.
First, there's the [Young Justice renewal thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/5bpjmy/young_justice_season_3_officially_announced/), which hit /r/all and became our most upvoted post ever. There was much cause for celebration that day.
Then, there's our [Rebirth Announcement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/4c11je/dc_rebirth_announcement_megathread/), where the community watched a livestream of DC announcing creative teams for its big Rebirth relaunch.
Also popular are /u/beary_good
's FAQs for DC's various relaunches and events, such as [Rebirth](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/511vju/rebirth_faq_20_electrical_reboogaloo/), [Metal](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/6t2llu/eli_hal_jordan_what_is_this_dark_nights_metal/), and [the 2018 summer events](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/8d36gr/explain_like_im_a_guacamole_dc_summer_2018_events/). DC is fond of launching big event comics to re-vitalize interest in their comic lines, but it can be confusing for some to keep track of all the reading orders, crossovers, tie-ins, and spin-offs. These FAQs collate all known information into one readable post. The title ""ELI Hal Jordan"" refers to the lovable Green Lantern Hal Jordan, who is [said to have an IQ of ""a guacamole""](http://i.imgur.com/PgVPBAZ.png) and [isn't known to be the smartest hero around](http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2f0dbmt&s=6).    Next, there's /u/dmull387
's [personalized recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/3ijtfi/the_udmull387_7th_anniversary_dc_comics/) made for the 7th anniversary of the sub. /u/dmull387
is a moderator who has been collecting comics for over a decade with a wide range of interests spanning from the skies of Metropolis and Opal City to far away planets like Thanagar.
And last but not least, we have our recent AMAs with all-star creators such as [Scott Snyder](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/8l3e1j/im_scott_snyder_writer_of_dcmetal_dcnojustice_and/), [Francis Manapul](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/8n0tlb/im_francis_manapul_writerartist_on_trinity_better/), and [James Tynion IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/8osl0z/im_james_tynion_iv_writer_of_detective_comics_the/). These AMAs were a collaborative effort with DC's public relations team, and have proved to be very popular with readers. 

>##Do you have anything to say to the present and future subscribers?

>>**/r/DCcomics Mod team**  Come on by and say hi! Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everyone was a newbie at some point. We even have [a weekly Sunday thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/search?q=ask+the+veterans&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) just for asking questions!
Just don't ask about who Dick Grayson's true love is. Really.

>##Anything else you want to add? 

>>**/r/DCcomics Mod team**  Be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_dccomics) for the latest sub update, DC news, and memes. But mostly memes.

"August 12th, 2018 - /r/WonderWoman: Dedicated to Wonder Woman in all her many forms!",109,96ozop,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/96ozop/august_12th_2018_rwonderwoman_dedicated_to_wonder/,4,"#/r/WonderWoman

**6,656** *Wonder Fans* for **7 Years!**

 
The /r/WonderWoman subreddit is Dedicated to Wonder Woman in all her many forms: comics, TV, cartoons, film, and merchandise. You can also expect to see some wonderful art made by fans and members of the community!

r/WonderWoman boasts a dedicated mod team, a stunning layout, and a welcoming community where fans young and old can come connect over the most iconic female superhero. While the subreddit has been running for around seven years the activity and participation have increased with the success of Wonder Woman's first feature length film, and its sequel currently filming. This is truly a wonderful time to be a fan and I would really recommend joining the ever growing community. 

I have had a wonderful experience every time I've frequented, the sub the community is really open to new users and from my experience just want to help if someone has something they would like to know about the character. They even have trade lists for those who are new to Wonder Woman and want to expand their knowledge of the character. These trade link posts contain information about all the trade collections of Wonder Woman and their contents.
   
Now, let's hear from the mods of /r/WonderWoman!

>#1. What motivated you create/moderate this sub?

>>**u/Ohmsta**  Honestly, my love of Wonder Woman. When I started as a mod, there were fewer than 600 members on the board. I wanted to turn this place into a worthwhile source of discussion and information for Wonder Woman fans new and old.

>>**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  The same as Ohmstar, I just love Diana and all she represents. I brazenly messaged the mods here more than 2 years ago asking if I could join the team and here I am. 

 

>##What's moderating the sub like? 

>>**u/Ohmstar**  Super chill. Despite many attempts, we don't have a large amount of activity, and most of the conversation is civil. When something big happens, like her movie release, things get a little more hectic. We have a great community of users. 

>>**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  I was very ill recently and I'm enjoying a time free of a lot of the usual life turbulence, I wake up every day and check the mod queue and it gives me a sense of purpose that I otherwise would have lacked. It's quiet here but I enjoy that we're free of the political nonsense a lot of reddit is swayed by. I don't think I've ever had to deal with something worse than people trying to blatantly sell stuff. 

 

>##What has been your favorite incarnation of Wonder Woman so far?

>>**u/Ohmstar**  Can I say all of them? Honestly, I've loved so many versions of Diana that it'd probably be easier to list the ones I don't like (haha). The version of Diana that I return to the most often is George Perez's '87 reboot. His whole run, including the period after he stopped doing the artwork, is this gorgeous epic tale. Every time I re-read it, I discover some new layer. I love the way Aaron Lopresti draws Diana. So vibrant. I have a tattoo of his Wonder Woman artwork.

>>**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**   I love the Greg Rucka Diana from Volume 2. I've been re-reading it recently, and there's a very good reason as to why it's so iconic at this stage. But Alex Ross' art of her in his work, and his one shot Spirit of Truth is so definitive as well. 

  

>##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**u/Ohmstar**  I always look forward to creating the Upcoming Wonder Woman Collected Editions threads. I love collecting Wonder Woman in trade and hardcover, so I enjoy when the new catalogs are out. My favorite posts are the fan art and cosplay images. I love seeing all of the different interpretations of Diana, and all of the people inspired by her.

>>**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  I like seeing people cosplay her too. I love seeing all the fan art that gets posted. I upvote all of it because it's clear that people put their heart into it, and she'd be appreciative of all of their effort just as I am. I personally enjoy uploading comic book screenshots so that casual comic movie fans might be swayed into venturing into the scary world of the Wonder Woman graphic novel lol.

 

>##Do you have anything to say to the present and future subscribers? 

>>**u/Ohmstar**  I want this sub to be a fun, enjoyable place to share and discuss Wonder Woman. Feel free to message the mods with any ideas you may have! And if anyone can create great looking subs and banners, please reach out.

>>**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**   I want to say to have the same attitude as her when it comes to commenting and posting. This is a positive subreddit, we all share a love of a character who is known for being kind and giving. Lets follow her example as much as possible. 

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**u/Ohmstar**  Support your local independent book and comic book retailers. Check out Wonder Woman bi-monthly from DC Comics. Preorder trades/collected editions so the companies know there is interest!

>>**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  I love Diana because her comics have got me through literal years of illness. I don't have the best health, and there have been many times when her strength and ability to stay kind despite the odds and keep going have inspired me to do the same. The fact that her movie was so good meant the absolute world to me. It is cliché, but it's the truth.

**51,677** directors *living in a series of tubes* for **6 years!**

I could tell you all about this sub. How the community is helpful in ensuring that everyone understands the best practices for managing a YouTube channel. I could tell you how it's a discussion-centric sub with no tolerance for spam. I could tell you about its Discord and other affiliated social media. Instead, here I have /r/NewTubers moderator **/u/MoriartyHPlus** to tell you first hand. 

#History of the subreddit

NewTubers was started in July 2012. It was a linkdump for YouTubers who wanted to get clicks. 

Two years ago in 2016, it changed moderatorship, and it's mission was shifted towards providing community-driven assistance and direction for small creators. Much of the help provided to creators is not designed for people just starting out, it's for people with years of experience--and we wanted to change that. 

Since we switched over, we've grown from just over 5000 subscribers to over 50,000 subscribers, and we've seen creators like [Chilly Panda](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1nM46_BMKq4vd4jmd6iMHA), [Eckhart's Ladder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp6F1mQGuaXiDj5otWBmIjg), [Messy Minimalist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8ox3EOfy1F5OT3ONmznJg), and many many more creators come through our doors on their path to building, creating, and sustaining a content creation career.

#The big dos and don'ts of YouTube 

For new creators, it's difficult to condense ""How To YouTube"" into a short list, since it's so varied for every individual, but here's a quick Top 10 Do's & Don't's that generally works for everyone:

- Do Network. Meet other creators, get their input, create content together, and support one another on social media and by engaging with one another.
- Don't Sub4Sub. The Algorithm isn't dumb, and this kind of activity can seriously detract from your channel's overall health.
- Do Use Social Media (Properly). Social media is fantastic for building a community around your channel, and helping your audience learn to care about your content.
- Don't Spam. This should be self-explanatory, but no one wants to watch your video just because it's in front of them. 
- Do Learn Patience. Most creators take years to get to the point that they're creating content that is widely consumed, and successful. Be patient.
- Don't Stop Uploading. It can be difficult when you're seeing 5-10 views on a video to continue creating, but if you keep it up...well, it could be the very next one that pops.
- Do Just Start. Seriously. Just start creating. You don't need to spend six months planning. Most creators pivot to different content at least once before they see success.
- Don't Spend Lots Of Money. You'll never see that money back. Think of it like a hobby when it comes to budgeting, you should only spend what you can afford.
- Do Treat It Like A Business. Content Creation puts you in competition with the best in the world one-click away. Think like a business when you make decisions.
- Don't Forget To Have Fun. Regardless of everything else, do what makes you happy. Enjoy it. Have fun. Not only will you be happier, but so will your audience!

**4,027** normal human beings  for **3 years!**

To an outsider, the furry fandom might initially seem like a weird, but ultimately cute and innocent hobby involving dressing up in mascot suits and pretending to be cartoon animals. If you’ve ever spoken to furries online, they’ll be quick to tell you such - making sure to downplay or deny the existence of any freaky sexual undertones that you may have heard of which run beneath the surface of their fuzzy image. The truth however, is much more sinister – the furry fandom is in fact a fetish community masquerading as an inclusive, nerdy and child-friendly group, often misleading people about what the core of the community really is. A survey taken by furries showed that 92.8% of the community admitted to being consumers of furry pornography (also known as yiff), with 82.6% saying that sexual furry content was their main interest within the group. ^[Source](http://whatarefurries.com#sex)

/r/yiffinhell, named after the old internet adage adopted as a response to furries being obnoxious and overly perverted on message boards, aims to showcase the especially cringeworthy, maladjusted and perverted elements of the furry community to those who are unfamiliar: ranging from [visiting a children’s hospital in a semen-stained fursuit](https://i.redd.it/kynqvr5u7qmz.png), to [masturbating into customers’ sandwiches while working in a Subway store]( https://imgur.com/a/6cSoA). Many furries also harbor strangely extreme right-wing political views, with a subsegment of [alt-right](https://i.redd.it/prm3gud4adb11.png) and [Nazi furries]( https://i.redd.it/hhws5h098c711.jpg) that call themselves ""Alt-Furries"" existing within the community’s umbrella.

While the subreddit has been running for around eight months, we’ve seen a large spike in activity and participation in recent weeks, so we’re pretty glad to be taking off.  Whether you want to find the most horrifyingly cringeworthy content you can find on the internet, or are morbidly curious about the freaky underbelly of the fandom that furries try to hide from the public eye, /r/yiffinhell just may be the subreddit for you.

**377,456** for **2 years**!

  


The subreddit was inspired by [this meme](http://i.imgur.com/W5GfYJH.png). We look for posts with excellent, well defined rhyme and meter, as well as good humor and clever content. Good posts are flaired ""True BootTooBig"" while not so good posts are flaired ""Small Boots"", and users who put in good submissions get a user flair ""True BTB: n"", with n indicating the number of True BTB submissions they have made. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/8wmutz/roses_are_red_henry_cavill_is_dreamy/) are [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/90y8tm/itsy_bitsy_teeny_weeny/) [examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/8zf72h/roses_are_red_ice_cubes_are_cold/).""


We are **r/boottoobig**, the ultimate subreddit for expressing your memes in poetic form. This sub was started when our lead mod and benign overlord u/epicblob wished for there to be a collection of memes of the form _""Roses are red, violets are blue, [insert a meme punchline that will rhyme, too]""_, and found that it didn’t really exist yet. The solution was this subreddit. Our name is inspired by **[this meme](http://i.imgur.com/W5GfYJH.png)** that epicblob wanted more of.

It has been two years since then; two amazing years where we’ve seen the sub grow immensely in number of subscribers and viewers as well as the quantity and quality of amazing memes. We’ve hit Trending over 25 times in that period and are currently among the top 500 subreddits based on activity and subscriber count.

Here are some posts that encapsulate what this sub is about:

- [Roses are red, Jordan could dunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/7wk30j/roses_are_red_jordan_could_dunk/?st=jke8ltsx&sh=6ce74c9a)

- [Roses are red, ice cubes are cold](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/8zf72h/roses_are_red_ice_cubes_are_cold/)

- [Roses are red, I put jam on my crackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/8dk5er/roses_are_red_i_put_jam_on_my_crackers/?st=jke8lx7b&sh=673bd59d)

- [Itsy bitsy teeny weeny](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/90y8tm/itsy_bitsy_teeny_weeny/)

- [Roses are red, that's a nice lamp](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/comments/88dhym/roses_are_red_thats_a_nice_lamp/)

We emphasize the importance of good rhyme and meter in our posts, and regularly reward users who submit intelligent, topical content that is well written, funny and well received by our burgeoning community. Excellent posts are given the flair ""**True BootTooBig**"" and the submitter is given a custom user flair ""**True BTB: n**"", with **n** signifying the number of such good submissions they’ve posted. While we do not encourage posts with bad rhyme or meter, such posts (usually flaired ""Small Boots"") are welcome on Small Boot Sundays. We host a contest called ""**Boot of the Month**"" at the start of each month, where we gather the top 10 posts of the previous month and invite our users to vote for the best submission. The winner is rewarded with a special user flair and a month of Reddit Gold. We execute all these features using our wonderful bot, u/boot_size_judge.

"August 7th, 2018 - /r/SubChats: Your directory of subreddit chatrooms.",104,95bf0y,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/95bf0y/august_7th_2018_rsubchats_your_directory_of/,4,"####/r/SubChats 

**1,728** users *talking* for **1 month!**


By the time that this feature is published, two things will be true:

1. All subreddits will have access to create chatrooms. 
2. About 30 percent of users will have access to these chat rooms. 

How to get to subreddit chatrooms? 

Well, if you're in the redesign, you can look in the sidebar of your favorite subreddits to see if they have a chat. If not, then look to see of mods have posted a link to a chatroom anywhere. 

However, /r/subchats is your best bet for finding subreddit chatrooms that you might be interested in. 

How does /r/SubChats work?

Users link a chatroom. You can search the sub to find the chatroom or use the directory in the sidebar. 

Why chat on reddit?

In my opinion, reddit is rolling this feature out to keep more users on the site. Hundreds of subreddits (including this one) use third party apps, such as Discord, Slack, and IRC for community chat and moderator backrooms. Television-based subs most heavily use chat for live and post episode discussion.

Here, moderator /u/MajorParadox explains why /r/SubChats exists and its mission. 

>>I was very active in r/community_chat, which is the subreddit for the new chat feature. They needed help so I offered to help moderate it.  One of the most common questions that comes up there is ""how do I find chats?""  All we could tell people was ""go check subs you like on the redesign and see if they are in the sidebar"", ""join some chats and see the recommendations"", or ""check our limited list of suggestions in our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/community_chat/wiki/faq).""

>>Of course, those answers weren't very helpful, so I had the idea for an r/newreddits type sub.  Instead of sharing subreddits, the idea is to share chats.  Using flair categories, users can filter on them and find specific chats related to their interests.  It's a bit too early to see how useful it works, but it's been exploding since the admins included us in their posts, modmails, and now in the chat sidebar (above the recommendations).  We were also recently a trending sub!

>>As we continue to grow and see how users interact, we will try and find better ways to help share and find new Reddit chats!

**2,457** musicians *classing up the joint* for **3 months!**

There's everything on reddit, baby. There's even class. Out of all of the music subs I've come across, this one is the most interesting to me. Here's a place where musicians can go to contribute to what is the largest musician collaboration project in reddit history. It might even be the first such online community-driven project anywhere. (I didn't google-fu very hard.) 

If you play an instrument you can participate by recording and submitting performances for pieces. If you're just a music lover, you can listen to the final product, [like this production of The Avengers theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUjWCBxlRRQ).

I spoke with moderator /u/CasuallyNothing to get the skinny. 

>#How did this all get started?

>>Well initially I had discovered the /r/redditsymphony community, which had similar goals as we have now. However the sub had never produced a song and was virtually dead at that point, and a few days after finding it it was nuked! (Everything was deleted) There did seem to be a lot of interest in the idea of a reddit symphony orchestra, myself included, and I thought, ""This can't be that hard,"" and here we are!

>#What's your favorite composition you've all performed to date? 

>>My favorite project we have produced has been the '[Wind Waker Symphonic Movement.'](https://youtu.be/XqGYLQ6yZiw) It really pushed our players and showed that we have the potential to play music literature that is much more difficult than I first imagined!

># How does an average redditor get in on this?

>>To participate, simply navigate to the project post you would like to play in and you will be provided with links to sheet music and an audio track to play along with. Using a free program like Audacity, or even using your phone, you can record yourself playing the part for your instrument and send it to us with a Dropbox link found in the same project post. All you have to do is enter your reddit username (or the name you would like to be credited as) when you upload it. It's easier than it sounds, I promise!

>#What other projects exist like this one?


>>To my knowledge, there have been 3 previous attempts at projects similar to this. As mentioned earlier, /r/redditsymphony  was the one I knew of first but is now inactive. /r/InternetOrchestra was an attempt made before /r/redditsymphony however it too is inactive. Finally, and most well known, is 'Eric Whitacre's Virtual Choir.' Eric Whitacre is a very well known musician, and arguably the most well known composer of his generation, and just like it sounds he creates 'virtual choirs' for people to participate in. They are very well composed and produced, but to my knowledge he has only created choirs, not orchestras. That's where we come in! :)

Since we last featured /r/dontdeadopeninside about a year ago, the subreddit's size has quadrupled. Yet, one core principle remains the same- No matter how far humanity progresses, Don't Dead Open Inside will always exist. At least until we invent yogurt cups that don't fall over when you put spoons in them.

What is DDOI? [Don't Dead Open Inside](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontdeadopeninside/comments/5uip33/dont_dead_open_inside/) is when a sign or something with words on it is designed in such a way that it makes no sense when read correctly left to right. Instead, DDOIs are meant to be read from top to bottom.

DDOI originates from the first episode of the AMC show *The Walking Dead*, where the main protagonist comes across a door in an abandoned hospital with on it written in blood ""Don’t open, Dead inside"". Even before this episode aired, DDOI has been a common phenomenon in the real world. From [tanks](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontdeadopeninside/comments/48a5lj/eric_cartman_quote_on_an_m109_selfpropelled_gun/) to [inspirational messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontdeadopeninside/comments/7lhi6p/you_dont_matter_worry/) the results of being DDOI'd are always hilarious.

**36,555** readers for **3 years!**

I like a good subreddit origin story. This one begins with  a removed post on /r/mildlyinteresting. As all good stories, it involves alcohol. You see, /u/aznednacni posted [this image of an  outlet over a door frame.](http://i.imgur.com/9Kf6dDY.jpg) In fact, the post was titled, ""[I don't suppose I've ever seen an outlet over a doorframe](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/2gpcym/i_dont_suppose_ive_ever_seen_an_outlet_over_a/cklc1cq/?context=2),"" (but I guess that wasn't a conscise enough of a description). Anyways, in the comments /u/PurpleCoco came along to offer an explanation: 
 
>My house was built in 1955 and there is an outlet like this in the kitchen. I commented to my electrician that it was bizarre and he told me back in the day it was for a clock. They didn't have batteries so how else you gonna power 'em up?

To which OP replied: 

>Well it's at a friend's place, and yesterday was my first time there...but if the wine and I remember correctly, that is the only door to - as **/r/PurpleCoco** said - the kitchen.

>What does that tell us?

And there you have it, the birth of a great subreddit. 

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find there:

* [Hiding in a vent](https://i.redd.it/9woq55ckdhnz.jpg)
* [Well thats a strange looking lightning rod.](https://i.redd.it/zj6cws9k8kbz.jpg)

"August 3rd, 2018 - /r/ClassicMustangs: The most iconic car in history*",123,949dpe,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/949dpe/august_3rd_2018_rclassicmustangs_the_most_iconic/,7,"####/r/ClassicMustangs  

**2,409** drivers for **6 years!**

Mustangs certainly have a special allure to them, they came out at the right time to be just a bit different. Mustangs were a sporty 2 door car that can be had by younger buyers with smaller budgets with base models with six cylinders, as well as optioned out to have the big engines and luxury features desired by those that afford it and all those in between. These classic Mustang came in bodystyles of convertibles, coupes, and fastback and had packages that are still legendary today with 'Mach 1"", ""Cobra Jet"" and ""Boss"" as big names still remembered today. Ford found a huge audience and managed to sell hundreds of thousands each year. This is great for current fans too, because these cars are available in large numbers just waiting to be restored. Parts are plentiful, both original and aftermarket, and knowledge is seemingly infinite about these pony cars. Pop culture has also influenced their prestige in car culture with movies such as Bullitt and Gone in 60 Seconds.

The Mustang has changed a fair bit  since it's inception. Each generation has had its differences, but each of them a Mustang that in someway embodied a piece of the originals. Current models are the sixth generation.of the pony car. Technological advances make this one of the best Mustangs yet. Beautiful, sporty, affordable, just like the originals. However, to those of us that hang around in the sub and millions of other fans, it's hard to beat the classic body lines and feel of these car's from the 1960's and '70s.

In terms of ""Classic Mustangs"" we generally accept cars from the first generation of Mustang that start with the 1965 model year and conclude with the 1973 model (although one could argue that this generation could easily be divided into sub-generations). The later 1974 to 1978 Mustang II cars are also welcome, but they have not built the same reputation the first generation has, and their appearance is sparse. Later generations have their own subreddits as well as the all encompassing /r/Mustang subreddit

My favorite post's are those of users sharing their own cars. These are clearly the favorite of userbase as well as indicated by the top posts of the sub. Technical posts and discussions posts are certainly encouraged as well. One of my main focus on managing this sub and some of my other subreddits 
 like /r/EngineBuilding  and /r/MuscleCar is to eliminate the 'porn' posts. You know the subs (often with the 'porn' suffix at the end) where people vote on the pretty picture and move on, I did not want this for my subs. I see it as low effort and does not lead to any meaningful discussion. We have rules in place to try and ensure that some details are included with each post to have a better quality sub.

The sub is still ever growing with owners and fans alike.

>#**/u/ZadocPaet:** What car do you own? Gotta pic?

>>**/u/mcmustang51:** I do have a '67 Mustang, however I have not actually shared it on reddit... yet. I'm a bit of a hypocrite in that regard. I certainly encourage other to share their cars whether finished or in the restoring phase, but I haven't released much about my own project because I feel it isn't 'ready'.

There are some genuinely amazing pieces of video game music out there. Video games aren't generally looked at and played for their soundtrack specifically, and their music is certainly not held to the same expectations as normal music. But this shouldn't be the case; there are pieces of incidental music (music made to create an emotion within an art form: movie scores for example) that are as good, if not better than all the everyday music you hear. There are pieces of music which you like that you probably didn't even realise were incidental. You know the songs [""Morning""] (https://youtu.be/-rh8gMvzPw0) and [""In the Hall of the Mountain King""] (https://youtu.be/kLp_Hh6DKWc)? They were actually created for a play, called Peer Gynt, and they're some of the most well known orchestral works... Ever.



So where does video game music fall into this? Well, video game music is obviously meant to invoke an emotion; whether it's [high intensity action] (https://youtu.be/SSDnyVq0kao) or [extremely sad and sorrowful] (https://youtu.be/0pSe2XhlsMw), these works most certainly make scenes in games what they are, and they wouldn't be the same without them. Music in video games can make you feel all the same emotions as any other music; in fact, I'd argue that a lot of older video game music is much more impressive than some works, as with older systems there'd be large technical limitations in what ""instruments"" you can have, and how many voices you can have at once. Yet even then there were some [truly epic pieces of video game music] (https://youtu.be/e2oZtvjg5oA). Limitation breeds creativity, and you can really see that in some old game music. Hell, you can see that here, I'm writing this entire thing at 11pm on the 30th of June (because we're a very organized sub).



So now that we've discussed video game music itself for an unnecessarily long period of time, we can move onto the Subreddit Of The Day, /r/GameMusic! I'll let you take a guess at what it's about. The sub is for everything related to video game OSTs and for posting your favourite parts of an OST. Whether you want to listen to video game music, get opinions on certain soundtracks or want to just discuss pieces in general, /r/GameMusic has got it all. I'd recommend checking this sub out if you're a fan of video games, because it'll really help you to understand what goes into a video game score. When you understand the context of a piece, knowing how the piece works into the scene in a way that's often not even noticible, it really gives you a sense of respect for the composer. Plus, the sub isn't nearly as circlejerky as the shithole that's /r/Gaming. It's much easier, and more fun, if you just sit back and enjoy the tunes.

**4,062** readers for **7 years**!



/r/newwave has been around awhile and grew to nearly 4,000 subscribers without active moderation or non-default design. We recently put together a new team of active moderators hoping to develop a community.

This is a community who loves new wave music made popular immediately following punk with a more fun and commercial polish than punk or post-punk. We also just recently allowed posts that are considered new wave revival (i.e. modern music that uses a lot of classic new wave influences). 

We just passsed 4,000 subs and have a number brand new features including a [subreddit redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/newwave/comments/9160m7/redesign_and_updates/). With this redesign, we incorporated many items including a new look, post flair, emojis, user-flair, rules, and searchable flair.

Our community is very active with multiple new posts per day. The moderators work hard to add to the content, make sure the music meets the criteria of the subreddit (were not super strict snobs with the genre, but it needs to be closely related to it) and to restrict redundancy. 

Here are some of the best and most popular examples of content for the subreddit:

* [Tears for Fears - Pale Shelter](https://www.reddit.com/r/newwave/comments/6hrisg/tears_for_fears_pale_shelter/)

* [New Order - Age of Consent (live)](https://www.reddit.com/r/newwave/comments/5oafay/new_order_age_of_consent_live_in_studio_1984/)

PictureGame is a 24/7 competition hosted on Reddit!

It's easy to take part in. At any given time, the game has an active host. This host submits a picture to the subreddit, along with a question about it. Players race to answer correctly in exchange for the honor of hosting the next round.

Questions can range from ""Who is this actor?"" to ""Where are the geographical coordinates of this building?"" to ""What is the title of this painting?"" to ""What is the solution for this puzzle?"" The host is limited only by their own imagination. From pop culture to ancient history, sheet music to math problems, geography to zoology -- no SFW topic is out of bounds.

The game never ends: whether it's 11 AM on a Monday or 8 PM on a Saturday, there's always one (and only one) active round to try your hand at. The more rounds you win, the more points you earn, and the higher you climb up the leaderboard... and the more cool rounds you get to post yourself!

Here are some examples of different kinds of rounds to give you an idea:

[The ""distracted boyfriend"" meme used as a group round:](https://www.reddit.com/r/PictureGame/comments/8k5anf/round_47647_whats_the_name_of_this_shop/) As far as we know nobody had found the exact location before, so solvers had to find the street on street view and then find the name of the shop, which required a bit of extra work.

[OC Item Identification:] (https://www.reddit.com/r/PictureGame/comments/8xvduz/round_49963_there_are_18_items_here_from_18/) OP posted a picture of 18 items from different games and asked people to identify each one.

[Flag Pie Chart Round:] (https://www.reddit.com/r/PictureGame/comments/688u15/round_35398_these_are_pie_charts_consisting_the/) This round uses an already existing concept (pie charts for the color distribution of flags) and adapts it for Canadian regional flags.

[OC Scavenger Hunt:](https://www.reddit.com/r/PictureGame/comments/7fhl7o/round_41483_mark_the_locations_of_the_8_objects/) OP took a few pictures in Bergen and asked for the location of each one. Not too hard, but it makes for a nice walk around the city.



All in all, the sub is an excellent interactive subreddit; it's excellent to browse casually and fun to play. In terms of subreddit games, this is one of the best out there!

**1,000,000+** readers  for **8 years**! 

Congratulations /r/PS4, we’ve reached 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!

The PlayStation 4 has been firing on all cylinders the past couple of years. With over 80 million units sold, it should end up surpassing the original PlayStation to become the second best-selling home console of all time (for those keeping track at home, the top-3 home consoles would then be the PS2, PS4, and PS1).

This is all on the back of an abundance of critically acclaimed games for the PS4, from sequels to existing franchises such as Uncharted 4, Persona 5, or the recently released God of War, to brand new IPs such as Bloodborne, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last Guardian, and Detroit: Become Human. Not to mention mainstays like the Gran Turismo and MLB The Show franchises. There’s no slowing down for the PS4 as we near the end of this console generation either, with upcoming games like Spider-Man, The Last of Us Part II, and new IPs like Ghost of Tsushima, Days Gone, and Death Stranding.

/r/PS4 has seen tremendous growth lately. It’s the best place to go for all the latest news and discussion related to the PlayStation 4. We also have [weekly discussion threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/search?q=flair%3A%22game+thread%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) devoted to individual games, some amazing [screenshots of the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/search?q=%22%5Bscreenshots%5D+of+the+week%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) sent in to our Community on PS4 (RedditPS), and developer AMAs.  Stop by /r/PS4 to give your thoughts on the PS4's success so far and what you hope to see in the future.



Thank you to everyone who visits the subreddit!

It's been almost 2 years since this series released, and the orphans of the Grace Field Plantation are still moving ahead in this world at full steam! The Promised Neverland is a manga serialised in Weekly Shonen Jump written by Kaiu Shirai and drawn by Demizu Posuka. It's a Dark Fantasy that centres on a group of children who grow up in a happy orphanage, only to discover one day that their longtime home is actually a breeding ground for human meat to be fed to their demonic overlords! The stickler in these demons plans is that these children happen to have been raised as geniuses, in order to develop their brains to be as tasty as possible...

/r/thepromisedneverland is growing steadily and is the best possible outlet on Reddit for Neverland discussion among fans. With an anime on the way soon, consider this an invitation to join us on an epic adventure that isn't over yet!

We all love Reddit. I mean, I assume we all do anyways, seeing as you're on the site and all that. But no matter your feelings on the site and the direction it's being taken, there are still tons of subs out there. Like, hundreds of thousands. Most dead, but still a massive amount of thriving communities. In this sea of content from all over the place, with a massive array of content types, how's one meant to find what ones they like? 


Of course, there's /r/All, but even that it always filled with the same few subs. And while it's a great place to find new subs, a small subreddit basically has to hit the Reddit lottery to get up there. That's where /r/All fails. And of course, there's r/SubredditOfTheDay, which is clearly the best method of finding subreddits, with well written articles ~~that totally aren't being written 45 minutes after their release date ended~~, but even then, maybe you want more than one sub a day.So how are people meant to find those small subreddits, and the interesting content they provide?





That's where /r/FindAReddit comes into the scene. You want to find a subreddit for a specific type of content? Just ask. /r/FindAReddit is a subreddit where you can find subreddits for... Whatever you want. Seriously, there's subs for everything, I'm sure you'll almost always find one for what you want. It's an excellent resource for any newcomers to Reddit; the defaults are rather abstract in their topics, and /r/Popular suffers from the same issues as /r/All, and doesn't even have any porn as a compensation. For casual browsing, /r/all wins, but /r/FindAReddit is the best method of finding communities that fit with your specific interests, because there's no algorithm of upvotes that dictate what you see, it's just people telling eachother about cool subs that they think OP will like.

**5,151** readers for **4 years**!





Imagine a world where jokes and pranks on friends are considered as etiquette, where you buy gags and clothes using delectable jellybeans as currency, and where you can swim through rings, launch yourselves from cannons, and jump along jungle vines with your friends daily! Initially released in 2003 buy Disney Interactive, the Massively Multiplayer Online game Toontown Online had a very simple concept. You and your friends are well-known characters from Disney’s cartoons that coexist in the lovely world of Toontown. However, there is an opposing force known as the cogs, which are robot businessmen that seek to suck all the fun from the cartoon world for profit. However, these cogs cannot stand a joke, so you and your friends can use gags (such as a throwing a cream pie at a cog’s face) to destroy the cogs and restore the cartoony world. As a Toon, you start out with the two basic gag tracks known as throw and squirt as well as 15 laff points. When you reach 0 laff points, you go sad and cannot fight another cog until you get happier. From completing Toontasks (quests in the game to access more gags and gain laff points) to exploring the six playgrounds (or stepping foot into one of the four dangerous cog HQ’s!) to enjoying things on the side such as golfing or racing, the possibilities in this world of fun are as limited as your imagination!


However, the history of Toontown Online was not all fun and games. After the release of the fourth and final cog headquarters in 2008, it was clear to many that Disney was starting to move on from the game of Toontown. The game started to become updated less and less until it closed its doors for the final time in September of 2013. However, while Disney was ready to move on from this cartoon world that thousands have gotten to know and love, the community was unwilling to let go. The same day that the closure of Toontown Online was announced, a group of community members announced a private server known as Toontown Rewritten, or TTR for short, which seeked to continue the storyline and development of Toontown Online in a way that Disney would have. Despite a lack of experience that a corporation such as Disney had, the game opened for everyone exactly one year after Toontown Online closed, on September 19th, 2014. However, the progress did not end there. Ever since then, a crazy amount of progress has been made on this fan server to make it the best it could be. The fourth cog headquarters, Bossbot HQ was redesigned from the ground up, original features in the game were redesigned, tweaks were implemented as suggested by the community, and in September 1, 2017, the game left open beta, bringing two new Toon species with it. To this day, the TTR team continues to add updates to the game and keep Toontown alive outside of the game as well, which includes hosting panels at gaming conventions. TTR’s fourth annual panel will be held at ReplayFX later this July.

Final paragraph was supposed to have links, so here it is revised:

While TTR has been very successful over the four years of its lifespan, nothing would have been possible if it were not for the amazing community supporting the game. The hub of the community for TTR can be found at the subreddit, /r/ToontownRewritten. Every week, events are hosted in the game for both stronger and weaker Toons so that members of the subreddit can meet each other and make friends in the game. Every once in a while, the subreddit hosts contests both in game and out of game for prizes that are exclusive to few members in the community. Members of the community are chiming in with [fan art](https://www.reddit.com/r/toontownrewritten/comments/8uf20v/i_drew_one_of_ttrs_fabulous_composers_yorke_the/), concepts and ideas to make the game better, and are answering others’ questions (as well as making a few memes)  to make this fifteen year old franchise as engaging and friendly as it was originally made to be in year one. The TTR community has even been able to [establish a connection with those that were designers of the original game](https://www.reddit.com/r/toontownrewritten/comments/8x6mkd/meet_the_minds_behind_toontown_online/) and have gotten support from them to keep making the game in their original views. The subreddit has recently been able to rally together and donate thousands of dollars after a Toontown content creator named Kong tragically passed away. The subreddit has also helped raise thousands of dollars for the Extra Life foundation during three-day long streams known as Toonfest for Charity runs, which happen about 2 or 3 times a year. And finally, the subreddit has [worked together](https://www.reddit.com/r/toontownrewritten/comments/88kocp/hey_surlee//) to [solve the puzzles](https://www.reddit.com/r/toontownrewritten/comments/7t1ehx/megathread_for_loonylabsnet/) set out by TTR on their website loonylabs.net which has involved encryption, sorting out words using specific sound frequencies in a bunch of white noise, and much more. All of this (and much more!) is why TTR and the Toontown franchise has continued to stay strong for this long.



So what are you waiting for! Hop onto Toontown Rewritten today to enjoy the thrill of battling cogs and exploring the world of Toontown! Just hop on over to https://www.toontownrewritten.com/ today to experience the lovely cartoon world with a decade and a half of history for yourselves, and stop by the subreddit today for discussion, artwork, and much more. Are YOU Toon Enough?

It's a 50/50 chance, hence the name. Still, please be aware that some of the posts in this sub could possibly be disturbing to some readers.***



&nbsp;



####/r/FiftyFifty




**753,730** Gamblers for  **5 Years!**

&nbsp;

We all love a gamble at times. Whether that's a little £5 bet with your friend, or a massive £10,000 stake at a casino, or participating in the ***snap*** a few days ago (see the 2 features before this if you haven't yet), we're all at least a little attracted to the thrill. And while that thrill can often be extremely destructive, and not at all something to be taken lightly when the stakes are high, it's still something that intrigues us all.



/r/FiftyFifty seeks to take that thrill to Reddit. Each post on this subreddit has 2 outcomes, usually a good one and a bad one. While the good one is often, well, good, the bad one is sometimes rather NSFL. So by clicking any link, you are risking your day being ruined (assuming it's a ""true"" 50/50, that is).


This leads to a subreddit in which it's rather dangerous to even click a link, which is rather unique as far as subs go (if course, there are subs exclusively for NSFL stuff, but if you're clicking links there then I'd assume you know what you're getting yourself into). Since the 50/50s are user made, there are often posts that can be [rather humourous] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/comments/4or8vg/5050_rick_astleys_new_single_from_his/), and others that are just [plain scary no matter what you get] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/comments/60on2s/5050_girl_in_borat_swimsuit_nsfw_old_man_in_borat/). All in all, the sub is like a game within Reddit itself (*cough* /r/Game *cough*), and I recommend you all give it a try, and hope you don't get unlucky.


To finish off, here is a few words from one of the moderators, kindly conducted by my fellow writer coolscorpion_83:



&nbsp;


> **1: Why does someone need to visit this sub?**

>> **/u/PlushSandyoso** It's thrilling. It turns Reddit on its head because you no longer know where the link is going to take you. That leap of faith is one of the reasons it's been so heavily featured on YouTube.

> **2: What are some of your favourite posts on the subreddit?**

>> **/u/PlushSandyoso** One of mine, actually.

>> https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/comments/69tkhx/5050_cool_look_at_a_beating_heart_nsfw_woman_dies/

>> An integral part of the sub is the dichotomy between good and bad, enticing and dissuasive, or compelling and mundane. Often, people will post gory options as the bad one. I wanted to see if I could present something frightening as a positive option. This successful reversal of that expectation makes it one of my favourites.

> **3: What's it like moderating the subreddit?**

>> **/u/PlushSandyoso** /r/FiftyFifty is already a game, so you get to play it a lot more.

>> We try to explain our rules so that everyone understands why they're there, and I'm often impressed by how well the community follows them.



> **4: If you could describe this sub in three words, what would they be?**

>> **/u/PlushSandyoso** I can do it in two.

>>Caveat emptor. (Buyer beware)


> **5: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/PlushSandyoso** We'd like to find more posters, but we're very cautious about how we get them. Features on YouTube have caused us to get a lot of new users, but they're often young. Most problematically, they post poor quality YouTube content they've stolen from other channels, and that's something we strictly monitor. We'd like people with more interesting perspectives to post, but we need them to also understand the rules and the reasons for them.


> **6: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/PlushSandyoso** We really want the Reddit Mobile team to improve the new user experience. We sometimes get treated like tech support because new users don't understand the role of the mod in the Reddit community. We're here to cultivate a sub and to take it in an interesting direction while maintaining a certain level of order along the way.

**554,540** ( /2 **277,270**) children of Thanos for **3 Months!**




It's a simple calculation. Original content on Reddit is finite. Upvotes, are finite. Memes, shitposts, bandwidth, server capacity, bots, are all finite. But the subscribers are growing exponentially. Just in the past week, the amount has tripled. Left unchecked, the entire subreddit would have collapse into nothingness.

But we understood the problem. We were willing to sacrifice everything for the greater good. We, the children of Thanos, crafted the bot to remove half the population, gathered the scattered 6 pieces of the subscriber list, and fought off the fierce opposition of u/spez and the Reddit engineers. We did this all to bring about perfect balance to our subreddit, as all things should be.

Those of us who remain would like those who have turned to dust be remembered. Their sacrifice was not made in vain.

And we, the remaining, know our duty. We may have brought balance to our sub, but others still suffer. We shall turn our sights to greater heights, and bring eternal balance to all of Reddit.

You can dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arives.

**33 995** cat lovers for **1 year!**

Kneady cats are a class apart for cats aficionados.  This one sub is for those who can't get over the cute, tweeny little act of kneading observed in some cats, whether they are making biscuits, kneading dough, or massaging a happy cat owner.  There is no discrimination.  We enjoy some classic [cats learning to cook](http://i.imgur.com/20E8qvH.gifv), [tough cougar ready to pounce](https://i.imgur.com/roPQfTF.gifv), [clawy cuties](https://gfycat.com/AdorableSelfassuredFoxterrier), or even [big derps planning to rule the world](https://i.imgur.com/zuFutJu.gifv).  

Let's not forget some Reddit classics as well, [mild NSFW](https://i.imgur.com/JhgzUCZ.gifv).

Why do cats knead? Some experts say it's a leftover behavior as a kitty getting nursed, and as an adult cat it becomes an act of happyness, comfort and well-being. Or as an instinctual behavior for patting down foliage to settle down, much like dogs' digging behavior.  

We might never know, but while we're at it, let us just enjoy some gifs of these cute little beasts.

Please enjoy /r/KneadyCats, as part of our network of cats subs currently holding the [Admins hostage](https://old.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/comments/8x01cv/trending_subreddits_for_20180708_rcatsoncats/) and thus currently a trending sub.

**10,981** readers for 18 days!

Have you ever watched a movie trailer and saw that amazing action scene, funny line, or creepy moment and thought wow! I can’t wait to see it, then it never arrives when you watch the movie? Well, that us!

The idea behind this subreddit came from many trailers I’ve seen recently, specifically comic book movies, looking at you Infinity War and Justice League. I thought that this has to happen pretty often and started looking into and found it was pretty common. Movies are one of my biggest interests and figured this has to be on interest other people would have and probably noticed.

At the time of writing this we are just over two weeks old, but we are already over 10,700 subscribers and featured by Reddit as a trending community. New content is posted all the time and we have some pretty big events planned.

The best comment I saw about us was r/movies, r/MovieDetails, and r/NotintheMovie is my perfect trio of movie subreddits, and I’m inclined to agree! I hope you’ll check us out, and tell us what scene you really wanted to see from the trailer!

**4,161** noun *verb* for  **1 Year!**

^(*though it's effectively only been a community for 26 days since the trailer dropped, but I digress*)

&nbsp;

There was *a lot* to get hyped about in this year's E3. So many good games were announced from tons of companies. Bethesda, in particular, had an excellent conference:

And, of course, the one everyone was super hyped for: The Elder Scrolls VI. I could gush about TES for hours and all the semi-baseless theories I managed to get from a 37 second trailer, but this feature isn't about /r/ElderScrolls, so I'll spare you for now. Just before the TES 6 trailer dropped, there was another small trailer, that, while not getting as much hype as some of the titles announced, certainly excited a ton of people. The trailer was for a new, original IP named Starfield.



Now, we know very little about Starfield. We know it's a game, set in space, with a cool space station and some explody thing in the background, and... That's about it, really, as far as solid facts go. According to ~~God Howard~~ Todd Howard, one of the lead developers, it is ""The biggest, most epic science fiction thing you can possibly imagine."" That's a pretty massive claim, and, as expected, it's generated a lot of hype. This hype has lead to the somewhat premature birth of /r/Starfield.


/r/Starfield is fairly chaotic right now. Not in a bad sense, of course, but at the moment there's not really much we know. It's a little bit like /r/Mother4 (Winter 2014, guys). In the future, it will, of course, be a subreddit about the game Starfield, but at the moment there's no game. So currently, the sub is filled with theories and discussion about the unreleased game. What type of game will it be? Will it be on a new engine? Will it be procedurally generated? Will it be a TES/Fallout style RPG? What the fuck was that big explosion in the trailer?


As of right now, most of the answers are non-existant. We don't know almost anything about the game. So we're currently just analysing the trailer and making theories and hoping the game lives up to the hype that has been artificially generated. Personally, I'm hoping that it doesn't have the ""No Man's Sky"" effect, in that there's so much hype generated that the game can't live up to it. But this is Bethesda. They're a large company, who have apparently been working on this game for years. So for now, /r/Starfield will be hyped, and will discuss everything there is to be discussed.






&nbsp;



Starfield looks promising to me. Of course, there isn't much to look at right now. But what's there, and what we can deduce from Bethesda's usual style looks really good. Imagine Skyrim in space. No, scratch that, imagine Morrowind in space. Mmm.



If you're excited for Starfield, head over to /r/Starfield, and jump on the hype train. Check out some theories, or watch the trailer frame by frame 25 times, and wait for the next announcement, and the discussion that comes along with it.

The world cup is the world's best football teams competing in an competition to become the winner of the tournament, and to become the world's the best team. The competition happens every four years in summer time - June to July - thirty two teams compete in the competition, with qualifying taking place up to three years before the world cup starts. In UEFA, (Europe) there is 6 pots for the teams to put into groups, with pot 1 being the best ranked teams from 1- 9 while pot 6 contains the teams ranked 46-52, each six team group contains teams from every pot, so for example, Wales ( rank 10 at the time) couldn't play England ( rank 9 at the time) since they was both in the same pot.

The world cup has giving us some beautiful memories over the years, from the famous [Cruyff Turn,]  (https://youtu.be/U1k7DGqRF5g) to the [Zinedine Zidane headbutt] (https://youtu.be/zAjWi663kXc) to [probably the most famous world cup goal] (https://youtu.be/HXtd8CiBr2s) to the [7-1 Brazilian destruction by Germany] (https://youtu.be/a7IMPsyQg6k)



-----



The world's current champion is Germany, having won the world cup in 2014, however, Germany suffered an humiliating exit in the group stage after losing against Mexico 1-0, and losing on the last game of the group 2-0 to South Korea. This was the worst result from Germany since 1938, we all know what happened the following year.




# Records in the world cup


* The most successful team in the world cup is Brazil, having won the world cup 5 times.


* Most goals scored in world cups, Miroslav Klose, 16


* Youngest goal scorer, Pelé 17 years and 239 days, Brazil Vs Wales

&nbsp;



""Incompetence"" can be used to describe a worryingly large portion of the population. In our daily lives all of society relies on people being able to do their jobs. It's scary, the amount of trust we put on others in order to keep the world running. But generally, it works out. There are lots of ""easy"" jobs out there, and usually those incompetent people get one of the ""easier"" (obviously it's all relative) jobs. And they can do those jobs, and life around us continues. 


But even with these seemingly easy tasks, people still, stupefyingly, find a way to fuck it up.


/r/OneJob is a sub that highlights people fucking up at the simplest of tasks. Like seriously, you had ONE job! And you fucked it up.

^(hence the name, of course)


Your faith in humanity's ability to function will drop significantly upon going through the posts in this sub. Really, is it THAT hard to [make a children's book maze] (https://www.reddit.com/r/onejob/comments/763kiu/perhaps_you_can_help_rocco_get_home/), or [fill in a drop down menu properly] (https://www.reddit.com/r/onejob/comments/8tpfb2/ok_im_native_to_chipotle_now/)? Or even just [do the thing that you went to school for and get paid to do professionally] (https://www.reddit.com/r/onejob/comments/7snyv9/photographer_has_no_idea_how_to_retouch_photos/)? This sub shows that there are people who can mess up even the most basic of tasks. Remember that next time you're driving on the road with a bunch of those idiots.

There's a lot of stuff that goes into writing a good piece. You have to build a melody, get a countermelody, get a harmony, some chord progressions, get an overall structure, and so much more depending on what you're writing. I'm sure most of the people reading this have never even heard of terms like ""secondary dominant"", ""tritone substitution"", ""subdominant function"". There's so much that goes into making music that most musicians don't even know it all. And while most popular music these days mainly sticks to major/minor keys (or Ionian and Aeolian if you want to sound fancy),  I-V-vi-IV chord progressions and basic homophony, that's not even scratching the surface of what some musicians have thought up. Welcome to the magical land of Music Theory, where you learn the rules of music then realise that those rules are arbitrary and there are no rules, then you realise that there are rules but there aren't at the same time and oh my gOD WHY IS THIS SO COMPLICATED.




Anyways, /r/MusicTheory is just that: a place to discuss music theory, ask for help about various things related to mucus theory, and to expand your knowledge on music theory. Don't worry if you don't know much about theory; many people on the sub dont. The sub is rather welcoming to new people, and there's no elitism like you'd expect from the ""classical music is the only good music"" stereotype you often see around the subject. Hell, the sub can be [downright funny at times] (https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/7aus4m/best_way_to_play_b_flat_major_scales_fingering/). If you're interested in learning about theory, want to figure out why a special song sounds like it does, or just want to make a cool chord progression, /r/MusicTheory is the perfect subreddit for you!

**132,069** *onion chefs* For **1** Year!

There's a lot of scary things going on in the world today. Here's just a few of those things:




* The USA is only **182nd** alphabetically as of today, being surpassed by even Afghanistan and Mexico.



* Due to the melting of polar ice caps, there has been an upsurge in protesting from evil villians who have been having their secret lairs exposed.

* Mass shootings in schools have gotten so had that President Trump has been forced to ban schools.



&nbsp;



Scary, right?


If you read through those and believed any of them, then congrats! You just ate the Onion!


For context; [The Onion] (https://www.theonion.com) is a satirical news site, that create ""news"" stories about the most extreme of things, that the rest of the media is afraid to report on. If course, it's all fake as fuck ([here's] (https://www.theonion.com/logan-paul-i-didn-t-realize-people-who-commit-suicide-1822460035) a personal favourite of mine), but it's still a hilarious place to read, made even more hilarious by the people who actually believe it's real. 


""Eating the Onion"" refers to falling for an article by the Onion (or any satirical news site), believing that it's actually real. Since you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe that stuff, it's no surprise that you find it most often on Facebook. /r/AteTheOnion is a subreddit made to document these monumentally idiotic responses to the articles.



The sub isn't exclusive to The Onion, it can be any satirical site. All that matters is that there's someone eating it up. The sub is filled with screenshots of people reacting rather violently towards these articles. There's a massive amount of these stupid people, [even government isn't safe from the stupidity] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AteTheOnion/comments/89efpt/lawmaker_unironically_starts_statement_on_the/).



It's a blend between r/insanepeoplefacebook, r/facepalm (without the r/facepalmfacepalms) and r/theonion, and these characteristics make it an excellent sub to browse through, and laugh at other people's stupidity the whole time. Ah, Internet.

**7,031** brave adventurers for **6** years!

Mystery Dungeon is a franchise developed by Spike Chunsoft, a company which you have probably never heard of unless you’ve played their games. Of course, the Mystery Dungeon franchise includes many different games, but the definite defining set of games are the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, which is what I will be referring to.

Unfortunately, a lot of people are daunted by one of two things about the series: 1) it’s pokemon, and 2) it’s a dungeon crawler. However, get past the cover and you’ll find an amazing story inside.

And that’s what Mystery Dungeon is all about. The plots are comparable to what you would see top the box office. In fact, I believe that one of the only things holding back the story is the target audience, which unfortunately causes a lot of the greatness to go by unexposed to most people. 

Also, don’t even get me started on the other aspects of these games. Character development is present everywhere, even in side characters (Gates to Infinity). Plot twists are everywhere and always seem to completely destroy you immediately. And, while the gameplay is perhaps hindered by the fact that the games are dungeon crawlers, it is very clean and easy to learn.

As for my own experience, the Mystery Dungeon games definitely gave me some new standards for a game’s plot. Gates to Infinity was the first video game that ever made my cry, Super Mystery Dungeon was the first game that I felt a full sense of completion on (Super Mario 3D World got close but I couldn’t beat the last bonus level), and I got into emulation just to play Rescue Team.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this franchise for anybody hoping to try out a new and interesting combination of mechanics. There are so many more things I could say here, but I don’t want to make this post too long, so let’s just skip to the interview, kindly conducted by /u/conalfisher.

## **Interview with the moderator team of /r/MysteryDungeon**

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled** I was a fan of Mystery Dungeon and a few years ago I saw the moderators were inactive on reddit so I requested the subreddit, and instead I was made a moderator as well.

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o** So, /r/MysteryDungeon has always been one of my favorite subreddits, going back to probably 2013. I followed it pretty consistently, which was easy enough seeing as how there would only be like one or two posts per week. Given the inactivity, I had started to wonder if there was anything that might be able to make the sub more lively. I think in the process of that happening, I ended up considering reddit requesting the sub, only to find that there had been a very recent one by /u/TooSkilled. When /u/AnEpicPerson ended up actually responding, we both brought up instead being brought up as mods, with myself willing to give CSS a shot. At that point, the sub was 100% standard design with no CSS, so anything would be an improvement. Even though I didn’t know too much, I brought together my google-fu and /r/csshelp to complete a basic redesign, and add some extra flairs, of course. Over the next while, I helped to continue working on the overall design of the subreddit.

>> **/u/thekoreansun** Just a little over three years ago, I woke up one morning to the news that a new Pokémon Mystery Dungeon game would be releasing later that year and, understandably, became super excited (pun not intended). I'd only just gotten into Reddit at the time, and considering that I was the only one I knew who was thrilled by the announcement, I decided to see whether there was a subreddit for the Mystery Dungeon games. And there was! A community of about 300 users who were celebrating the news, just like I was. I don't remember exactly why I decided to stick around, or why I requested to become a moderator a few weeks later, but I'll always be thankful that I did. Since then, I've been able to watch /r/MysteryDungeon grow into one of the most welcoming and friendly communities on the Internet, and I'd like to think that I had a hand in making that happen.

>> **/u/aalp234** A little over 2 years ago, I found /r/MysteryDungeon and was lucky enough to connect with all these people who loved the same game series as I had for years. For a series which left an impact on me until today, this was a big deal.



> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled** The other mods do all the work and I do almost nothing. I delete a comment occasionally or make a wrong decision about leaving Age of Ultron spoilers up 🤔

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o** In my opinion, the community almost moderates itself (except when it comes to flairs, haha), and everyone generally tends to get along pretty well. It goes without saying that it's one of my favorite communities on reddit

>> **/u/thekoreansun** /r/MysteryDungeon is the first and only subreddit I've ever moderated, so I don't have any context behind my experiences there and how it compare to other subreddits. But even so, it's been an absolute pleasure to be a moderator for my fellow Mystery Dungeon fans. Even the occasional absence of a post flair won't change how much I enjoy seeing everyone discuss, share, and collaborate on a daily basis.

>> **/u/aalp234** It’s honestly quite calm, we have a fantastic community here. Personally, /r/Mystery Dungeon served as a stepping stone for me to start moderating the much larger /r/europe, but I remember my roots dearly.



> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled** [The greatest post on the sub of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDCirclejerk/comments/3jlf7o/heres_the_long_awaited_phase_hope_youre_all_braced/)

>> **Note from the editor:** This isn’t actually in the right subreddit, but I’ll let it slide. :)

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o** ~~Shitposts aside~~, I love all of the creative projects that have come out of the community, and all in all just seeing more people express how much they love these games that I also hold dear to my heart.

>> **/u/thekoreansun** It's always impressive seeing the immense creativity of the people in the community at work. Some of my personal favorites have been the amazing remixes of PMD tracks and the countless top-notch memes that have graced the subreddit.

>> **/u/aalp234** Artwork takes the cake for me, as well as some of the fanfiction that fantastic writers make. Some of those stories could be games themselves!



> **4: Which Mystery Dungeon game is your favourite, and why?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled**  I’ll probably be alone in saying Blue Rescue Team. It’s probably entirely nostalgia but I think Blue Rescue Team has a lot of charm to the story and the writing, but it knows when to get to the point. There are times in the later games where you’re watching cutscenes of things that happened to you a minute ago. I also prefer the story of Blue Rescue Team. Plus the music for [Buried Relic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX4b37e3Cqg)

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o** My favorite mystery dungeon game would undoubtedly be Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. The story really stands apart as being really unique and compelling. The music, too; I could go on for a long time talking about it, and it definitely has my favorite soundtrack. There’s just such a palpable level of charm that you can really feel from the game. There may be a little bit of nostalgia invested in it too, but I just really love it.

>> **/u/thekoreansun** They're all great for their own reasons, but Explorers of Sky will forever be the one closest to my heart. All of you already know how much of an impact a good story can have on someone, and for my younger self, it brought up an emotional response that I haven't really experienced since. Compassion and confidence, selflessness and sacrifice; all of that is overwhelmingly present in this game. The fact that I can replay my copy of Sky yet another time and still find myself shedding a tear at the heartwarming moments is a testament to just how special it actually is.

>> **/u/aalp234** I’d have to say Explorers of Time, it was the first game which I truly connected with in my childhood. It was quite honestly mindboggling to my young self the level of emotional depth that it went into, so much so that the game remains immensely deep and interesting even after all these years! Explorers of Sky was also fantastic in the sense that it wrapped up loopholes in the already existing story, leaving a lot of fans (including myself) very happy.



> **5: Which Mystery Dungeon game would you recommend to any newcomers who want to get into the series?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled** Explorers of Sky is probably a better place to start, especially if you’re completely new to the series and know nothing about it. Just go download a ROM because the game’s like 60 bucks that’s too expensive I have kids to feed.

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o** If you want to really get into the series, I’d say go for Explorers of Sky. It’s got a huge amount of content. From there, I’d personally recommend PMD1 -> PMD4. One thing I’d advise is that unlike reviewersdon’t be afraid to take your time getting into it.

>> **/u/thekoreansun** I'd recommend everyone to play Explorers of Sky at least once; it's just that good. But the other PMD games are also great for beginners and veterans of the dungeon-crawler genre alike. Mechanically, I'd say that all of the games have the same underlying simplicity that makes them accessible, but Rescue Team and Super Mystery Dungeon are the more difficult entries in the series. Gates to Infinity had some ideas that made it stand out despite its limitations, so that's another solid option. As for the non-Pokémon variety of Mystery Dungeon games, I haven't ever had the chance to get into them, but it's important to note that they are much less story-driven than their PMD counterparts.

>> **/u/aalp234** Explorers of Sky, for sure. It’s a refined and developed version of Explorers of Time/Darkness, and the story is absolutely fantastic! It blows 95% of modern game’s storylines straight out of the water.



> **6: In your opinion, what is it that makes the Mystery Dungeon series so memorable?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled** When you won’t give Mankey chestnut

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o**  I think that it’s just that the game has a certain charm to it, and really pulls your emotions along for the ride if you let it. Through the music, art, and plot, it really goes about building atmospheres in a special way. And, of course, no spoilers, but there are some really special and heartfelt moments well known to bring players to tears.

>> **/u/thekoreansun** I've already touched on it a bit, but every Pokémon Mystery Dungeon game has a fantastic story to tell. There aren't too many games that can claim to have the same level of presentation and quality in the story department as Explorers of Sky or Gates to Infinity. But the gameplay of the series is also pretty great, and while it is somewhat hit or miss, the way it blends the mechanics of the main series Pokémon games with the random nature of rogue-likes makes it so that fans of both can have a blast playing through them. And the music! Ah, it's so amazing! There's [Brine Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3CSEricqRE), and [Scorching Desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7Uv-D-7VSQ), and [On The Beach At Dusk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFIJFPepVts), and... wait, I should probably just let you discover how great these tracks are on your own.

>> **/u/aalp234** The story. Period. I’m not embarrassed to admit it, I cried when I played Explorers of Time, and people who have played the game through its entirety will know precisely the moment that we all wept at. The music is also out of this world: Go search up some of the songs and you’ll know what I mean! Especially as someone who knows the story inside out, listening to the soundtrack also brings back rich memories from different parts of my adventure.



> **7: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled** See question 8

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o** Looking forward, it really depends on when the next major installment in the Mystery Dungeon franchise comes about. Up until then, we’ll try to keep fostering our stellar community. If and when the next game is announced, we’re sure to get a large uptick and hype, so we’ll just have to hold out until then.

>> **/u/thekoreansun** Honestly, I'm not sure! Like /u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o said, it all depends on what the next PMD installment brings to the table. I do think it's about time that I let AutoModerator take care of the flair notifications from now on. If anyone knows how to configure it to do so, we would greatly appreciate you letting us know!

>> **/u/aalp234** Much like the others, it depends what the future holds! We’ll keep moderating this community with love and care, for it deserves all of that and more. We can only hope that the PMD series is revived in the near future, but if the current titles is all we’ll ever get, it’s still more than enough to have one hell of an adventure.



> **8: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/TooSkilled** When I joined reddit I would have never thought I’d be moderator of a subreddit of the day subreddit. But I didn’t really do anything. All of the other mods put in all the work, koreansun, epicperson, lucario, aalp, they did everything I was just the dingleberry on the asshole of success. Thank you guys so much for putting in a lot of hard work, you made the subreddit truly great and one of the purest communities on reddit. Anyway long story short I’m deleting my reddit account after this subreddit of the day post goes up. I did it Julian! I’m free! **PUSH CHAD GABLE! PRAISE KEKLEON!**

>> **/u/l_u_c_a_r_i_o** I guess there is one thing: despite most of the posts and the banner, we aren’t solely about Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Other titles, such as Etrian Mystery Dungeon and the OG Shiren The Wanderer have a place here too! The pokemon titles just get a little more attention since they’ve got a bit wider of an audience, I guess.

>> **/u/thekoreansun** Honestly, just... thank you. To all of my fellow mods for being partners I can depend on, to the people over at Nintendo and Spike Chunsoft for making these incredible games a reality, and to everyone over on /r/MysteryDungeon for being so kind and respectful to one another. The Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series has done more for me over these past few years than I ever thought possible thanks to you guys, and I hope that we all continue to talk about the games we hold so dear to our hearts into the distant future!

>> **/u/aalp234** I’d like to truly thank the /r/MysteryDungeon community, with special mention to my fellow mods, for all that they’ve done these past few years. I talked with a lot of you when I was going through hard times and it really did help me get through them. This community was also crucial to me being able to land the job as /r/Europe moderator, where I’ve developed as both a reddit mod and as a person immensely with the team over there. Without you, this wouldn’t have been possible. YOOM-TAH!

**4,023 readers** for **4 years!**

It's been an even longer time since I featured /r/OneTruthPrevails back [on November 4th, 2016](https://old.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/5b3p6n/november_4th_2016_ronetruthprevails_when_you_have/). It's been quite a long time still since I featured it for [the first time on November 29th, 2014](https://old.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/2nqdi5/november_29th_2014_ronetruthprevails_with_a_keen/). It's been growing steadily ever since the first feature, now at nearly ten times the size. I could have waited a few months and made it an even two years, but again, I fall short of that goal through impatience and the temptations of pizza. Oh, how I've changed. I'll leave some details out of this and point you toward the previous features for more.

Detective Conan is an anime/manga series that has been running since the Paleolithic era. As of this writing, it has 904 episodes and 1012 manga chapters. There have been 47 opening themes and 56 closing themes. Twenty-two movies, twelve OVAs, a side series with its own manga, six 'magic files', six TV specials, two more movies that cross with Lupin III, countless soundtrack CDs, a live-action drama series, thirty-seven video games, real-world cafes, an airport... Detective Conan has spawned more things than Genghis Khan.

What it is is a mystery show. A teenage detective reverts to the body of an elementary schooler, keeping his mind, as a result of a criminal organization who now thinks he's dead. Hiding his identity, he moves in with his friend/love interest and her professional detective father (who is pretty bad at his job). To take down the criminal organization who poisoned him he must solve crimes and piece together clues all the while protecting himself and his friends and family. He does this by using deductive reasoning, investigation, and a series of gadgets built for him by his friend Professor Agasa such as a voice-changing bowtie, a stun-dart wristwatch, and (showing the show's age), a portable fax machine. I know, it's very high tech stuff we're dealing with here.

Detective Conan first came to America under the name Case Closed, a dubbed show with some changes and only fifty episodes being aired on TV. It was in this time, around 2004, that I got into Case Closed. I forgot about it for quite a while after that until, in late 2006, I found several Case Closed DVDs at, oddly enough, a corner grocery store's $1 bin of random junk. This was the same day I found a copy of Beyond Good & Evil for the GameCube at the same place. I don't know how they obtained these things, but I paid my dollars and went home happy. A marathon of Case Closed later I tried to find the rest of the DVDs and instead found out that the anime didn't spontaneously stop without an end and that, at that point, there were over four hundred episodes of the series. Well, that was that.

I never did obtain the rest of the DVDs in no small part to the unbelievable price. The dub goes all the way to episode 130, but to my understanding, a lot of major content is cut out from it which would make continuing from where it left off a difficult task. I did look into getting some collectibles, maybe a replica of something from the series. If I had to pick one, I'd choose Gin's Porsche 356A. I mean, my god. The man has taste. Short of that, I'm content with watching alone. If you came to hear about the manga, I apologize, but I'm not a manga person. Not even the good manga can make me fall into that medium.

Want to continue discussing Detective Conan and Case Closed? Check out /r/OneTruthPrevails, [the Discord Community](https://discord.gg/WubfVgH), and get to watching. Episodes 131+ are on Crunchyroll, but you'll need to search up the early ones (or ask on the subreddit/discord, I imagine). I highly recommend it.

This has created some [mildly infuriating](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexpectedOuija/comments/7fgx6h/we_almost_succeeded/), [funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexpectedOuija/comments/8kqif8/found_on_me_irl/) and [truly amazing](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexpectedOuija/comments/7cnjn3/the_spirits_have_visited_rgaming_to_curse_ea/) posts.

>#1. What's the best thing about the sub?

>>**/u/IwataFan**  One of the best things about Reddit is finding subreddits dedicated to really unexpected things. Unexpected Ouija is perfect for Reddit because it's a common thing to see in comments across the website and I think it just really captures the fun spirit of Reddit.

>##2. Which post is your favourite?  

>>**/u/IwataFan**  My favorite post is [""O spirits, you failed us.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexpectedOuija/comments/7zh2xr/o_spirits_you_failed_us/) A short but sweet message from the spirits, which somehow makes it even more funny to me.

In conclusion, I recommend visiting /r/unexpectedouija, as it's a great place to observe the hivemind on their travels, or to just have a good laugh. I've certainly enjoyed moderating it so far.

[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheQuibbler/comments/8kvge1/let_the_countdown_till_summer_start_the_quibblers/) are some [examples](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheQuibbler/comments/7nwp3j/relive_the_magic_of_the_holidays_with_our_newest/) of the content we [produce](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheQuibbler/comments/6ng9h4/sorry_for_the_slight_delay_but_heres_the_quibbler/) every three months. 

Our community is a wacky place for lovers of Harry Potter to gather and have their art and writing showcased in a beautiful digital magazine. We accept submissions from anyone (so long as they're SFW) and every submission we receive gets used. Submissions don't have to be related to Harry Potter, we have thirteen ""departments"" that are happy to take anything relating to their titles. From News & Features to Fashion to Travel (to name a few), we are happy to include Muggle stuff! 

We're a friendly community with inside jokes and we're always happy to get new people on board. We could also use more hands on Layout and Design, so anyone who has a background in Adobe inStyle and Adobe Photoshop can help us out. The Quibbler has been used in portfolios and listed on resumes (the Editor-in-Chief is fully willing to be used as a real-life reference).

**515** motorists for **2 months!**


Here is a SFW place where redditors can share pics/videos of their cars. People put a lot of work into their cars and this sub gives them the opportunity to share it with the rest of the world. All cars are welcome, no matter how old or ""average"".


Here are two post that won the Monthly Sidebar Contest. The first is [this pretty Subaru](https://i.redd.it/w76xdbwn09z01.jpg) owned by /u/ pvjinvtion. 

The other is [""Rainy Days""](https://i.imgur.com/14bn18q.jpg) by /u/Animal-Crackers.

Other quality posts are:

* /u/MuddyJK's [480 hp V8 Wrangler](https://i.redd.it/tpxarq5m3ar01.jpg) 

And: 

* /u/Portageee's [old and new muscle]
(https://imgur.com/D2svWWX) 

Finally, here's a pic of the car owned by the editor of this piece: 

* [1964 1/2 Ford Mustang](https://i.imgur.com/WVghWmQ.jpg)

r/AmateurCarPorn was created as a spinoff of r/CarPorn. The sub wants to showcase the affordable cars and give Redditors a chance to showoff their own cars, which many of them put a lot of work into. Its a perfect sub for people who love to look at cool cars, but are sick of seeing exotic, unaffordable cars covering the front page.

Are you a fan of Baby Driver? Scott Pilgrim? Shaun of the Dead? All of these films were directed by Edgar Wright. 

Now there's a subreddit for dedicated his fans and their memes! 

With hilarious posts ranging from simple, yet funny (https://i.redd.it/2h2nola1y1s01.jpg), to awesome crossover memes with subs like r/NolanBatmanMemes and r/IncrediblesMemes (https://i.redd.it/cad87lnile011.jpg), and even some hilariously meta posts (https://v.redd.it/a983fpgr5tz01). 

The community is small, welcoming, and shares a great love for Edgar Wright, as well as movies in general. If you've never seen Edgar Wright's movies, or this sub, then check them out, make some memes, enjoy some movies, and have fun.

**3,602 readers** for **1 year!**

If you know the player, and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred adventures. It also helps, of course, to have a good table. Sun Tzu didn’t have access to GM Forge, otherwise known as the Game Master App, but if he had, I bet he would’ve written a chapter on the rolling of dice.

The subject of today’s session is the adventure of one /u/noobulater and his quest to create a virtual tabletop software that runs tabletop RPGs better than the competition. It’s biggest competitor is, of course, Roll20. It’s second biggest competitor is probably Nestle as, I’m guessing, they probably own tables as well as water and the nation of Panama. What GM Forge does better than the competition comes in multiple parts, but for this I will forego the nature of a software review and instead talk about the community around the subject. You see Noobulater, or as his friends call him, Noobulater Alligator, is the sole developer of the software and has taken his indie desires to the second level by interacting constantly with fans and users. Having purchased the software some time ago, I have previously exercised my right of communicating him by making use of the industry-standard flag semaphore outside his window. Of course, for those lacking in a large collection of flags (E.g, users not subscribed to /r/vexillology), you can also use Discord.

The quest that Mr. Noob has undertaken is one that appeals greatly to me. I run a weekly D&D game in the Edition-That-Must-Not-Be-Named that came before 5E, and because of the technical, legal, and romantic limitations of space, my players and I are separated by quite a bit of planet. Never one to be dissuaded, a virtual tabletop, used to interlink nerds together, comes in useful. Currently we use MapTool, an ancient Java application that is as bare bones as a cow lost in the Mojave. If you didn’t recoil in terror at the words “ancient Java application”, then you clearly saved on your Endurance saving throw. Most of us didn’t. Still, Roll20 is so limited that in order to use more than six bits of storage you need to cut off an arm and mail it in as payment like some kind of fourth world sweepstakes. The ability to download and host a Roll20 instance with limits disabled is a prompt which warrants the reply of “tut tut, why is this unwashed peasant in the belief that it may speak to his lordship?” The question is: Does GM Forge fall to either problem?

Obviously not. As a lawyer in a book once said, never ask a question you don’t know the answer to. As a marketer probably appended, don’t ask a question if the answer isn’t a good one. I’m not a marketer, so I can ask myself things like why I get up in the morning, but in this case it fits. GM Forge has light limitations when used online, but has a freely downloadable software version that allows the only limits to be your imagination. Upgrades to your imagination are, also, pretty cheap, and can usually be found hanging around Taco Bell on weekday afternoons.

GM Forge, of course, does have features the others don’t. Built-in scene shifting with things like weather and time of day are great for the inevitably unprepared DM who didn’t expect his players to turn a simple forest fetch quest into a brawl at the local temple. It has built in sheets for all varieties and is system-agnostic by design. Turning that statement back into the community - users have access to scripting that enables them to build their own features and share them on the Steam Workshop for others to use. Still no 4E system, but then, it’s fresh from the software stork, so no blame there. As time goes on I expect more users to add more and more, infinitely, until the raw mass of their data collapses and forms a data hole, which is like a black hole, but trendier.

As I type this I’m reading the GM Forge channel on Discord now (which is accessed from the subreddit's sidebar). Bugfixes, video tutorials, mods, and a channel where users can vote on new features. People ask for help and help is given. Usually by the developer, sometimes by users, sometimes by living wizard paintings. At least, that’s how I like to imagine it. It’s what you expect from a nice Discord community. What more can I say about it? It doesn’t rhyme with Tomato. Or is it pronounced Tomato? Let us know in the comments.

You may be asking yourself, “Xavier! What if I don’t have a group to play with?” Well, dear reader, the answer is /r/lfg. Now you have no excuse. Get some friends, get GM Forge, and go play some tabletop RPGs.

**116,850** readers for **7 years!**

Not everyone has fun in the same way. Not everyone wants to, or even can, wake up hungover and go to work all the time. Alcohol is a staple of the American stereotype from the party-happy teenagers to the lazy father figures on TV. It gives us courage, removes our filters, lightens our loads, and makes us think we can do things we can’t. For some people, it’s a source of extroversion. For some, it’s a force of destruction. It kills the mood, lowers our spirits, and makes us do the things we think we can but can’t. It kills people.

Hi, my name is Xavier, and I’m an alcoholic. I have been sober since 2009. I’m not ashamed of who or what I am, or at the lack of control I had over myself that enabled me to make those decisions. Like everyone else, I remain as flawed as ever, but like an ass with a crack in it, this isn’t wholly abnormal. Quitting drinking was a challenge for me. AA didn’t work for me and I had very few people I could talk to. I was agitated, easily annoyed, and worst of all, drank so much lemonade just to drink *something* that I turned into a lemon. Little known fact about me - I’m a lemon person. There’s a lot of us out there. We hold parties.

So, /r/StopDrinking. The name says it. It’s a support group for Redditors who are quitting drinking. As I said above, not having someone to talk to made me agitated and easily annoyed; more so than usual, anyhow. StopDrinking helps that by providing that support community for whatever you may need it for. My favorite feature is the Daily Check-In thread. Each day a post is made asking users to make a 24-hour pledge to not drink. The idea, it says, is to not set out for a day trying not to drink, but to make a conscious decision not to drink. This difference is larger than it may seem. It’s the difference between allowing yourself the excuse and committing to the goal. The subreddit has weekly posts on Saturdays and Sundays, and they’re all pretty active. As of this moment writing the [Check-In post for today has 358 comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8pgvg2/the_daily_checkin_for_friday_june_8th_do_it_with/)

Did you know that /r/StopDrinking was [featured last on October 4th, 2011](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/l032p/october_4_2011_rstopdrinking_join_other_redditors/)? At the time it had 330 subscribers and had been around for nine months. It was so long ago that it was even written by this subreddit’s founding father, /u/SRotD himself. The man, the myth, the mayonnaise. Check out that feature for some more information, and to see how times have changed.

Are you looking to stop drinking? If so, give /r/StopDrinking a look, check out the resources on /r/Alcoholism, and browse the many great subreddits linked on both. You’re the only person who gets to decide what your life is going to be like. If you want it to be free of alcohol, it can be. It’s not easy. If it were easy everyone would do it. Theodore Roosevelt said that nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, and difficulty. He said he had never envied a human being who led an easy life but had envied a great many people who led difficult lives, and lived them well. Do what’s hard, and do it well.

Upcycling is a very interesting subreddit about all things upcycling. So you might ask what is upcycling? And whats the difference between upcycling and recycling? Well, Recycling takes waste products, breaks them down, then forms them into something new. Upcycling is reusing waste or unwanted materials without destroying them in order to create something new, which makes upcycling more energy efficient than recycling.



Some good examples of posts on /r/upcycling can be stuff like this one, [where a user shows his creation from some scrap fire hoses he found](https://i.redd.it/dko6o8ps8lxz.jpg). This is a great post because its always fun to see what everyone creates and upcycles. Another nice post is this one, [where a user takes an old piece of furniture and makes it new and cool](https://i.redd.it/d4qc96s439yz.jpg). You can often get a lot of inspiration to do stuff yourself which is always fun!

We also have a monthly ""Upcycle challenge"" where users get a theme and then they post their creations in comments. All participants get a special flair which they can ""level up"" if they participate in more challenges.

**301,430** Platriots *begging for decent dishes* for **2 years** 

Let's be honest. When you order food, you expect it to come on a plate, right? So, when you get something [served on a bed of rocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantPlates/comments/8pprew/dont_bite_in_to_the_rocks_theyre_overcooked/), you immediately wonder... WHERE THE HELL IS MY PLATE? That's where WeWantPlates comes into play. There's a sort of one-up-manship there, trying to find the funkiest ways to serve food.

For example, you can find [the longest chocolate turd served over ice cream in a toilet shaped bowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantPlates/comments/8ppsto/like_from_a_toilet/)... Like, where's the normality here people? Oh, that not strange enough for you? How about we serve [ice cream in a dust pan?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantPlates/comments/8pli1j/ice_cream_in_a_cone_is_great_ice_cream_in_a/) Yeah! The weirdness doesn't end there, but it's also where the truly interesting comes into play.

For example, when you thing of a barbecue, what's the first thing you think of? Ribs, right? Maybe a picnic scene, friends and family gathering around enjoying their favorite foods? Betcha never thought of [ribs being served on a mini picnic table, huh?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantPlates/comments/8pnhgb/mini_picnic_table_with_ribs_on_a_small_sheet_paper/) The platriots over at /r/WeWantPlates just can never seem to find the weirdest things.

**1135** rudimentary subscribers of blood and flesh for **4 months!**

[Sit down, young ones. I’m going to tell you a great story.]( https://i.redditmedia.com/Uc24STGhlCh_wv9nkLV3D5KRnsY7SbyAtO3ixG37vsk.png?w=464&s=ea3c4680618b1c043c8200dbdadc739e)

I’m sure you’ve heard of Mass Effect, an RPG series made by Bioware. Any such masterpiece of game design naturally deserves to be [memefied]( https://i.redd.it/zo1hk8xeprl01.jpg) by the peoples of Reddit. Since r/MassEffect doesn’t allow any memes and r/MassEffectmeme is as dead as the Reapers after the Destroy ending, I present: r/MassEffectMemes.

> Rudimentary subscribers of blood and flesh, you touch my subreddit, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.

> There is a realm of memeity, so far beyond your own you cannot even imagine it. I am beyond your comprehension. I am /r/MassEffectMemes.

> 'Shitpost?' A label created by the normies, to give voice to their destruction. In the end, what they chose to call us is irrelevant... we simply, are.

> Non-memetic life is nothing but a genetic mutation, an accident. Your lives are measured in years and decades, you wither and die. Our memes are eternal, the pinnacle of evolution and existence. Before us, you are nothing. Your extinction is inevitable. We are the end of everything.

> Confidence born in ignorance, the cycle cannot be broken. The pattern has repeated itself more times than you can fathom. Non-memetic civilisations rise, evolve, advance and at the apex of their glory, they are extinguished.

> The reposters were not the first, they did not create the 'Internet', they did not forge the 'Routers,' they merely found them. The legacy of my kind.

> Your civilisation is based on the technology of the Internet, our technology. By using it, your society develops along the paths we desire.

> We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end, because we demand it.

> Our memes transcend your very understanding, they are each a work of art, independent, free of all weakness. You cannot even grasp the nature of our existence.

> Your words are as empty as your future, I am the vanguard of your destruction. This exchange is over.
The Mass Effect universe has a quite high meme potential. The universe itself [has]( https://i.redd.it/b2h4gpao61v01.jpg) [many]( https://i.redd.it/cf79ylie7ro01.png) [memeable]( https://i.redd.it/jytx9twbxqg01.jpg) [moments]( https://i.redd.it/20tjd43rn2w01.jpg), providing [prime]( https://i.redd.it/0luccpkg54s01.jpg) [meme]( https://i.imgur.com/hfCQRct.jpg) [material]( https://i.redd.it/k1e5322yjho01.jpg) for us, and the real life [controversies]( https://i.redd.it/igdlfgobjdo01.png) also lend themselves to some [memes]( https://i.redd.it/yv6kmm4mfhq01.png). We can also fond parallels with other [meme genres]( https://i.redd.it/u2yg05addzk01.jpg), as we have done during the [Great Meme War of 2018]( https://i.redd.it/nz5400qtnxn01.jpg).

This is a community that fights the constant censorship that you find on Reddit. We are a kind of archive to classify the unfair bans and power-abuse that is exerted by some moderators.

We have been completely redesigning the sub recently, adding CSS, flair filters, and such. In the last week, our small community has gained 400 subscribers (total count of subscribers being 4300 as of now).

Exceptional content: 

* Top post of all all time: [User reveals that Gallowboob has been sending him THOUSANDS of dad jokes in the last three months]	(https://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/8navn4/gallowboob_has_been_sending_me_thousands_of_dad/)

&nbsp;




Sometimes people make a subreddit, intending to moderate it and grow it. But they can't find the time, or simply don't know how to. There are tens of thousands of dead subreddits out there with a good concept, but are neglected. Maybe you yourself have a sub like this, one that you made, but you didn't know what you were doing, and it died. If you have one of these subs, and you want to give it new life, then /r/AdoptAReddit is the sub for you.


Over on /r/AdoptAReddit, you'll find many different types of subs, up for adoption. If you're looking to take in a sub and grow it, or want to give your sub to someone who knows how to look after it better, this is the place to go. To give a sub up for adoption, all you have to do is just make a post saying that you want to put it up for adoption, and wait for someone to come along and ask for it!


All types of subs can be found here. Video game subs, reaction gif subs, meme subs, porn subs, anything really. Most of them are very, very dead, but occasionally you'll find subs with actual communities, albeit small ones. If you're looking for moderator experience and don't feel like going through /r/NeedAMod, this is the perfect place to go!

**12,203** voice actors *doing jobs* for **6 Years**

The world of voice acting is often times competitive. You're bound to face competition, especially for larger roles. There's never a free space for an amateur to get in a role. Never a way of just... *sticking your foot in the door*, you know? At least, there wasn't, until now.

Enter /r/RecordThis, the subreddit developed specifically for voice actors needing work! Here, Reddit users can post [requests for actors](https://www.reddit.com/r/recordthis/comments/8gkwrx/paid_request_40_obo_authoritative_female_voice/) as well as participate in the monthly [Aircheck](https://www.reddit.com/r/recordthis/comments/8g884m/aircheck_may_2018/) and [Demo threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/recordthis/comments/8g894t/demos_may_2018/) where they can show off their skills (or sometimes [lack thereof...](https://www.reddit.com/r/recordthis/comments/8g884m/aircheck_may_2018/dyap8u4/)) and get critiqued and praised for their talents. Understand though, even work here is limited, but far more open. And, due to the posting guidelines of /r/RecordThis, pay should be openly offered, unless otherwise unavailable.

>If you do ask us to record something, all we ask for is that a $5 suggested donation be made to the actor. 

>If you honestly cannot afford this and you have a non-profit/educational need, explain your situation, along with what non-financial compensation you are offering (discounts, professional services, advertising space, etc.) 

>You can also check out out /r/recordthisforfree.

So, with 12,000 different actors, actresses, producers and more, why does the subreddit seem so... inactive? Why does it feel barren and abandoned? Believe it or not, actors and producers can end up making a good working relationship and actors can end up being retained for later! Who knows, maybe doing some small project could lead to a lifetime of work with a producer (even if they become famous, eh?). 

If you don't know how to get started, the sidebar also has a number of resources that fledgling actors can use to get started in the world of voice over. A lot of these resources are created by some of the big names in the industry, like [Rob Paulsen](http://techjives.net/category/talkin-toons-with-rob-paulsen/) (the voice of Pinky from Pinky and the Brain), or taken from live events like the [Voice Over Conference in Atlanta](http://voatlanta.me/). And, of course, there's tips and tricks on how to set up [your own home studio](http://homerecording.click/free-videos-page) so you too can get to working that lovable voice of yours.

With all the fun and magic of /r/RecordThis, there's gotta be someone out there who'd be willing to answer some questions about it. Thankfully, I got to the founding moderator, the BMOC himself, /u/MechaNate. He, and a couple of moderators were willing to answer some of my more pressing questions.

>#What's the purpose of /r/recordthis? Why go through all the effort of putting it together?

>>**/u/mechanate:** RecordThis started out as a fun little sub for silly answering machine messages and stuff. It sort of grew and evolved on its own. As for the reason for the effort, years ago someone gave me the initial advice and encouragement I needed to make my demo reel, get an agent, get me started. I've tried to turn RecordThis into the sort of place that gives people that first little push.

>>**/u/zVulture** /r/recordthis was created to promote a healthy community for those interested in recording their voices for hobby to professional use. Assisting in personal improvement, knowledge sharing and, most commonly, offering opportunities on voice work. As far as effort, there is no reason needed for helping people regardless of subject as it is simply we have the opportunity to do so.

>#/r/RecordThis used to get spammed with free requests, what prompted the switch to Paid Requests only?

>>**/u/mechanate:** Voiceover is an underappreciated art that tends to get overlooked in a lot of budgets. We were getting a lot of requests from people who clearly had money to spend but simply didn't want to spend money on voiceover. Not only was it insulting, but there were plenty of other places where they were free to beg. While the minimum donation rule significantly cut down on the amount of traffic we received, the quality of requests increased significantly.

>>**/u/brcomic** The change to paid was kind of like volcano in as much as it was a slow build and then finally exploded. I don’t remember perfectly what finally set it off, but I think it was someone made a post about it and then after a brief “town hall” the call was made to make it a minimal 5 dollars donation as that seemed reasonable to start.

>>**/u/zVulture** It has always been our intention to assist those interested in becoming a professional toward that goal. We found the subreddit started to draw larger free voice work that would normally go to a paid individual. This was counter to our efforts to assist others so at the cost of reducing opportunities, we instituted the Paid Requests Only rule. 

>#Were you also the one who started /r/RecordThisForFree?

>>**/u/mechanate** No. Several offshoot subs and an unofficial Discord server have been started over the years, but I didn't have anything to do with them personally.

>>**/u/brcomic** Someone else created r/recordthisforfree. I actually created r/recordfree, I think it was called? Which was technically first, but suffered from having me as a creator and my almost immediate lack of interest in running it. Poor bastard never had a chance. I’m proud to still send work over to r/recordthisforfree over mine. I’m happy they seem to be doing well.

>>**/u/zVulture** We were not the team that started /r/RecordThisForFree, it was created in response to our Paid Only rule. We do not oppose it's creation or use as it does fill gaps like voice actors looking to just have fun or practice.

>#There are some upcoming changes to /r/RecordThis, care to tell us about them?

>>**/u/mechanate** We've started a monthly demo reel thread, where people can post their current demo reel for feedback. We're also going to start hosting regular workshops on a variety of topics related to voiceover.

>#Any known success stories to come out of /r/RecordThis?

>>**/u/mechanate** We've had a number of members come in with virtually no experience, and begin to get paying work several months later. But we also have some already-professional regular contributors; RecordThis is an opportunity for them to step outside their comfort zones.

>#As mods, have any of you actually gotten roles that have been advertised?

>>**/u/mechanate** No, but I offer paid work for my own projects sometimes.

>>**/u/brcomic** I’ve never actually gone out for a role that has been advertised on the sub that I can recall. I don’t look at the sub as a source of potential income. More as a place fore others who are learning. So I try to just moderate and answer questions as I can.

>#Are any of you professional day-to-day voice over artists, or is this a hobby for you?

>>**/u/mechanate** I have an agent locally but haven't pursued any major roles recently due to life circumstances.

>>**/u/brcomic** I consider myself a professional, but admittedly I don’t go out for work that often anymore. So a professional hobby I guess? I’d love to get back into it, but life happens. In the mean time I’m happy to help others and try to keep people from being taken advantage of.

[Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe/) released on September 22nd, 2017 by Team Salvato. It took a concept, a dating visual novel, and twisted it into something…else. /r/ddlc is a welcoming community where there is often conversation about the game, along with [fan-art,](https://i.redd.it/rjkt8j1yafx01.jpg) [memes,](https://i.redd.it/b3nmlxwh5tf01.png) or [wholesome images made by community members,](https://i.redd.it/alccv14elox01.png) and even a [Project Libitina fanfiction.](https://redd.it/7tytx8) A weekly post: [Writing Weekend](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/8ixbzh/writing_weekend_may_12_2018_may_18_2018) is where one can scratch their poetry-writing itch. Its modding community, /r/ddlcmods is full of talented, hard-working individuals that have pumped out some amazing content, from one of my favorite mods, [Doki Doki Rainclouds,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCMods/comments/7zr9qr/doki_doki_rainclouds_is_officially_released/) to the well-known [Monika After Story.](http://www.monikaafterstory.com/)

I won’t say anything about what happens in the game, that’ll ruin the fun of experiencing it yourself. It’s *entirely free,* whether you find it on its [website,](https://ddlc.moe/) or on [Steam.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780) Some of you might have already seen let’s play’s from various Youtube channels. That’s how I personally discovered the game anyway (with an added bit of ‘top of the morning’s’ slapped in) But, if you’re able, play this game without looking into it beforehand. Whether you play it blind, or even partially blind, you won’t regret it.

Of course, the warnings are there for a reason. Honestly, I guess the game amplified my depression and anxiety a slight bit after I completed it, and for others, it’s caused them distress, suicidal thoughts, etc. It’s important to keep that in mind, and remember: there are resources out there, and people that care.

We made this sub as we were unhappy with the lack of moderation at the larger r/askouija and saw that it had the potential to be a truly great sub. We have roughly 350 subscribers who have been very active. 

We have a fully styled design, including a haunted night mode. We have diverted in philosophy that some moderation is a good thing which has resulted in a less toxic environment and far less shitposting. 

We have optimized the flair threshold in order to ensure more questions are answered and have instituted an extremely popular ""Friday Flair Day"" where users can ask the community to generate a custom flair which will be unique to the requester, and the requester has no input on the outcome.

I really love the small subs. Especially when I find a small sub that's small for seemingly no reason. I look at the content here, and it has a broad appeal. It should have thousands of users, not hundreds. Maybe we can help to change that. 

Ever see someone in public and thing, ""Wow, that person really is dressed like so-and-so?"" This is the sub for documenting those outfits. It's when people dress in a way that they look like someone without having done it on purpose. Hence, accidental cosplay. 

Let's look at some of the popular posts:

**30,197** people *reclaiming the swastika* for **4 years!**

As probably everyone who is reading this already knows, historically the swastika is and was used culturally by many cultures, most notably as a religious icon in India and parts of Asia. It's also still used by the Finnish air force. 

However, the Nazis used it as their symbol, and after WWII, in western culture, it's come to be a symbol of evil and hate. 

This subreddit is not for those things. Not historic swastikas and especially not for Nazi ones. It's for ones that appear unintentionally. When things are shaped like a swastika, but are not meant to be swastikas, or at least not the evil one. 

Let's take a look at some popular posts on the subreddit.

"May 28th, 2018 - /r/AccidentalRacism: For thing that can unintentionally appear to be racist",249,8mpjot,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/8mpjot/may_28th_2018_raccidentalracism_for_thing_that/,14,"Welcome to Accidental Week here on Subreddit of the Day! This week we are showing you five different subreddits that are about stuff that happens not on purpose.

####/r/AccidentalRacism 

**92,196** people for **5 years!**

First of all, I want to acknowledge that racism is a serious subject. When in 2008 Barack Obama was elected president, many rejoiced at the notion of a post-racial era. But it seemed like the longer he served the more that racists came out of the dark cracks of society. Those cracks seem to have burst open after 2016. 

During this time we as a culture have become more sensitive to images of racism. 

/r/AccidentalRacism is a subreddit about when things appear to be racist, but are not. This can be interpreted as racist, though they did not intend to be racist. Unlike the subject of racism, this is a totally not serious subreddit. 

In order to get a feel for the sub, here are some examples of popular posts with explanations. 

># [This kid wearing an ""Alone in the Dark"" shirt.](https://i.redd.it/92zexof3vjl01.jpg)
>>Alone in the Dark is a video game series. The kid is obviously a fan. He's taking a pic with his friends. The joke is that he's the only white kid in the pic. The other three kids are black (dark skinned). 

>#[This amusement park sign.](https://i.imgur.com/KP7A2zP.jpg)
>>""Yellow people"" is a derogatory term referencing the skin pigmentation of Asian peoples. 

>#[This Hallmark sign.](https://i.redd.it/wo71lpvxxnz01.jpg)
>>Here's a really good example of marketers not thinking. There's a trend in marketing to be racially inclusive. Sometimes that accidentally backfires. The white mom is holding a baby of mixed race. The sign is promoting cards for single moms. The imagery and text conjure up the negative stereotype that black fathers are absent. 

>#[This soccer match up.](https://i.redd.it/v3srjhm12rk01.jpg)
>>It's Nigeria vs. Germany, but the two countries abbreviations in that order spell a forbidden word. 

>#[These children's clothes](https://i.imgur.com/9rbtv1u.jpg)
>>Here's one that's not accidental racist, but accidentally sexist. The subreddit is not just for accidental racism, but accidental any -ism. Here the pink shirt implies that girls grow up to be nurses, not doctors. 

>#[This pizza place.](https://i.redd.it/no3u3axp26g01.jpg)
>>Here's an example of the intersection of crappy design and racism. One leads to the other by accident. The lowercase Zs in the Nizza sign look like Gs, which makes the word appear to be a no-no. 

 >#[This oldie but goodie.](https://i.redd.it/0nu2bwteqpp01.png)
>>The episode description implies that Oprah is the ape. Calling black people monkeys or apes is a favorite pastime of shitbag racists. 

>#[This ad for cheese.](https://i.redd.it/lvbpbh7s6zu01.jpg) 
>>The ad obviously means the kind of crackers you eat. It wants people who are buying crackers to also go buy cheese. But ""cracker"" is also a racial term for whites, and the picture of a white girl really drives that home. 

That's all for this showcase. Please remember that nothing is actually racist on /r/accidentalracism. Actual racism results in an immediate and permanent ban.

**56,305** Heisters *robbing banks* for **6 Years** (And they never got featured? WOW!)

In the year 2013, a daring crew of reckless criminals unleashed a torrent of chaos upon Washington D.C. The world was full of crime. Armed robbery, car theft, looting, bank robbery! Backed by the reclusive genius mastermind, Bain, these clown-masked culprits stop at absolutely nothing to drain the city's vaults and fill their own greedy pockets, causing chaos and destruction wherever they go. Fact of the matter is, there's crime amok, and no one is doing a thing about it: except you, and your team of experts. Together, you and your three friends will continue this crime spree, stealing from those who deserve it, and keeping it all for yourselves. [These are the adventures of: The Payday Crew.](https://youtu.be/sJr6K9NVuQw)

/r/PaydayTheHeist is the subreddit dedicated to chronicling your adventures and heists as a member of this elusive crew. As well, as providing you with information on the two games in the series: Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 [^(every single day of the weeeeeeeeeeek.)](https://youtu.be/Jq4_LTTCO7s?t=3m1s) Littered across the subreddit, you'll see [game updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/8lt17e/new_fbi_files_memo/), [discussion threads about a trilogy that's never gonna happen ~~thanks, Valve~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/8lod6h/what_would_you_like_to_see_in_payday_3/) and sometimes [even fan-art](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/838quo/new_comic/), depicting the heisters that you control in all their glory. 

You may even get the chance to interact with the cogs that keep the sub whole, the moderators, like I did. Either that, or /u/Overkill_Almir may sneak in from time to time and give [cryptic messages ^^not ^^really ^^tho](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/838quo/new_comic/dvh29ff/?context=3) about the status of the game and where it's going. And, trust me, you'll want to say hello to Almir [and his beard](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AC0Y1nDLbbI/maxresdefault.jpg). (It's even a mask in the game, [no joke](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/payday/images/6/6e/Almir%27s_Beard_Fullcolor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141204233752).) Thankfully, I managed to get a hold of the mods, and get their opinions and some answers about the future.

># What lead to the creation of the sub?

>> **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** That's a question for /u/kingspycrab, I've only been a moderator for a little less than 2 years.

>> **/u/KingSpyCrab**  I had gotten into PAYDAY: The Heist back in 2012, and also became more comfortable with the SPUF (Steampowered User Forums, RIP) and all the members on it. At the same time, I had also made a reddit account and familiarized myself with the website. I was told by many that there was a subreddit for everything, so I stumbled upon /r/paydaytheheist. It was very dead, had about 3-4 posts about certain updates. I put in a request to own the subreddit, and the rest was history. Initially, there were 140 subscribers to the subreddit, but I was young and determined to make the sub grow. PAYDAY 2 was released and there was an astronomical increase in subscribers. The rest is history, and I have the dedicated mod team, Discord team, and all the subscribers to thank for it.

>> **/u/CaptainCupcakez** While I wasn't around when it was created, the subreddit was made just 3 days after the release of the first Payday game. The Payday series has always had passionate fans, and right from the start the subreddit has been a huge part of the community for the games.

># Favorite Heister?

>> **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Dallas.    
>> **/u/CaptainCupcakez** Clover! Honorable mention goes to Hoxton for being my favourite PD;TH heister.    
>>**/u/KingSpyCrab** Hoxton, Dallas is a close second (OG squad)    
>>**/u/Szkieletor** Clover. Shotouts to ~~Simpleflips~~ Sydney for a very visually interesting first-person viewmodel, shame you can't see it in VR. Chains was my PDTH choice, and my PD2 OG.

Fucking Dallas and Hoxton mains... I swear. (I too am a filthy Hoxton main, ass breath, dick head, twat, Houston or whatever you call him just wasn't a suitable substitute. Needed more Pete Gold.)

># What's going on with the story?

>> **/u/KingSpyCrab** Dude, I have no idea.

># Why can't we see Bain's face?

>> **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** He's shy.
>> **/u/CaptainCupcakez** The world isn't ready for that...    
>> **/u/KingSpyCrab** Because he's ugly.
>> **/u/Szkieletor**  Still building hype for the face reveal. Imagine the revenue when that drops.

># Where do you expect the story to go from here? Where's the endgame?

>> **/u/KingSpyCrab** I like where the story is going, mystery and teasing is OVERKILL's strong suit, and I'm expecting the elusive ""secret"" to make itself known in the coming months.

>> **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Hopefully another secret vault hidden in a current heist similar to Overvault, with the resolution of Baldwin and Cagliostro's feud. I'm hoping Giancarlo Esposito comes back and voices some final lines for the story resolution.

>> **/u/Szkieletor** Conclusion to The Secret. I also wouldn't be opposed to the gang falling apart and then slowly coming back together for PD3.

># The Thermal Drill, [did you go get it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsW2sYiChCo)

>> **/u/CaptainCupcakez** There are drills in this game? No wonder it's taking me so long to complete heists...    
>> **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Far too many times.    
>> **/u/KingSpyCrab** u cant do thermal drol in shadoh reid

>> **/u/Szkieletor** Here's the deal with the drill: the first 500 times Bain reminds you, it's annoying. Later, you don't even hear it. You filter it out. Then you realize it's been 30 minutes into Bank Heist and the drill's still on the truck.

># [What cocksuckin' mutha'fooker measured the C4?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G78CMTqZhB8&feature=youtu.be&t=2m43s)

>> **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Wolf is the technician, blame him.    
>>**/u/Szkieletor** Houston's reaction is pretty telling. Wolf's fault for giving the C4 to the intern.

**5,300** people *looking at hardware gore* for  **4 Years!** 

/r/HardwareGore is the sister subreddit to /r/softwaregore. Whereas /r/softwaregore focuses on software fails and malfunctions, /r/hardwaregore is centered around problems related to hardware. 


This covers a wide variety of content, the submission may be a [fault caused by hardware issues such as a faulty GPU](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7ylmzp/my_laptop_screens_dying/), or it may be damage to [the hardware itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/8ivivd/coffee_spilled_on_a_gpu/), as long as there's hardware, and there's gore it's accepted. The subreddit has had numerous popular submissions, with the most popular being [some food found inside a computer system](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7vi72l/we_opened_up_a_school_computer_to_see_what_was/), and a [classic, retro battle station](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7x4ex8/this_is_what_my_friend_actually_uses/).

As a mod there, I thought it would be a good idea to conduct an interview, so I posed the following questions to the moderators. ~~Because I don't have friends~~ I've provided my own answers to the question as some bonus reading material!

>#What do you like most about the subreddit?

>>**/u/Occlpv2**  Probably my favourite type of content here is the physical damage to objects, such as the aforementioned post with chips being found inside a computer system, or a GPU dipped in sauce. The more valuable the item, the funnier!

>>**/u/IwataFan** It’s a great resource for seeing all the different ways hardware fails us (or we fail it). It can be really funny to see all the ways people manage to mess hardware up. Plus, being damage-prone myself, I find many of the posts here very relatable.


>##What is the biggest challenge you think the subreddit faces?

>>**/u/IwataFan**  Our main priority right now is to help and grow the community, primarily by finding unique content. We are very excited about the future of r/HardwareGore, as it is growing fast!

>>**/u/Occlpv2**  Probably sustaining the recent growth we've had, and keeping the submission quality high and relevant to the subreddit. Generally subreddit quality and there subscriber count are inversely proportional after a certain point, so we're trying to be the exception to the rule.


>Speaking of growing fast, how do you feel about the recent growth?

>>**/u/IwataFan**  It has been very exciting for the community and for our team to see how fast the subreddit has grown! We are getting a lot of great content, which I think is drawing people in. Our hope is that, with more people being a part of the community, we will see more and more awesome posts, so the future is looking very bright for the subreddit!

>>**/u/Occlpv2**  Delighted! I'm glad so many people are enjoying our content.

**646 readers for 2 years!**

What started as a one-off game of Mafia/Werewolf in /r/slytherin moved to /r/HogwartsWerewolves so we could play again with the rest of /r/harrypotter. We expected to play a few strong games before interest fizzled and the sub died, but the love the players have for this game has kept our sub going strong for over two years now, and the schedule for future games is filled through a large portion of 2019. Signups go up in /r/HogwartsWerewolves on the 25th of every month, and games then split to take place in /r/hogwartswerewolvesA and /r/hogwartswerewolvesB to allow each game to implement its own imagery in CSS so that players can immerse themselves. Games begin with the start of the new month. They are designed to run for the duration of that month.

Though ""hogwarts"" is in our name, we've collected a rag-tag group of players through various themes being advertised on their respective subreddits (/r/survivor, /r/fivenightsatfreddys, /r/themagicians, /r/thelastairbender, etc). Many of us have nothing in common other than our love of this strategy game. 

The game is intense. Tempers run high. The subreddit consumes you when you're up for elimination, and many of us have worn out our F5 buttons. We've developed real life friendships over the grudge votes and the heat-of-the-moment arguments, but we are ALWAYS looking for more people to bring into the fray. HWW members pride themselves on their dedication to making newbies feel welcome and accepted, and most of the players hold themselves to a moral code that disallows them from eliminating a new player within the first few phases - provided that new player doesn't say anything *too* suspicious. 

We have an extensive [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/wiki/index) with an [archive of past games](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/wiki/pastgames), though I like to encourage new players to jump in blind. Learn by doing! Another good way to get a feel for our game/community would be to check out some of our meta/discussion threads. 

- [Here is our roundup of 2017 games](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/7kqcpi/the_2017_wolfie_awards/)

- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/7md2vb/discussion_thread_what_are_the_funniest_comments/) is a discussion on funniest comments during a game, which I feel shows the love we have for the game and each other

- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/7zrlnq/discussion_happy_birthday_werewolves_what_was/) players reminisce about their ""welcome to werewolf"" moment, which might be interesting if anyone is considering playing for the first time

- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/7f1u3k/discussion_thread_whose_playstyle_do_you_have_a/) is a discussion thread on playstyle crushes, which shows how personal we all can get

For those wanting to join, the signups for the games open today. Make sure to read the rules, read the mechanics of the games, and make sure you are able to participate every day of the month. The themes for June are Toontown (Game A) and Thesis Defense (Game B), Firsthand knowledge of themes is not necessary to play - it only affects any ""flavor text"" or stories the hosts want to tell in their daily posts.

*(This subreddit features content that not all readers may enjoy, if your views conflict with this content, then do not proceed farther in this article.)*

# /r/YiffComics

**17,059** artists and readers *yiffing it up* for **5 Years**. 

Welcome back to the corners of the internet where the 'sane' dare not tread. We've stumbled back into furry territory yet again. This time, we delve into /r/YiffComics. That's right, if you don't have a good enough time getting off to /r/Yiff, instead you can seek a tale (or tail, if you prefer), and chances are there has been a comic written about it. But, worry you not, I'm back to take out on a guided tour down the [storylines](https://www.reddit.com/r/yiffcomics/top/), and the subreddit that provides them willingly to any who travel them. 

There's nothing greater than the artists who dedicate themselves to their work, and for many, such as [Zummeng](https://www.reddit.com/r/yiffcomics/comments/7mi66m/wishes_by_zummeng_mf/) and [Jay Naylor](https://www.reddit.com/r/yiffcomics/comments/74joun/the_awakening_byjay_naylor_mf/) their passionate fanbase ends up contributing to the progress of their work, either profitably or perhaps with a story or two. When you are first greeted by the /r/YiffComics hot page though, you'll find that comics are next to non-existent now, because all the work is put into finding the comics, instead of actually posting them. But... the *top* page... oh ho ho. That's where the fur and fun times begin. You'll find your typical [sexual tension story](https://www.reddit.com/r/yiffcomics/comments/69jyq1/tidal_wave_by_demicoeur_mfmm/), maybe something a tad more risque and taboo, such as [tales of incest](https://www.reddit.com/r/yiffcomics/comments/3koocj/mf_monday_mornings_blackkitten/), or [partner sharing](https://www.reddit.com/r/yiffcomics/comments/69x970/share_share_alike_part_1_by_kadath_mff/) but there's rarely ever anything non-consensual. The comics are lovingly crafted, with lovers (and those who need fapping material) in mind.

Don't get me wrong, though. /r/YiffComics is an open place. It doesn't demonize any of the material that's posted there (though some patrons will openly criticize posts there from time to time). Instead, it explores the far reaches of the taboo world, delving where other more 'human' comics wouldn't. (Like, literally involving human characters. ~~Though I have to admit, I've seen those topics covered in human comics too...~~) This de-humanizing of the comics allows them to be enjoyed more freely, as you can relate to the storyline, if there even is one, without adding yourself or people like you into the art. You feel the emotion, but don't feel engrossed in it all. Instead, some feel grossed out. (A joke, haha.)

Either way, take some time to read up on new things. If normal porn and hentai isn't doing it for you, run by /r/YiffComics and see if you find anything that sparks your intrigue. Personally, I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. 

^(If you're into that sort of thing, anyway.)

**49,538** Belters, Earthers, and Martians *in orbit* for **4 years!**

*The Expanse* is a science fiction television series that airs on the only cable network that looks like a slang term for a sexually transmitted disease, Syfy. (You know which one I'm talking about.) The show is based on [a series of novels by James S. A. Corey](https://i.redd.it/tt9cmt6h7lz01.jpg) and is in its third season. 

>>It's based on a book series that takes itself seriously. It isn't trying to emulate some other blockbuster film or top tier show. The Expanse is a well-established book series with a clear vision, which lets the TV adaptation pull from all the material written so far. It's a densely packed show that treats the viewer with respect and rewards re-watching with its subtlety and vast world-building.


The world building is what drew me in, and I stayed for [accurate portrayals of science](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2016/01/19/the-expanse-and-gravity-beyond-the-equivalence-principle/#7e6b33113e01) that are usually not present in modern movies and television, multifasceted characters, and compelling political intrigue. Plus, you know, action. The show, hands down, [has the best space battles I've ever seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/7r16v2/spacedock_gives_the_expanse_the_1_spot_for_best/).  

>>The Expanse is special because no other book to TV adaptation, that I know of, has worked so closely with the authors from start to finish. The entire cast and crew are personally invested in bringing the story to life. The main cast does rehearsals in their time off on the weekends during production. The cast and crew are as devoted to the show as a traveling acting troupe would be. They do it for the love of the story.

So, what is this show all about?

It takes place in a future where mankind has colonized the Moon, Mars, various asteroids, and moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn. On Earth, we've continued down our current path of environmental destruction and have achieved a one-world government, overseen by the United Nations. Our colonies on Mars have declared independence. A cold war brewing between the two powers becomes hot after three seasons. Also, we've discovered a way to travel pretty fast. 

In the midst of all of this is the Belt. The inners (those living on Earth and Mars) rely on belter labor for resources. Life in the belt is hard where freshwater and common commodities, such as cheese, are scarce. 

If political tensions and eventual war are not enough, a new problem threatens to destroy all of humanity, which comes in the form of the protomolecule, an alien lifeform of unknown origin and intent that has the ability to repurpose biological and technological resources for its own designs. The few in power who initially knew of its existence attempted to weaponize it, making matters worse for all parties (of course). 

The show is sooo good that its current season has a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. 

It compares favorably to other popular shows in and outside of its genre. 

>>[It's comparable to] Battlestar Galactica, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and it's better than all three.

*The Expanse* does bring me back to 2003 when the reimaging of a childhood favorite of mine, *Battlestar Galactica*, appeared in the form of a three hour miniseries on the then-named Sci Fi Channel. *The Expanse* has the same gritty feel as the first few seasons of *BSG*. Just badass scifi in space with great storytelling. 

The *Game of Thrones* comparisons are unavoidable. Just as the Lannister, Stark, and Targaryen factions jockey for power, so do Earth, Mars, and the Belt. Like in *GoT*, *The Expanse* delivers the story from multiple points of view on all sides in an equally high stakes political game that even Littlefinger would appreciate. 

So, what makes /r/TheExpanse so great?

It's the community. The users, the mods, everyone. This is one subreddit where you don't just interact with fellow fans, but also with members of the crew who come visit to give detailed explanations on technical feats achieved on a TV budget and express their genuine gratitude to everyone who loves their work. The mods don't just procedurally remove spam and vulgarities, they are big fans who are members of the community, not just overlords. These are not an unheard of phenomena in the redditsphere, but they are undeniably ingredients that make for the best of the best fandom-based subreddits. 

Speaking of the users... You may have heard that Syfy announced its decision to cancel *The Expanse*. (It's been on the front page of reddit, like a lot.) This is honestly a tragedy for lovers of great television. Scientists and artists alike have vocally risien to the show's defence, including George R.R. Martin. 

I've seen fan campaigns to save shows in the past. I participated in the one for *Farscape* (it half-worked) and I remember when people sent nuts to CBS exes to get a second season for *Jericho* (it did work). 

These guys at /r/TheExpanse helped to organize funding [to get an airplane to fly a banner over Amazon headquarters](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8johao/airplane_banner_is_up_and_flying_over_amazon/) to push the company into picking up the show for a fourth season. That's a thing that happened. 

Yesterday, in under four hours, they helped to raise enough money for a publicity stunt to top even that one. [They're sending a model of one of the shows spaceships to space.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8l3xox/our_roci_is_going_to_space_fundraiser_for_4000/) That's a thing that's going to happen. 

Amazon is currently in talks to renew *The Expanse.*

It's unbelievable. I am so happy to be a fan of the show and a member of this community. 

Remember, the show is on **tonight**. Watch it live through in ways that count for ratings, like YouTube TV and HULU TV. Get a one week free trial. Buy the show on Amazon. DVR it. Watch it on Netflix.

**16,691** geniuses *circling the obvious* for **6 Months**

Got a question for ya, what's heavier: [A killogramme of steel, or a kilogramme of feathers?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH0hikcwjIA) The answer will surprisingly shock you. \*arrow points to both at the same time* \*the double sided arrow is circled for absolutely no reason at all*

Yeah, clickbait. It's everywhere. Thumbnails of articles or videos posted around the internet that have these stupid arrows or red circles that point to something that isn't even about the article or video's premise. You'll see them all over the place. Need some batteries on a hydraulic press? [They've done it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uselessredcircle/comments/8jz7tb/i_wonder_what_i_should_be_looking_at/) How about [circling the ENTIRE. FREAKING. TEXT BOX.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uselessredcircle/comments/8jfdbt/oh_phew_i_almost_didnt_see_that_text_there/) God, I hate those. Well, /r/UselessRedCircle is your place for all things red, circular and clickbaity. Here, you'll see the internet in all its glory, and all its stupidity, circling nonsense and not feeling sorry for it.

It's a fantastic sub to mock the use of these harmless little shapes, and the community is extremely friendly. Sometimes, you'll actually get a post that [triggers people to actually comment and do their part!](https://www.reddit.com/r/uselessredcircle/comments/78oh55/you_too_should_post_your_useless_red_circles_today/) Surprisingly, the sub was founded, and is still currently run by only one moderator. The man, the myth, the legend. /u/Teekeks. I came across him, and his sub [while browsing /r/GlobalOffensive of all things](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/8ho53q/someone_help_i_tried_to_reinstall_game_cant_fix_it/dylhhg8/) and I thought to myself, there's a happy guy.

>>**/u/Teekeks**: [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonononoyes/comments/78mtw1/that_save/dov74z5/) prompted me to create the sub. It was a spontaneous idea of ""hey, that sounds like fun, lets go for it""

>#Where do you believe Useless Red Circles are extremely prevalent?

>>**/u/Teekeks**: Useless red circles are extremely prevalent in YouTube thumbnails and video clips of the news. Although red arrows are a bit more dominant than red circles on YouTube.

>#Will I believe my eyes, the ten most random things useless red circles have been around? 😉😉👌👌💯💯✓✓

>#Will you be including any other colors in the Useless Circle Spectrum any time soon?

>>**/u/Teekeks**: The sub is pretty inclusive. We prefer red circles but also accept blue, yellow, orange, black, white, purple and any other colored circle. We even accept a red arrow from time to time.

I like /u/Teekeks. I like his subreddit. I think that we should put a [circle around this post in his honor.](https://imgur.com/a/lRqptRw)

# /r/Rainbow6

**368,633** operators *breaching and clearing* for **6 Years**

You've heard people mention Rainbow Six: Siege in passing on /r/Gaming. All your friends are playing it, and now you're wondering what the big fuss is about. So, where else to find out more about it than /r/Rainbow6? As the name implies, this is the subreddit for all things pertaining to the Rainbow Six series of games (and occasionally you'll see a book post there, but they're hyper rare). Fortunately the unfortunate fact remains, the subreddit is dominated by its most recent release [Rainbow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8gxocn/i_know_its_casual_but_its_the_best_thing_ive_done/) [Six:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8gyrlg/yeet_of_the_century/) [Siege](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8h1vzc/frost_trap_infographic/). But, that's not at all a bad thing. Like Counter-Strike, and [it's respective subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike), the new games saturate the sub until they're split off into their own sub, like /r/GlobalOffensive.

So, why peruse /r/Rainbow6 then, when it's all based on one saturated game? Because, silly, you do still see your occasional posts from [classic games](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/76slra/bank_was_in_rainbow_six_3_raven_shield/) appropriately flaired 'Legacy'. Because this game has left a lasting legacy on the community, and Ubisoft's new addition to it has definitely got the players wanting a new Rainbow Six adventure to delve into.

When I thought about the mark the Rainbow Six series had left on me, I thought about asking the moderators how the games affected them too. Only one managed to answer, and I wanted to thank /u/LordKeren for doing so.  

>#What is /r/Rainbow6? Can you give a brief synopsis of it? When did it form, and why?

>>**/u/LordKeren**: /r/Rainbow6 is subreddit for fans of R6 to discuss Rainbow Six: Siege as well as past favorites. It features news about the game, gameplay, tips, discussion, Developer AMAs, etc.. The subreddit was created six years ago, but the launch of Siege is when the sub started to massively expand.

>#The Rainbow Six series has had its ups and downs over the years, were their any stand out games for you?

>>**/u/LordKeren**: This varies by mod, but other than Siege (which we obviously all enjoy), Raven Shield, Vegas, and Vegas 2 are all highly standout games that we discuss amongst ourselves. For some mods, Siege is their first R6 game, while other have played most if not all of the entries.

>#Siege has become one of the most popular Rainbow Six games in the series, is there anything you'd recommend to people just getting into the game, and subreddit?

>>**/u/LordKeren**: I think the most important thing to understand about getting into Siege is accepting that there will always be more to learn. Even veteran players are constantly learning new things and getting better at the game as it continues to evolve. Siege can definitely be intimidating, but going into it and being willing to learn from mistakes will have you learning quickly.

>#Favorite operators?

>>**/u/LordKeren**: Grouchy moderators will be more likely to tell you about the operators we don't like, but consistent favorites are Twitch, Hibana, Mira, and Pulse. Of course, we have to love Tachanka as well or there would be riots.

>#Since the release of R6: Siege, the sub has basically developed itself as the de facto Rainbow Six: Siege subreddit. Is there any plans to maybe open up a /r/Rainbow6Classic sub for people who enjoyed the older titles?

>>**/u/LordKeren**: Honestly, it isn't something we've really discussed much. We'd like to see more legacy talk about the games and book, but we understand that Siege is a huge component of why a vast majority of people come to /r/Rainbow6-- we don't have plans for a spin off subreddit to discuss non-Siege R6 topics at the moment. Great question though, we might create some more pinned discussions about non-Siege topics.

**49,988** wand users for **2 Years!** 

&nbsp;

If you've read the comments of any Internet post ever, you know there are some obscure references that come up.  You may not get them all, but ones that shine like a *Lumos* spell in a dark forest tend to catch the eyes of those who know where to look for them.^See ^what ^I ^did ^there?  
&nbsp;

/r/UnexpectedHogwarts is for everyone who's ever finished the Harry Potter series in book or movie form and felt like they were left wanting more. Muggles everywhere loved the HP saga while simultaneously feeling sad that even if Hogwarts did exist, they still didn't get an owl on their 11th birthday.  Fans who have read the books or watched the films once, twice, or even seven times and felt like they should have been a part of this magical world - come to the Internet.  We can spot each other in the dark midst of Youtube replies, casually mentioned on Facebook, and even ironically posted in the comments of Reddit.  When you've exhausted those outlets, come to /r/UnexpectedHogwarts.  Join the ranks of other Muggles who fill the void left by JK Rowling's writing by seeking echoes of magic in their daily lives.

&nbsp;

The posts featured on this subreddit are mainly sneaky Hogwarts, HP, or magical references that regular people could overlook - or, as the sticky says: ""the instances where the World of Harry Potter come up as an analogy, joke or metaphor on other subreddits"".  
&nbsp;

Amusing and relatable instances such as [how trans people see themselves](https://imgur.com/41tMhAQ), [what happens when two of our beloved characters try to spice things up in the bedroom](https://imgur.com/c7nr3RS), and a [laugh-to-keep-from-crying reference to current politics](https://imgur.com/QUNgPu6).
&nbsp;

Moderator /u/asdf-user answered some of our questions about the subreddit.

>#1. Why did you join /u/UnexpectedHogwarts?  

>>As a big Harry Potter fan I subscribed when I hear about the sub. When they were looking fir new mods I applied, because I thought it'd be cool to moderate an HP-related sub, and I quite enjoyed browsing it.

>#2. What's it like to moderate the sub?

>>Usually pretty chill. It's not a big/busy sub, so it's mostly flaring stuff.

>#3. What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>>I don't have any links to provide, but my favourites are when HP comes up in an unrelated thread (usually r/askreddit but could be anywhere on reddit) and the replies play along and you get this big comment-chain talking about the Potter universe.

Sometimes conference presentations will detail a medical breakthrough months before the study is formally published. Pre-prints are becoming more and more common, as researchers look for open-sources ways to quickly and easily share their data with the community. Sometimes, one good figure can communicate more than a thousand words.

Unfortunately, some of the largest science-themed subreddits have strict limitations on content type that prevent exciting, new science from being discussed.

r/sciences hopes to change that! We believe it has the potential to become a premier destination for discussing all types of scientific reports and news events on Reddit. The same scientific rigor as some of the larger subreddits, but much more flexibility for users in identifying impactful science and deciding how they share it with the community.

Some exciting content from the past week has included s exciting content like [a video of a patient with an inherited form of blindness before and after gene therapy](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/8c90l1/heralded_as_the_first_true_fdaapproved_gene/) or [this - a video of CRISPR in action](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/8c8xw8/singlemolecule_movie_of_dna_search_and_cleavage/) - content not allowed on other large science-themed subreddits. Other exciting posts have included [the FDA briefing documents as it prepares to consider approving a cannabinoid based drug](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/8cw86k/the_fda_is_holding_a_meeting_to_consider/) and [a study on the strange mating habits of the brown widow spider](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/8e79t0/for_brown_widow_spiders_sex_is_literally_a_matter/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=sciences).

/r/FlairWars is a growing subreddit that features users posting [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/flairwars/comments/8fdkyo/this_sub_in_a_nutshell/), [text posts for and against colors](https://www.reddit.com/r/flairwars/comments/8fbxy4/all_colors_are_equal_we_should_stop_the_war/), [and users actively trying to make the community better](https://www.reddit.com/r/flairwars/comments/8ev00y/multiple_accts/). The main subreddit is used as a sort of community meeting where the separate factions only talk about how their team is superior to all the other teams. Colors can also rally and attack other flair's own separate subreddits by raiding. Note the bloody [Lime Raid](https://www.reddit.com/r/InTheRed/comments/8f5idv/when_life_gives_you_lemons_ask_for_a_refund_and/) the Great Coolness Pact (Green, Blue, Purple) launched against Red. Users are able to join their team's partner subreddit and discuss war plans. The largest event that has occurred was the ROY and GCP alliances. ROY started after [Red joined Yellow and Orange's existing alliance, the YellOrange Alliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/flairwars/comments/8em570/praise_ra_roy_alliance_reigns_under_the_eternal/). [The Great Coolness Pact was forged](https://www.reddit.com/r/flairwars/comments/8enjqy/the_great_coolness_pact_has_been_forged/) soon after to combat this surprise alliance. Even though the community is only several weeks old, it already has history. It's exciting what other events will occur between the rivaling colors.

We have biweekly competitions that determine the header color for the subreddit. Our last battle was a simple [poll to see the most active team](https://www.reddit.com/r/flairwars/comments/8eoezy/vote_for_your_team_team_with_highest_vote_by/). All teams rallied their troops to claim the header, but [Orange managed to plant their fruity color at the top of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/flairwars/comments/8f3kaj/in_honor_of_oranges_spectacular_victory_in_the/). Future competitions will have fiercer battles and even higher stakes.

Remember the clash between [Orangered and Periwinkle](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2jne44/what_was_the_great_orangeredperiwinkle_clash_of/)? The idea is similar, except it didn't happen in 2013. It's happening now and your future team needs your help. We want to be as accepting as possible, so don't hesitate to bring your suggestions and ideas to the table! 

Since the community is still small, with just under 400 members, we hope to grow into a lively and exciting part of Reddit.

Remember that one game called PUBG? Neither do we. Too distracted, and it's none other than **Fornite: Battle Royale** that has us all talking. Battle Royale is a Free-to-play game mode released in October 2017 by developer Epic Games. Amongst many competitors, this mode has caused the video gaming world as a whole to be taken by **storm** (see what I did there?).

/r/FortNiteBR is every Fortnite players space to share their latest awesome kills, skin/emote concepts, quality memes and everything in between. Epic Games frequent the subreddit in order to offer real, honest support to their players and are always open to suggestions. The latest news, I could go on. Basically, if you're into Fortnite, this community is **the** place for you. 

---

**Below are some comments from the Moderators of /r/FortNiteBR:**

>**Why did you join the /r/FortNiteBR team?**

>>**/u/FinallyRage**: A few of us /r/Fortnite and /r/Paragaon (F) created the sub when we heard about the new game mode. Being a mod on the other Fortnite sub, we thought this would be the best since both games play so differently.

>>**/u/BurlsteinBurl**: Was a mod on normal /r/Fortnite. Loved the game so much and hopped aboard this sub to continue the community involvement. THe 2 game modes are very different.

>>**/u/MCiLuZiioNz**: I was already a moderator on /r/Paragon (RIP), doing a lot of CSS stuff. I had made some friends at Epic Games, and I remember one night I received a message saying, ""Hey, you're under NDA for the next 24 hours. We need help making a new subreddit for our new battle royale mode."" I had no clue how big the subreddit would get.

>**What do you find most gratifying about working with this community?**

>>**/u/FinallyRage**: We have a great community here and there's a huge desire to help each other. We're always getting tip/trick and weekly challenge help posts. We're always looking into how we can highlight these kinds of kill building posts.

>>**/u/BurlsteinBurl**: I really love the really sick plays and funny wholesome moments people post.

>>**/u/MCiLuZiioNz**: Working with the developers and the community to build a common platform where everyone can speak their minds is extremely fun to be a part of. So much great content and so many great suggestions have spawned from the subreddit.

>**Do you have any favourite submissions?**

>>**/u/FinallyRage**: I love the creativity people find with the new patches like **[rocket riding](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88bmt2/rocket_rode_myself_with_new_launcher_and_won_the/)** Contrary to popular belief, we mods do love a good **[Fortnite meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/84h1go/new_glider_concept_no_glider_at_all_you_just_hit/)**
 
>>**/u/BurlsteinBurl**: **[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7p7v9t/this_guy_broke_the_fourth_wall_to_say_hello/)** and **[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8avh0p/i_opened_the_rocket_riding_flood_gates_your_move/)**.

>**What are your hopes for the future of /r/FortNiteBR ?**

>>**/u/FinallyRage**: We are on track to pass up another battle royal sub in the next week or so and that's pretty exciting. We have some fun plans for this summer we're working on; hopefully they will be cemented soon so we can post about them.
 
>>**/u/BurlsteinBurl**: To continue to evolve into a place that has interests for everyone, from clips to discussions to everything in between

>>**/u/MCiLuZiioNz**: As someone who mainly does behind the scenes work now (bot stuff and team decisions), I really hope we can make things as efficient as possible in the near future. The amount of traffic we get is a never ending flood!

>**Anything else to add?**

>>**/u/FinallyRage**: **N/A**
 
>>**/u/BurlsteinBurl**: Excited for the future of both the game and sub!

>>**/u/MCiLuZiioNz**: The next couple of months are going to be crucial in the life of Fortnite, I hope I can just be there to help push it along in any way I can.

We couldn't avoid this one forever, I suppose. Not during Nintendo week. Oh, what's that? It's not a week? Well fuck you, we can't call it Nintendo Fortnight anymore, because that word was ruined. Also it sounds stupid. Anyways, let's continue.


&nbsp;



/r/Breath_Of_The_Wild is a subreddit that is filled with fans of the game, the Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. This game came out in March of 2017, for the Nintendo Switch and the Wii U. It received massive success upon its release, and quickly became one of the largest selling Zelda games, winning multiple awards and receiving high reviews from everywhere. Before we talk about the sub (and believe me, there's a lot to talk about), I'm going to talk about the game. Because it needs to be talked about. The game is astounding.


&nbsp;



The Legend Of Zelda has always been a franchise that's on the forefront of innovation. It revolutionised the adventure genre of games with [The Legend Of Zelda (NES)] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)), [A Link To The Past] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past) showed the capabilities of the SNES and created many of the series' long standing elements, [Ocarina Of Time] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time) was the pinnacle of 3D gaming at the time, and is still widely called one of the greatest games if all time, and [Twilight Princess] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess) ... added... Motion controls. They can't all be winners, I suppose. ^(jk Twilight Princess is my 2nd favourite Zelda game)


So, what did Breath Of The Wild do that the rest of the games didn't do? How did it manage to sell almost 4 million copies in its first month? How did it manage to almost singlehandedly make the Nintendo Switch become Nintendo's best selling console since the Wii?


Here's how: **It broke the fucking mold, and became one of the single greatest games of all time in doing so.**



&nbsp;


I can't praise this game enough. It would be a disservice to the game, to try and lay it all how here in this feature. No, I recommend everybody here try it out. Even if you don't know shit about the series, *try this game*. You won't regret it. The soundtrack is fucking glorious, one of the best in the series. The graphics are beautiful, and the locations are no different. The story is amazing, and the gameplay itself is one of the best in Zelda yet. But I'll try, *just a little.*


First, the music. It's simply amazing. The composers for this game outdid themselves here. Not only are they good video game soundtracks, they're just good pieces as a whole. Many of the pieces are simple, yet extremely effective ambient works that don't distract you from the gameplay at all. But the range found in the tracks is massive, you go from [serene and beautiful] (https://youtu.be/Nf-OSg1lkQw) to [ambient and calming] (https://youtu.be/Gk8sq59TZkU) (note that in-game it's a lot more dynamic, but you can't do that in a YouTube video), to [wait oh god what the fuck is going on oh Hylia what the fuck what tHE FUCK AH SHIT RUN RUN RU-] (https://youtu.be/MLOid6eCwFM)



You... Get the picture. The score is madly diverse, but every bit if it is great. There's no ""bad song"" in this game.


The gameplay is rather unlikely anything seen in Zelda before. The main difference being that this game is open world. When you play through this game, you'll be getting sidequests up the ass no matter where you are. There is so much to do, that you'll never not have something to do. Unlike in most other Zelda games, where there's a main questline and 8 or 9 different sidequests, and lieelt postgame, this game is more akin to, say, TES V: Skyrim, as you never finish the main questline and instead spend your time fucking with the physics and doing random quests for people, that you don't even need the reward for. It's a very different style to what is normally found in Zelda, and they did it wonderfully. Plus (this may count as a minor spoiler, warning), from the very start if the game, after leaving the tutorial area (which doesn't feel like a tutorial area, don't worry), you can literally just run straight to the final boss, and beat it. You'd need a fuck load of shitty weapons (weapons break), luck, stupidity, and mad skills, but it's doable. Most of the main storyline is spent preparing for the final boss, and making sure that your average player (you) can beat it. It's **that** sandbox.




The game is beautiful. There's not much to say here. The graphics are gorgeous, the lighting is perfect, there's atmosphere everywhere, and you'll just have fun going round the map, looking at shit ~~and trying to find that last fucking Korok~~. Nothing else to say here.




Now, I'm sure you get the picture. Actually, no you don't. The only way to get the full picture is to play the game. And I can't recommend it enough. Nor can the people of r/Breath_Of_The_Wild ^(well that took long enough to get to) .



If you haven't worked out what r/breath_of_the_wild is about, feel free to reread this post many times as necessary until you have. There's all sorts of stuff on the sub: [there are many helpful guides on how to do cool things] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/631je4/guide_fastest_dragon_horn_farming_3_per_minute/?utm_term=90d13b4e-f886-4933-8d28-a42957d6f089&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Breath_of_the_Wild&utm_content=6), [people breaking the physics] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/88kqst/i_tried_seeing_if_you_can_catch_a_boomerang_in/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Breath_of_the_Wild) ([because those physics can be broken, a *lot*] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/89uxbm/this_is_without_a_doubt_the_hardest_shrine/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Breath_of_the_Wild)),  there's plenty of [beautiful artwork]  (https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/65je7g/the_beginning_of_a_legend_by_rabbit_machine/?utm_term=3ee32de8-05db-4eb7-b8de-d6fec285a668&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Breath_of_the_Wild&utm_content=23) and [drawings] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/7los1m/i_finished_my_botw_map/?utm_term=3ee32de8-05db-4eb7-b8de-d6fec285a668&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Breath_of_the_Wild&utm_content=3). And, of course, there are [memes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/837nww/a_horrifying_look_at_deforestation/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Breath_of_the_Wild), the lifeblood of any good subreddit. There's a lot to see and do in /r/Breath_Of_The_Wild, just like in the game itself. The community is wonderful, and are always willing to be helpful to new players. Can't kill a Lynel? They've got you. Need to find that last damn Korok? This is the place to go.







&nbsp;


> **1:  Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>> **/u/Eiriksen** I was the first person to register /r/breathofthewild right as the E3 reveal happened. And we ended up merging with the current sub. In retrospect we should probably have stuck with the other name.

>> **/u/Lootman** We went with the /r/breath_of_the_wild name because at the time they had more subscribers, I don't mind having the underscore name because this one comes up first when searching for the sub anyway. Although at least 2 people have messaged the old subreddit asking if they can post, and that sub gets 10-20 subs a day with 400 page views. No idea what they're coming back for because the sub has been closed for a year.






> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/Eiriksen** Due to our wholesome community and lenient rules, little moderation is needed. An average day moderating /r/breath_of_the_wild is approving high rated posts that have been reported, and banning the occasional very rude person.

>> **/u/Lootman** I've commented on the automod page ""Automod is the best mod"". It works 24/7 and tells me everything it does.






> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **/u/Eiriksen** My favorite posts are the crazy gameplay clips people manage to pull off. One that comes to mind is this recent one https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/89uxbm/this_is_without_a_doubt_the_hardest_shrine/

>> **/u/Lootman** I really like this [post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/7pf64j/the_legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_discord/) because not only is the person who posted it really cool, it's also an important message.





> **4: This game is an excellent game, everybody can agree on that. However, do you believe it is a good Zelda game?**

>> **/u/Eiriksen** I have an unfathomable bias for main title Zelda games and can say no bad about this game.


>> **/u/Lootman** My favourite Zelda game is Darksiders II. Breath of the Wild is my favourite Elder Scrolls game though.





> **5: What are some of your favourite things to do in this game?**

>> **/u/Eiriksen** I love playing the early game when you are ill equiped, it's at that point you are most incentivised to find tricky ways to kill the enemies, rather than running in with your savage lynel crusher with 130 attack and Urbosa's Fury them. I also loved playing through Trial of the Sword on both normal and master mode.

>> **/u/Lootman** My favourite thing is just the game being free and open. The first thing I did right after the introduction's landscape zoom out was jump off the cliff and die. Just to see if the game would let me, and it did! That kind of freedom in a game where you aren't restricted to a path is amazing. In most games if you tried jumping off that cliff there'd be an invisible wall or the game would just put you in a protective bubble and lift you back on.







> **6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**


>> **/u/Eiriksen** Weekly Discussion #10 - The Bolson Construction Homes

>> **/u/Lootman** Weekly Discussion #11 - The Bolson Construction's Guidelines






> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/Eiriksen** Shoutout to the subreddits active discord community for not making life too hard on me (and the discord mods for being the best ever), and Manechat for great advice on how I should braid my in game horse's mane.

>> **/u/Lootman** I need suggestions for good Xbox 360 games because my 360 shelf has a gap the size of 5 games that I want to fill





&nbsp;


Games often come and go, and are only popular for a short time; it's normal in the industry. But I think Breath Of the Wild is going to be relevant for a very long time.

####/r/The_Dedede

###1,873 cappies wanting to clobber Kirby for two months.

---

Guess who it is? Guess again. WRONG. It's his glorious and incredible majesty King Dedede. Let me ask you something. Who's the strongest superhero in the world? I'll give you a few questions. If you answered Crooked Kirby, you're bad and you should feel bad because the correct answer is King Dedede VI, the sixth king of Cappytown, home to the cappies. 

/r/The_Dedede's ultimate goal is the clobber ~~Hitler~~ Crooked Kirby, a known criminal who SHOULD be charged with serial homocide, destroying corporate theft, identity theft, and various other crimes. He's mindlessly accepted by Cappytown's citizens, who only see him for his ability to perform basic human functions and not for the various crimes he's committed. Join our sub today in our quest to frame him for everything he's done.

I've some questions though, and the mods got answers.

Q: Why?

A: Too many times is His Majesty seen as the ""bad guy"". People often focus on the negatives of what he does, and not the positive side to it. For example: a few years back Dedede decided to collect food from Dreamland to bring to the starving children in Africa. He collected donations from all the citizens of Dreamland. But Kirby didn't see it that way. He thought he was stealing it, and so he essentially murdered Dedede and lifted his entire castle all the way back to town, so that all the food would drop down. And of course nobody sees anything wrong with this, they just accept Kirby as the good guy, no matter what. It's outrageous! It's unfair!

Q: What are your most favourite posts?

A: All posts that have His Great Glorious Majesty in them.

We started on the Switch's first anniversary on March 3rd 2018. Since the German-speaking reddit community in comparison is rather small we initially aimed to gain 100 subscribers by the end of March. In the meanwhile we had our first AMA with the well-known German indie developer Pixel Maniacs (known for ChromaGun) from Nuremberg with many more upcoming AMAs with people, publishers and studios from the German games industry already in the pipeline. We do tournaments with the community as well. Our first one was about Mario Kart 8 DX which we held in conjunction with the famous German YouTube Let's Player m00sician. Last but not least we have a cooperation with Germanys last Nintendo print magazine, N-ZONE.

Most importantly though we already have a great and steadily growing community which contributes with discussions, questions, fan-art and much more every day. We're inviting every German-speaking Nintendo Switch fan (we love to call them Believer) to join us!

We're /r/NintendoSwitchDE. The German-speaking community about all news, updates, rumors and topics about the Nintendo Switch. By fans for fans. 100% Nintendo. 100% independent.

**Interview:** 

>How do you feel about Nintendo in recent days, do you think they changed their tactics?

>>/u/The_4th_Survivor: I don't think they inherently changed. They don't even know how they got so successful with the Switch in the first place. But that's the reason people love Nintendo. Because they are quirky and different. And this time around, they got the marketing right.

>>/u/Dscheikob: Nintendo has always been a company with an unique approach to consoles and gaming in general. Whilst other Manufacturers focused on releasing strong hardware, that can run Games on high resolutions or with a steady 60 FPS, Nintendo created unique Gameplay-experiences with the Motion-Controls on Wii or the soon available Nintendo Labo. Sometimes this approach turns out to be a stroke of genius, as it did with the afore mentioned Wii, sometimes it turns out to be failure, as it did with the Wii's successor.
As for the recent days I'm surprised with how good Labo turned out to be, the Toy-Con Garage is a great feature and I can't wait to see all the cool ideas people will come up with.

>>/u/Felensis: I feel great about Nintendo in general as well as a fan since my early childhood days. While the Wii U era was a huge disappointment even though it got some decent games I think Nintendo did an outstanding job with the Switch. They literally flipped the whole company, their image and their marketing upside-down. It was a huge bet, but I'm happy it paid out for them. The Switch is simply the most awesome console out there. Especially if you have a full-time job and/or wife & kids. I love it!

>>/u/404IdentityNotFound: Compared to the GBA/GBmicro era, Nintendo has been back with it's witty humor and bold marketing strategy. Compared to the Wii/WiiU era, they dropped their ""let's use children to symbolize that our products are for everyone"" mentality. That's great and the right way to advertise to the main target group. I also think Nintendo learned a lot from the WiiU era, especially since they try to distribute game releases over a year now instead of bundling 3 big titles and going silence for multiple months.

>If you could choose one game, software- or firmware update that Nintendo would publish, what would it be and why?

>>/u/The_4th_Survivor: That's a tough one. I have lot's of wishes for potential releases but if this is a fairy fountain question, I don't want to waste any wishes. I think the game I want the most, is a Golden Sun Remaster/Remake. Not with 3D graphics though. Either with lovely 2D sprite work, the first two entries on GBA had or something similar to VanillaWare's art style.

>>/u/Dscheikob: My most desired Software-Release for the Switch is Virtual Console. There are just too many gems that have been released on older Consoles that I never got to play and sadly, I neither own a Wii U or a 3DS where VC is available.

>>/u/Felensis: I would choose a huge firmware update which integrates messaging, voice- and partychat on a system level as well as bringing essential functions like savegame backups and folders.

>>/u/404IdentityNotFound: GAME: Animal Crossing - c'mon, this E3!
SOFTWARE: Flipnote - it was the YouTube before I knew what YouTube was!
FIRMWARE: Forget about a browser, achievements or save game backup! I want to export my videos and screenshots to my pc or mobile device!

>What's your most favorite Nintendo game and what is your most favorite Nintendo console?

>>/u/The_4th_Survivor: The GameCube. Lots of the Switch design aspects remind me of the little turd. I mean, how cute is a console with a handle? Now flatten it, put a screen on it and they aren't that different, are they? You can carry both with you around, so, check mate to those who disagree.

>>And my favorite game has to be Ocarina of Time. It seems total cliche, but the 10y/o me was totally blown away by this game. Even after finishing it, I spent lot's of time in Hyrule, especially fishing. First) because my allowance wasn't that much to afford additional games and second) as a coping mechanism when I lost my grandpa a few years later.

>>/u/Dscheikob: GameBoy Color and Pokémon Crystal. I got a GameBoy Color as a christmas present and the first game I've bought myself was Pokémon Silver. The reason for that I chose Crystal over Silver is because I actually managed to sink more than 200 hours into that game, even though my parents always made sure I wouldn't spend an entire day playing video games.

>>/u/Felensis: My favorite Nintendo console is the Switch even though I had them all and started with the NES and Game Boy back in the days.
My most favorite game, huh? That is a difficult question because there are just so many out there. For a long time this would be Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or one of my favorite SNES games - but Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece and it deserves to be my new all-time favorite!

>>/u/404IdentityNotFound: Considering that I never grew up with a N64, NES or SNES (my parent's were super into PlayStation and PC back then) I'd say my favourite console besides the Switch would be the NDS(i), as I had many childhood memories with that console. Game wise, I've lately noticed that Super Mario Odyssey could be pretty high in the list of my top Nintendo games. Besides that, I'd say Super Mario Maker was a very huge title for me.

>What are your most favorite posts on the subreddit?

>>/u/The_4th_Survivor: My favorite posts are news related. /u/Dscheikob and /u/manasamus as well as /u/Felensis do an awesome job with their regular posts about all things switch. I wouldn't be as informed as I am without them. Kudos to you guys! 

>>/u/Dscheikob: We publish a summary of all the Switch related news and announcements every day, which I think is a great service for everyone who wants to stay up to date with the system and upcoming releases without having to actively look for them.

>>/u/Felensis: There are a lot of great discussions, questions and posts, but if I have to pick then it would be our first AMA with Pixel Maniacs, a indie developer from Nuremberg (https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendoswitchde/comments/87rqr0/hey_leute_chromagun_ist_endlich_auf_der_switch_zu/) and second a discussion about which bad games our users have played while thoroughly enjoying them (https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendoswitchde/comments/84tzxr/nennt_spiele_die_euch_gefallen_allgemein_jedoch/)

>>/u/404IdentityNotFound: I loved the last AMA we had with the PixelManiacs, the developers of ChromeGun. It was one of the few AMA's where I constantly came up with new questions, and the developers were very nice.

There's a ton of fighting games out there. Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, Brawlhalla, about 1000 others that nobody really cares about. But on Nintendo, there isn't much choice. You have Super Smash Bros, and that's it. But really, SSB is all you need, as it's one of the best fighting games out there.



There are 4 games in the series: [Super Smash Bros] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._(video_game)) for the N64; [Super Smash Bros Melee] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee) for the GameCube (AKA: The best one); [Super Smash Bros Brawl] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl) for the Wii; and [Super Smash Bros for the Wii U and 3DS] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._for_Nintendo_3DS_and_Wii_U), which you've probably worked out already. Additionally, there will be a """"""""""""port"""""""""" of the Wii U version coming out for the Switch. 


Now with all the boring shit out of the way, let's get to the game ^(and also the subreddit, I suppose) .


&nbsp;


Smash Bros is one of Nintendo's flagship franchises. In fact, it's all its flagship franchises compressed in to one franchise, because in the games, you play as various Nintendo characters. Naturally, this answers some of our childhoods' untimatums: Could Link beat Luigi in a fight? What if Link was hit by a Falcon Punch, and would he die? The answer to both of those is ""if  you wavedash enough, *probably*"". But it raises as many questions as it answers. If Kirby eats one of Fox's laser projectiles, does he gain the powers of the laser? Or does he become a massless particle moving at 299,792,458m/s? How would Mario react to being hit by Pikachu's Thunderbolt? Would he shrink? Unfortunately, neither of those are answered in the games. But we can hope that maybe they'll he answered in the """"""""""port"""""""""".



However, it's not limited to just Nintendo characters, there are characters from other companies as well! You have Snake, from the Metal Gear series, Sonic, from... You know, Cloud from Final Fantasy 7, and the new """"""""""port"""""""""" is going to have many more characters foreign to Nintendo, such as Jimmy Neutron, and possibly even Tony the Tiger (from Cereal). In short, the games have a vast array of characters, all of which have different attacks and special attacks, and they allow you to choose between a large amount of playstyles (or you can just play Meta Knight all the time regardless of the situation and be that person nobody likes).



Personally, I've always been a Toon Link main. He's like Link, but, you know, smaller. Objectively worse than Link? Maybe a tiny bit, but he's still fun to play, because I'm good with him. For the most part, unless you're playing competitively, there's no ""bad"" characters, only bad players. And even in competitive play, a good player playing with a shitty character could beat a less good player. The game, despite all its customisation and expansive set of characters, manages to be extremely balanced and no character has any massive advantage over any other in casual play (again, competitive is different, but that's an entirely different landscape).




And that's only the characters we've talked about so far. What about the gameplay?

Well, there's a lot to cover over the 4 games. Every game is, at it's heart, a fighting game. In matches, your goal is to kill the enemy. Simple enough, right? But there's ***soooooo*** much there to do. The games have a massive amount of items, all with different effects, and that drop randomly throughout the match. You have banana peels, hammers, golden hammers, the Super Scope (yes, the SNES accessory), a Star, Dragoon, and so, so many more. There's the Assist trophy, which can temporarily summon a character from a Nintendo game to aid you in your quest of wiping the other character off the face of the stage; and depending on the game, there's many, many different options. There's a Pokeball, which is functionally the same as the Assist Trophy, but, well, Pokémon. And then there's everyone's favourite Smash Ball, which allows the character to perform a special, massively powerful Final Smash to eradicate anyone who got too close.


The third game in the series, Brawl, even contained a story mode, the Subspace Emissary, which had levels, special enemies, a story, and a final boss (a fucking difficult one at that). Even outside of that, there are many, *many* different things to do: minigames,  boss rushes, the rather difficult 100 Man Brawl, and the ""Classic"" mode, where you go through and beat a number of stages that generally consist of killing a moderately tough normal AI enemy, before reaching the final boss.


One of the most unique parts of this game is the damage system. While it's been ripped off my many games since, it was rather revolutionary for its time. Instead of you having a certain number of hit points, you have a percentage, that starts at 0. Upon getting hit, this percentage will go up, the amount being dependent on the attack itself. The higher this percentage, the higher you get knocked back by attacks. You die when you get knocked out of the screen. This allows for a much more strategic playstyle than just ""run in and punch the shit out of the other guy"" (though that's generally a half decent strat), as you have to factor in where on the stage you are, how much damage you have, whether the opponent has enough damage to get knocked out of the stage, and more.




&nbsp;




Now, that's the main game talked about. Let's finally move onto the community itself. /r/Smashbros is the best place to go if you're a fan of the games. It's filled with players new and old, there's competitive players and tournaments, casual players, cool fan art, and helpful strats to aid you in fucking up your friend. The community is just wonderful, and they're always ready to help a newcomer. The game has a massive competitive scene, and you'll find information all about it here, whether it's tournaments, your local scene, or the things happening at that moment. If you are interested in Smash I would recommend subscribing to this sub, it's charm and uniqueness cannot be understated.





&nbsp;


> **1:  Why/how did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** I had been posting in the subreddit since the around 2013, which was when Smash 4 was announced and the hype train for that got rolling. When moderator applications opened up in early 2016 I realized that I liked both Smash Bros and Reddit, so I went for it. I had no idea what I was getting into, but it’s been interesting and I don’t regret it at all.



>> **/u/Abraman1** /r/smashbros was actually the first subreddit I subscribed to. I was watching a Smash Bros stream and the streamer plugged their reddit post, and I thought ""now's as good a time as any to make a reddit account"" so now I'm here.

>> **/u/Qwexe** Honestly I don't know how I got here I think I came here just to meme and post power rankings.





> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** I’ve moderated other big subreddits before, and I can honestly say that moderating /r/smashbros is a completely different experience. It’s kinda like moderating two different subreddits.

 >> There’s the competitive side that’s always there. There isn’t much to post when a big tournament isn’t going on, though occasionally there’s drama that can’t be avoided like the brief period of time where a lot of /r/smashbros was pushing for a Bayonetta ban. During the big events, though, we do a lot of moderating with people making low effort posts and trying to make match posts before other people. Unfortunately, we also have to remove a lot of posts when people forget civility and lash out against players they don’t like. There are a lot of good eggs on the subreddit, though, and it’s always refreshing to see the same people being the voice of reason.

>> The casual side comes and goes with Smash-related news. There were almost no casual posts  before the Smash Switch announcement, but the subreddit really came alive when that happened. The activity was similar to a big subreddit for about a week or two, though it’s certainly died down a bit. There will definitely be resurgences after E3 and the game releasing.


>> **/u/Abraman1** It's pretty chill most days. The sub really kicks into gear during tournament weekends though, and I'm usually busy flairing posts, removing duplicate twitch clips, and making sure posts are spoiler tagged.

>> **/u/Qwexe** Modding here is mostly pretty chill I guess. Sometimes I'd call it annoying and frustrating but never really stressful which is nice cuz I get enough stress arguing with bitches on the internet.





> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** The first post I always think of is [the legend of /u/PeachProblem.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/2dcjtj/i_have_a_rather_embarrassing_problem_with_peach/) Other favorites:

>> - [Guy asks a question] (https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/2gbctz/hi_what_button_do_i_press_for_the_final_smash_in/)

>> - [This really cool video by a frequent poster] (https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/74arxk/i_reanimated_the_melee_intro_with_a_different_set/)

>> - [Celebrities playing Smash] (https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/5hs8vf/does_jack_black_playwatch_this_game/)

>> **/u/Abraman1** [This post] (https://redd.it/2gbctz/) is an absolute classic. This guy was asking a completely innocent question, and for some reason people decided to upvote the shit out of it. [Picture of Captain Falcon] (https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/29dcxo/picture_of_captain_falcon/) is also a notably good

>> **/u/Qwexe** Favourite posts all time are probably Drive-by Falcon, Free Form Jazz Melee and that one post where someone posted pics of my friends twitter and called him out for being a jim. Also every comment by /u/Luhmies.






> **4: Besides the characters, what you think differentiates Smash Bros from other fighting games? Why is it so much larger than other games in the genre?**

>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** Wow, that’s a great question. I could probably write an essay on that, but I’ll be as brief as I can.

>> Smash has mass appeal due to not only its legacy, but being very accessible. I still remember a cousin playing Brawl for the first time and noting how easy it was to pick up and play. On the other hand, fighting games like Street Fighter are insanely fun but have an execution barrier that a lot of casual players don’t bother to cross. My very casual brother bought Marvel vs Capcom 3 because he was a Marvel fan, but dropped it because he found it confusing. I think that’s unfortunate because I really love games like Third Strike and CvS2, but it’s the nature of the beast. Being able to play with up to 4 (now 8!) people also has a lot to do with it.

>> **/u/Abraman1** Well, Smash Bros is obviously different from other (real) fighting games in that its entire playstyle and win conditions are entirely different from other games. Instead of having both characters on a flat surface with guarenteed combos and health, Smash is more akin to sumo wrestling where the goal is to knock your opponent off the stage instead of whittle them down to 0. Combos are also less guarenteed because of DI, or directional influence, so I think the game is more neutral heavy than other fighting games. I think, as far as platform fighters go, Smash is the only one that really has a lot of polish, so it's the most successful. Many other games have tried to emulate smash but none of them have really had as much effort put into them. (Like seriously, take a break Sakurai before you work yourself to death.)

>> **/u/Qwexe** While I think there's a lot that obviously differentiates Smash gameplay wise from other FGCs, but I think the community we've built over the years and the passion that so many different people at so many different levels have for the game is what really makes it special and continually growing. Also just how easy the game is to get into and love casually.


> **5: Which Smash game is your favourite, and why?**

>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** Brawl will always be my favorite. It was the game I grew up with, had the most stuff to do, and also had Metaknight. You can also do lots of things with modding. I think I broke 10,000 matches played on my original file.

>> I think that Melee is objectively the best Smash game ever made, but playing a round of Brawl feels like coming home. You can’t beat that feeling.


>> **/u/Abraman1** My favorite Smash game is Project M! If you don't know what that is, it's a mod for Brawl that balances the game and adds in many mechanics (and a couple characters) from Melee. A lot of Melee players didn't like Brawl because it was floaty and more defensive, so they attempted to emulate Melee as best they could using Brawl's engine and characters. If you're interested in giving it a try, visit /r/SSBPM to learn more!

>> **/u/Qwexe** I think Project M is probably my favorite smash iteration. Even though it can be janky at times there are just so many characters that I actually enjoy playing and that variety, combined with how cool the community is, always brings me back with a smile.






> **6: Who's your main?** 



>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** >> Smash 64: I love Link. Something about the sounds and the hitlag when you hit them with your sword is just the best.

>> Melee: I jump between Marth, Falco, and Sheik. I am not good with any of them, but it’s still a blast to play.

>> Brawl: Metaknight until the day I die. He may be broken, but he’s also the most fun to play.

>> Smash 4: I jump around a lot, but when I was active in my local scene I was well known for playing Dark Pit and Samus.

>> **/u/Abraman1** In Project M, I play Charizard. In Melee I'm sort of drifting in between several characters trying to find who I like to play the best after quitting my old main, Sheik. I've mostly been playing Kirby in Melee tournaments recently, just to have a bit of fun.

>> **/u/Qwexe** My main in Smash 4 (the game I've played the most and am probably the relatively best at) is Mii Brawler. I love the way the character feels to play. Both his movement and combo game are just so fluid and open for creativity. My other mains are 64 Fox, Melee Kirby, Brawl/PM G&W and Smash Switch Steve from Minecraft.






> **7: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**


>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** I’m buckling down for when Smash Switch releases. There’s going to be a lot of shit going down and I think the mod team is going to have to step up big time.


>> **/u/Abraman1** Moving forward we'd like to continue to be a hub for the competitive Smash community on reddit. We're...still trying to figure out how to incorporate the characters from the new game as flairs though. (We've nearly run out of space in the CSS)


>> **/u/Qwexe** Moving forward in this next year, I want to make sure that resources are readily available to those future young smash switch players out there looking to improve and find competition. I want to try and promote to anyone loving the new game the amazing irl tournament space that already exists all over the globe so they can go out there and get involved as well.


> **8: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/TheRealMrWillis** Thanks to SOTD for having us! It’s an honor.

>> **/u/Abraman1** Hi mom


>> **/u/Qwexe** Follow me on Instagram and Twitter and YouTube and Reddit.

**887,304** trainers for **9 years**!




&nbsp;




I think it's safe to say that pretty much every single person born after 1970 has, at the very least, heard of Pokémon. It's one of the largest video game franchises to date, being one of Nintendo's flagship franchises. It has consistently remained relevant in the rapidly transforming landscape that is the video game industry, for over 20 years. Old people enjoy it, young people enjoy it, it's almost universal in the praise it gets.


And it deserves *all* of that praise, god damnit.


For those unaware of the Pokémon franchise, it's probably not healthy to sit in that cave all the time; people need their sunlight and social interaction. But I digress. you're probably wondering ""well, what the hell is this Pokerman thing and why is my grandson so obsessed with it, when he should be out getting a job?"" Well good sir, take your meds before your blood pressure gets too high, and let me explain. Anyways, he's, like, 9, come on, let him have his fun. The Pokémon series began with 2 games: Pokémon Red, and Pokémon Green. They were released for the Game Boy in Japan on February 27, 1996, with the rest of the world getting Pokémon Red and Blue later on, at varying dates. The games were rather different from the normal style of RPG at the time; Instead of collecting new loot and powering yourself up, you caught little* creatures called ""Pokémon"", and trained them up, until they could defeat other ""trainer's"" Pokémon. Instead of your equipment progressing at a pseudolinear rate (ie. You get stuff that's objectively better than the stuff you had before, but you *toootally* don't have to use it if you don't want to), you could build up your preferred style of team, with a full party consisting of 6 Pokémon, out of a whopping 152 (well, usually only 151 are accessible, but if you beat the Elite Four 50 times and push the truck for 10 minutes, you can unlock the superlegendary Mewthree, that's level 200 and has a move that instakills everything). This, along with a fuck ton of moves to teach to your Pokémon, gave players a staggering amount of options for teams. Even today, there is no objectively ""best"" team in the game's meta. You can get all level 100 dragon types with the best moves in the game, and they can be fucked up by a level 1 rattata holding a Focus Sash and spamming Endeavour and Quick Attack (no, seriously).

The games were a colossally massive success. This is going to sound a bit gatekeepy, but you really can't understand just how massive the Pokémon craze was unless you were around for it. It was fucking everywhere. Everybody was playing it. And keep in mind that Red and Blue (and green) were flawed as fuck. They were buggy messes. But the mere concept of it was enough to encapture a generation. Game Freak (the creators of the franchise, which I've forgotten to mention till now) knew they had to cash in on this craze. And cash in they did, with merchandise flooding the market, and everyone buying it. It was the most popular game of the era, even if you didn't play it, your friends did, and their friends did as well.

And so, a franchise was made. An anime was created, which is still going to this day (I honestly don't watch it so I'm not going to expand on it; this feature is long enough as it is). Spin off games were made. And of course, there were sequels, with Pokémon gold and Silver being released in 1999. These games improved on everything that the previous games had built up, and did so while adding so much more.



&nbsp;


Well, that was a lot to digest, wasn't it? and we barely covered 10% of the franchise's history. But this feature would be a fucking novel if we went through it all, and we haven't even started talking about /r/Pokemon ^(oh yeah, forgot that's what we did here) . So I'll end this chapter with this: Gen 4 is the best generation, the gen 4 spinoffs are better than any other spinoffs, and if you say otherwise, you're wrong and will be banned ^not ^really . And Gen 7 is overhyped, the pacing is bad, the characters are bland (looking at you, Hau), the hour long mash-A tutorial is inexcusable and I'm going to stop here before I bring down this sub singlehandedly.




&nbsp;




As the observant readers may have noticed, /r/Pokemon is a sub about... Pokémon. Surprising, I know. The sub is the best place to go for all your Pokémon news, help, discussion, and really, anything Pokémon related. The sub is filled with all sorts of posts, [arts] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/8g7i1p/thought_id_start_sharing_my_art_here/) and [crafts] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/857t3l/here_is_a_papercraft_petalburg_city_i_made_based/), [karmawhoring with a side of mod abuse] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/79zfjm/if_this_post_gets_32768_upvotes_before_the_end_of/), [guides] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/7t59mt/how_to_find_celebi_in_crystal_version_when_this/), [memes] (https://out.reddit.com/t3_80luyn?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FORL0Plo.gifv&token=AQAADf_tWhkDo9nAlR-fd4fZD1QKlQl0EdxhVpcVgPFRY86KEStU&app_name=reddit.com) ([lots] (http://i.imgur.com/9odcRZ5.gifv) [of] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/6tej6b/rip_poor_pikachu/) [memes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/89a2s6/any_fellow_artists_out_there/)), and so much more. It's truly an excellent sub, with a great community, lots of high quality posts, and lots of stuff for anyone wishing to get into Pokémon, and many more for people who are already Pokémon fans.






&nbsp;


> **1:  How did you become involved with the subreddit?**

>> **TexasAndroid** I'd been involved with the weekly questions threads for quite a while, and otherwise generally enjoying the sub. Then the sub did one of it's occasional mod recruitment drives. On something of a whim I went ahead and filled out an application. A month or two later I got the PM that I had been accepted onto the team. And the rest is history.


>> **Koni_Fox**  I had done some moderation on old-school forums back in 2007 or so and decided to get back into the community as a whole a little while before the previous generation. Applications opened and I was accepted somehow!


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **TexasAndroid** https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jNoCP6WEfO4hzDT2-wNk9hcMzb3iAWnz4VSqQMEmP10.png (Image taken from /r/BestOfReports)

>> **Will-TVR** Gotta agree with my colleague that it's [pretty much how this comic depicts it.](https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jNoCP6WEfO4hzDT2-wNk9hcMzb3iAWnz4VSqQMEmP10.png) It's fun some days, but other days it's like trying to put out a fire while people scream and throw gasoline on you.

>> **Draycen** Yeah Will and Texas pretty much nailed it already. This is a sub that hit the point where you can do no right, and you just gotta accept that. 

>> **RustRider** It's been said before but this. https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jNoCP6WEfO4hzDT2-wNk9hcMzb3iAWnz4VSqQMEmP10.png


>> **leaffyleif** A lot of fun. We have a great team and the discourse in our backroom is always good to be a part of. The team is respectful of one another and the social aspect is great. In terms of the sub and its users, it's a pretty thankless job at times but then you get some users that genuinely appreciate that we're just trying to look out for them and that makes it worth it.

>> **DavidLuizshair** It's good fun! I enjoy it a lot, even through the best of times and the difficult times. It's got a lot of fun stuffs and varied content.

>> **bigslothonmyface** Best sub on Reddit! Fantastic community driven by dedicated, super-talented OC contributors. Can be hilarious or genuine or helpful, and is almost always remarkably kind. Other subs/mods should be jealous of what we've got.

>> **Koni_Fox**  Our rule set is very well thought-out, but a lot of users don't appreciate the amount of time (and arguing) that goes into making a set of fair and accessible rules. Thankfully, we rarely have to deal with huge amounts of reposts, so most of my moderation time is spent ensuring new posts adhere to the rules, and addressing rude or otherwise distasteful comments.











> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **TexasAndroid** 

>> **Will-TVR** The ones that delve deep into secrets of the games, their tech, and their lore tend to be my favorites, as is cute fan art.

>> **Draycen** ~~My frogs~~ I'm a fanartist, so I personally love seeing the creative and colorful fanart that people post. I know it's a point of contention with a good portion of the users, but I think fanart as a whole is one of the best things this community has going for it

>> **RustRider** That one dude who promised to buy everyone who upvotes his post a copy of Pokemon SM. Also just anything that happens during our ""purge""

>> **leaffyleif** u/Draycen's froggie boyes and much of the art. Some really high quality art around these parts.

>> **DavidLuizshair** I don't think I have a particular favourite thread unfortunately.

>> **bigslothonmyface** My favorite regular thread is our Weekly Questions Thread, which gets hundreds of questions and answers every time and is constantly active and useful. I'm so proud of the people in there every time I look—it's led to us discovering future Best Of winners and a few excellent future mods as well! That thread shows the community at its best, IMO.


>> Otherwise, [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1u0kkv/in_pokemon_goldsilver_when_i_battle_whitney_and/) is my all-time favorite. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/73fwsp/todays_saturday_that_means_the_bugcatching/) is my favorite from the last year. I think those demonstrate the ridiculous diversity of good stuff the sub churns out.

>> I highly recommend checking out our [Best of 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/7ng5xq/best_of_2017_the_results/) results if you want to get a feel for things in general.

>> **Koni_Fox** Some of the fanart is amazing. I know users get tired of seeing tons of fanart, but during ""off-season"" when the newest games have been around for a while and there's no impending new title, the fanart is often the highest quality new content coming out of the community. I also really like some crazy fan theories and discussion posts.





> **4: What's your favourite generation (or game) and why?**

>> **TexasAndroid** 

>> **Will-TVR** I'll always like SoulSilver the best, I think. Silver was the first game in the series that I actually owned (I was a superfan since Red/Blue hit the US though!), and SoulSilver was what brought me back to the series after a nearly decade-long hiatus. The memories and emotions it brought back were very special.

>> **Draycen** I'm a gen 3 fanboy. It was where I started and I just can't get past my nostalgia for it. That being said, BW2 are actually my favorite games to replay. The Pokedex, region, and story make it the most enjoyable game overall.

>> **RustRider** Pokemon Diamond was like the first pokemon game where I really became involved with the intricacies of the series. Pokemon Yellow though has a special place in my heart as my first pokemon game.

>> **leaffyleif** In my view, Gen 6. I really enjoyed the transition to a fully-realised 3D world and I felt the story line to XY was great (+ ORAS wasn't bad either). Tied with that is Gen 4, I thoroughly enjoyed DPPt and I'm currently replaying those alongside XY.

>> **DavidLuizshair** Gen 2. I love Johto and going into Kanto afterwards. HG/SS and G/S/C was my favourite game growing up!

>> **bigslothonmyface** Gen 3 (Emerald specifically; R/S aren't nearly as good). Steven is bae. [Trick House represent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r59LYKB55eU)


>> **Koni_Fox** I loved Pokemon Crystal because it was the first game where I could be a female protagonist, and the novelty of animated sprites was just awe inspiring to me at the time. The remakes (SoulSilver, in my case) were wonderful with your companion pokemon and retelling of my favorite base game.






> **5: Do you have a favourite Pokemon?**

>> **TexasAndroid** A specific event Dragonite that I picked up in one of the Gen4 games, and which stayed with me for several games after that.

>> **Will-TVR** Before Sun/Moon were released, it was Latias, who still vies for the top spot from time to time. I have a very special one I transferred all the way from Sapphire to Alpha Sapphire. Someday I'll go back and finish getting all the contest ribbons on her...

>> **Draycen** Flygon. 200% my boy Flygon.

>> **RustRider** Drifloon. Don't you dare say anything about my Purple Balloon.

>> **leaffyleif** Froslass is best lass <3

>> **DavidLuizshair** Articuno, Espeon, Sylveon, Ampharos and Garchomp probably round off my top 5 in no particular order. No, Mega-Garchomp doesn't exist.

>> **bigslothonmyface** I mean, I mod like 10 Pokemon subreddits! Yes! Of course I have a favorite Pokemon :P It's Pidgeot, the bravest birb. Runners-up include Persian, Typhlosion, Tropius, Metagross, Luxray, Toucannon.

>> **Koni_Fox** This rotates some, if I'm totally honest. I've always liked quadruped pokemon, Raikou and Arcanine come to mind.







> **6: Why/how do you think the Pokemon series has remained such a massive franchise over the years? What differentiates it from the rest of the games from that era?**

>> **TexasAndroid** I tend to talk about how Pokemon manages to work on multiple levels, and do so very well.

>>On the surface it is, and always has been, a kid's game. And it works well at that. Game Freak is aware that their core target audience is constantly shifting as players age out of the target window and new players age into it.

>>But below that the mainline Pokemon games have several additional meta-games woven into them. And these meta-games also work very well. And GF works well to cater to their fanbase within each of these meta-games.

>>The two biggest meta-games are competitive play and collecting. There's an additional meta-game based around pokemon breeding that feeds into the two big meta-games.

>> **Will-TVR** It was huge for a Game Boy game as far as content and customizability were concerned - no other RPG at the time let you build a party by recruiting random-encounter enemies. I think it has continued simply because no other franchise rose far enough to compete with it, giving it the same kind of monopoly on its style of gameplay that Mario Kart holds on kart racing.

>> **Draycen** There's a simple charm to it that draws in youngsters. A healthy mix of cute and cool beasts to collect and train so you can steamroll your enemies, and having these creatures as the main selling point did it and helped Pokemon establish a solid identity that few could mimic in a way that would yield the same staying power. Combine that with a surprisingly deep set of mechanics that makes for a healthy competitive scene, and you have a series that crosses generational lines. This appeal to people both young and old, combined with easy marketability, has keep Pokemon alive for so long and will keep it alive for years to come!

>> **RustRider** If memory serves correctly the amount of marketing that I saw all the way back in when was basically pushing all kids into loving the franchise. The games, the anime, the TCG, all just combined to create a lasting impression on us as kids. So when we grew up, well we stayed fans. And pokemon never stopped appealing to kids so its just aggregating a huge fanbase.

>> **leaffyleif** It's approachable enough that Children can still play it (after all, at its core it's still a kids game) and it's competitive enough that long-time fans return for more. I think it's the combination of those two that keep the game alive. I know that I'll continue to play for as long as they continue to produce them (even after USUM, which I'm thoroughly disappointed in smh GF/TPC). I'm still trying to convince my partner to play though.

>> **DavidLuizshair** I think that because it's got aspects which can please the young crowd and the more... senior crowds as well. For example, I spend a lot of time watching and playing competitive on Showdown and sometimes with QR teams on cartridge, and it really allows me the ability and time to learn. In that sense, it gives me a lot as an adult because it's like got a lot of elements of tactical games, but it also has a kiddie enough element that any youngster can dive straight in.

>> **bigslothonmyface** I have written essays on this topic. IMO it's that the series appeals to so many different demographics in various ways—it's an adventure RPG but also a competitive strategy game but also a collect-a-thon but also a TCG and anime and movie franchise but also a mobile game. Very few franchises have diversified so well and permeated consciousness in so many different ways at once. And it doesn't hurt that they have a fantastic, silly core game model in which no to runs are identical, and that they add like 100 new Pokemon every few years.

>> **Koni_Fox** I think Pokemon has such a generalized appeal. In reality, the pokemon games are less of a series and more just one great base game that gets refreshed every now and then to keep up with technology and graphics and adding new pokemon and mechanics to keep things relatively fresh for those who remain loyal to the franchise.









> **7: The many spin-off Pokemon games often don't get as much attention as the main series games. What is your favourite of the spin-off games?**

>> **TexasAndroid** A very oddball one called Pokemon Conquest. It's a mashup of the Pokemon franchise with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms wargame franchise. Japanese warlords fighting each other for territory. But instead of soldiers they fight with pokemon. Quite strange, but it works. It helps that I'm a big fan of SRPG (Strategic RPG) games in general, and Conquest is the one and only Pokemon SRPG.

>> **Will-TVR** I know it's probably a common answer, but I'll have to go with Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. It was my first real introduction to the Mystery Dungeon games and remains my favorite in the series to this day. The art, music, and storytelling are all beautiful, and there's just so much to do. Someday I should actually finish the postgame stuff!

>> **Draycen** Play Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Seriously, those games are *stellar* in both gameplay and writing. Explorers of Sky is potentially one of the greatest games ever made (even though the Rescue Team games are my personal favorites- again, nostalgia). Also, they have amazing music, ""In the Morning Sun"" is one of my all time favorite songs.

>> **RustRider** Play Pokemon Ranger. It helped me in my withdrawal between Gen 3 and 4.

>> **leaffyleif** Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky, hands down. The most refined of the MD games.

>> **DavidLuizshair** I don't play any of them sadly. ;(

>> **bigslothonmyface** Pokemon Snap, and anybody who says different is a dirty liar has played more spinoffs than me and probably knows better.

>> **Koni_Fox** There was this one game for the Gameboy color based on the Pokemon card game. I didn't care about the card game at all as a kid, but for some reason I adored that game. The music was incredible, so I think that helped. I think I loved the novely of gameboy-graphics recreating the card images and it was oddly engaging.




> **8: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **TexasAndroid** I guess the only big one currently is seeing how to best survive the upcoming Reddit redesign, and in particular whether we'll come out of that with anything resembling our current flair system.

>> **Will-TVR** We don't have anything major planned for the time being. We'll see how smoothly we can transition once the sitewide redesign arrives. Hopefully we can keep our massive pool of flairs - we have flairs for all 800+ Pokemon, which requires some unique infrastructure that may or may not survive the transition without the need for a major overhaul.

>> **Draycen** All I plan personally is to keep setting up events and try to get more Subreddit-Discord integration going. We've seen a lot of success with our weekly events, and I would love to see that keep coming!

>> **RustRider** Preparing for the eventual onslaught of news about Pokemon on Nintendo Switch. Be wary of leaks people!

>> **leaffyleif** Not a clue.

>> **DavidLuizshair** Fuck knows.

>> **bigslothonmyface** One of the things I'm most proud of about us is that all of our rule changes and policy shifts of the last few years have come from direct community feedback. When we see a request for change we consider it and often do it, and when we come up with something we'd like to change ourselves, we ask and run trials before we do anything. Look for that to continue.

>> **Koni_Fox** I think we all just want to maintain our rules and policies. We change things from time to time, like implementing no fanart weekends as an example. I'd like for us to keep ourselves flexible and accessible so that our users can see real change when it is needed.




> **9: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **TexasAndroid** We're the central sub for a huge franchise. As such, we have to cater to multiple aspects of the franchise. The mainline games, yes, but also the anime, manga, TCG, fan art, side games, and other elements. We're constantly getting pulled in many different directions by different factions of the community. It's an interesting tightrope walk, but a fun one overall.

>> **Will-TVR** It's tough to manage a subreddit that's rapidly approaching the 1-million-subscriber mark, but it can be fun and rewarding. Even the ""bad"" users make for some interesting behind-the-scenes stories! I like how close-knit the team feels and the sense of fellowship we get from trying to maintain order in this chaotic corner of the 'Net.

>> **Draycen** I am beyond honored to be a part of this amazing team helping to run such a healthy and thriving community. Sure, there's always a few bad eggs, but they're far from the majority. Overall I'm working to help make a place where people can share stories, ideas, art, and make friends, and frankly that's all I could ever ask for. I'm proud of this community, and I'm proud of the people who help make it what it is.

>> **RustRider** Drifloon is best pokemon.

While the video game industry is constantly changing, Nintendo have managed to stay around since almost the beginning, with a couple of cherished franchises that are loved by many. Pokémon is one of these, and I think that, if Nintendo and Game Freak play their cards right, Pokémon can stay a massive name in the industry for many more years to come.

This is the subreddit I choose for the end of this week (Actually not the end anymore, prepare for some more posts in the next few days). It has been really fun to write an entire week themed around Nintendo but all things have to come to an end and so does this week. I know that I didn’t feature a lot subreddit’s I wanted to feature but I can only put so many of them into 7 posts. There are a lot of different subreddits that I didn’t mention but should have been worth a mention and for those who are seeking for these subreddits I’d recommend looking at this list https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/wiki/resources/subreddits created by /r/Nintendo containing nearly all Nintendo-related subreddits. 
So why Animal Crossing? Animal Crossing has always amazed me, not only the game but also the subreddit. For those who don’t know about Animal Crossing:

Animal Crossing New Leaf is the fourth game of the series featuring new villagers, places, items, mini games and the completely new feature of being the mayor of your own town. It is one of the most successful 3DS games that were ever released and that for good reason!

Let us start simple, in Animal Crossing you play as yourself in a town full of animals. On your arrival you’re greeted by your assistant Isabell and are tasked to be the next mayor of that town and that’s basically the whole story of this game. 
You’re now able to do whatever you want and this makes this game so unique! This game is meant to be played like you think you want to play it. It features a lot of different activities such as fishing, catching, “mining”, agriculture or just talking to your villagers.

Here’s a quick rundown of each activity and its benefits:

You can go to your local shop and buy a fishing rod and with that fishing rod you’re able to fish (yes, big surprise). The system works as follows: You see a little fish in the water, you throw your fishing hook onto that fish, wait until the fish takes the bait and than press A as fast as you can to catch it. As with fishing you have to acquire a net at your shop to be able to catch insects. You just have to slowly walk towards them and then aim your net at them and boom, you got the insect.  You can do different things with your fish and insects such as selling them, gifting them to the museum or just as furniture for your house.
There is also the ability to “mine” for gyroids and fossils by digging on certain places that are marked with an X. You can analyze these fossils at your museum and then go on to gift them to the museum, sell them or just placing them in your house. There is also a rock with a certain mineral each day, you can destroy that rock and sell the mineral for some bells.
At last you can also do agriculture by planting trees or flowers and reproducing them for some quick bells.

These are the main sources of income but for what do you need those bells?

Well, you can pay the loan for your house to increase its size, buy furniture, cosmetics such as hats, shoes and even socks. 

“Animal Crossing is fun because it lets you relax.”

In a time where most games are stressful Animal Crossing does the opposite. Animal Crossing is a game you’ll always come back to and have fun. It’s so impressive how the game manages to relax you by just being there. It’s fun because it keeps itself refreshing with things such as seasons, events, quests by villagers and a daily rotation of different things you buy to expand your house.
Another thing that I love about this game is the music. Animal Crossing has by far one of the most relaxing and immersing soundtrack. Every hour has different pieces that are also different depending on the season you’re playing in and all that together makes for one of the most fun games I have played in a long time.

Animal Crossing has always innovated everything with each new release and that was very clear with New Leaf. A crucial part I have not yet talked about is that you’re the mayor of the town and as mayor you have a lot of powers over your city. You can for example change the outdoor area by planning projects such as street signs, lamps, bridges or whole shops. You can also permit certain regulations such as the “early bird” one that forces everyone to wake up 2 hours earlier or the “beautiful city” one that forces your villagers to keep your city clean and water the flowers. 
This adds a lot more customization to your town when compared to older games. 

But the main focus of /r/Subredditoftheday is the Subreddit, so let us talk about /r/AnimalCrossing and not the game ^^

/r/Animal Crossing is probably one of the most chilled communities I haver ever seen by not only all the wonderful fan-made stuff on there such as birthday cakes, shirts, cosplays, cups or guides but also through all the posts about people cities in the game or how they created beautiful parks. Just the fact that I featured it recently and was still able to write an entirely new text about this game and subreddit of about 1000 words shows my pure love for this game and subreddit.
I know that this is not the type of stuff that everyone likes but I like it and so do the over 118k subscriber of this subreddit but I would recommend it to all friends of games such as Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley and Story of Seasons or people that are interested in rather relaxed games and/or Subreddit’s.

>**/u/_tomGER: 1) If you had to choose one thing that made this sub special, what would it be?**
>> **All mods of /r/AnimalCrossing:** *The community. Without all our amazing users the subreddit wouldn’t be as thriving and as kind as it is. Our users are the ones who make this subreddit special! As a franchise, Animal Crossing is a laid-back, at-your-own-pace type of game with little to no competition. This lends itself to a friendly and helpful subreddit where all of our users hope to see others succeed with their own town (or camp) goals.*

>**/u/_tomGER: 2) How much time did you spend in Animal Crossing / How do you feel about the game?**

>>**u/devvydowner:** *I’ve spent an inconceivable amount of time playing all the versions throughout the years; thousands upon thousands of hours, no doubt. It’s disgusting. This game is so special because you experience a wide range of emotions when you interact with your villagers and other in-game characters. The game becomes very personal, it’s not a game, it’s your town (or camp). You build relationships and become attached to characters, then they move out and you spend a day throwing pans before deciding to hack your DS to get Bob back in your town...*

---

>>**u/Callisto_Io:** *I’ve been playing Animal Crossing since City Folk, and have enjoyed watching the series as a whole evolve to encompass new crowds and game mechanics. I️ can safely say that I’ve loved the game since day one! I’ve been playing New Leaf, the latest full installment, for about five years as of now. The one thing that keeps me coming back is the open feel of the game (as well as the community!). I’d have to say, though, the community definitely strengthens the game. It provides such a lovely atmosphere, and allows trading/interactions of all types. You’ll seldom see an unhappy face here in the AC community; that’s what I️ appreciate the most.*

---

>>**u/birdwithbrow:** *I can't even imagine how long I've spent playing animal crossing, and yet despite having played every game for years at a time each there still so much I've yet to do!There are villagers still to be met, friendships to be forged, catalogues to fill and towns to be decorated. As a kid, I had very solitary gaming experiences. I played numerous MMOs, forum based sites and the like yet never felt like I was really part of a community and so kept to myself. Animal crossing was the first game I played with people I could truly consider friends. It brought me closer to my siblings as we rushed to see who could upgrade Nook's store first or pay off our loans, and it brought me closer to my family who enjoyed the peaceful nature that animal crossing has to offer and sat with me to watch me play. I handed out my friendcode to people online and engaged in trading, but also to play mini games on New Leaf's island tours. Animal crossing has a very special place in my heart and I feel the warmth of the community, the years long friendship between me and my villagers, and the nostalgia of when I first picked up the game every time I play.*

>**/u/_tomGER: 3) Do you think that /r/AnimalCrossing is a sub that everyone can enjoy?**

>>**All mods of /r/AnimalCrossing:** *To be 100% honest, no, but that’s the nature of subreddits. I don’t think any subreddit can appeal to everyone. If you’re someone who isn’t interested in the franchise, the subreddit probably wouldn’t even make much sense! Whenever we hit the front page or start trending, we see a large influx of reddit users who generally wouldn’t come to our sub otherwise, and the majority of those users do not become actual subscribers.

>>That being said, our subreddit is full of friendly and helpful users, so anyone that does enjoy the franchise can quickly and easily fall into our little community!*

A huge thanks to the mods of /r/AnimalCrossing!

####/r/Splatoon 

84,098 Squids, wait no, Kids ... ? for 3 years

Splatoon, Splatoon is the primary example I can give to people when they say Nintendo can’t innovate anymore and are too scared of changes. Splatoon is one of the most interesting games coming from Nintendo in recent times and has been one of the biggest newcomer hits. But what is Splatoon and why do 90% of my friends play that game? Splatoon is an shooter but unlike your typical COD-like shooter it’s running in an bright cartoon look with beautiful characters and maps where the main objective is to shot ink at the ground or capturing an payload and more if played in rank. Oh and have I already said that this game uses Squids (and soon Oktolings :)) as their playable character? Well, these little squids … or kids? Have the ability to turn into squids and swim in their ink. This concept is truly something unique that you couldn’t compare to other games but I’m here to talk about the subreddit and not sale you a copy of the game. /r/Splatoon mainly talks about changes to the game, Splatfests (monthly events in Splatoon), interesting clips and fan-art, beautiful fan-art. In all honesty, I’d probably say that Splatoon has one of the communities with the most talented artists. This place is truly a good place for every Splatoon player to share their thoughts and connect with people that like the same stuff.

Previously I only featured some-what serious Nintendo subs but today I’m gonna go full out and feature ***THE*** Nintendo shitpost subreddit and that being /r/tomorrow. /r/tomorrow as you might have guessed is just full of memes, jokes and shitposts but that is exactly what I love about this subreddit. It wouldn’t be fun to always stay serious but a lot of people want the opposite and just laugh about jokes that nobody else gets, well, nobody except Nintendo-fans. In all honesty this subreddit is something for everyone that just wants to make jokes and I think it manages to do that well. If you’re the type of guy who always makes jokes about the Switch that nobody gets you’re in heaven on that sub. It’s truly one sub I can always relay on giving me a chuckle. 

>Why exactly did you create this sub?

>>/u/Andis1:  Back before the Switch was formally announced we had a subreddit dedicated to the project's codename which was /r/NintendoNX. At that time we had no real idea of what the Switch would be or even what it would be called, and because of that the subreddit was filled with a lot of rumors, speculation, wish lists, and most predominantly memes. At the time the team wanted more of a discussion based community, but we were fine with the memes as there really wasn't anything substantial to talk about.

>>When the Switch did get announced we migrated the community to /r/NintendoSwitch, but it became clear very quickly that the memes and shitposts were dwarfing discussion now that there was actual content and news to discuss. Because of this we created /r/Tomorrow so that people would have a place to share and discover this riveting high quality content.

>>The name /r/Tomorrow was based on a perpetually rehashed meme from /r/NintendoNX, which was that the Switch would finally be announced ""tomorrow"".

>What are your most favorite posts on the subreddit?

>>/u/Andis1: There are a lot of great posts on /r/Tomorrow, most of which don't get the credit they deserve. A lot of the best posts mock current events or posts on /r/NintendoSwitch, and so the humor behind them gets lost over time. I'd have to say my favorite was probably the [/r/NintendoSwitch  Starter Pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/tomorrow/comments/7llayl/rnintendoswitch_starter_pack/) just because of how spot on it was (and to some degree still is) but there are so many good ones that it's hard to choose.

####/r/Kirby

12,413 Puyos for 8 years

/r/Kirby is truly one unique subreddit, I just recently discovered – This subreddit reflects the goofy and yet again thrilling atmosphere and story of Kirby, and I’m not joking when I say thrilling. /r/Kirby is a collection of memes and people that talk about the franchise and this mixture actually goes together pretty well. Kirby is one of those games that has a lot of meme-potential but always seems stupid to an out-sider so this subreddit is what I exactly needed. The community is truly amazing and the quality of memes is actually pretty surprising for a subreddit of this small scale. Kirby as a whole has always been this weirdly interesting game and franchise. I remember the hype my cousins and I had with the Kirby Channel on the Wii and I gotta admit that the Anime was actually super interesting and well produced even if I don’t include the nostalgic level it has on me – Just the story Kirby had in the Anime and how it managed to hide it. Kirby as a whole has always been something to carried me through my experience with gaming, starting with my first Kirby for the Gameboy, I should also mention that Kirby has probably the funkiest music there is with so many classic pieces that I couldn’t even list them. All in all, if you’re a Kirby fan looking for like-minded people I’d definitely recommend this sub.

#Interview with /u/Cardboard_Boxer:

>1) If you had to choose one thing that made this sub special, what would it be?

>>The sub is at a very interesting crossroad right now. Previously, I would have emphasized how tight-nit the community is, possibly comparing us to a small town where mostly everyone knows each other.

>>Star Allies kind of challenged that. The game is among the fastest selling in the Kirby series and, as a result, the sub has attracted many newer fans. We’re still adjusting to the change, for better or worse. 

>>I’d have to say that our ongoing growth spurt is what makes us special right now. While our humble community has built up a shared history with plenty of in-jokes over the years, it’s always exciting to see what new pages are added to the subreddit records by fans that only recently joined our ranks.



>2) How do you feel about Nintendo in recent days, do you think they changed their tactics?

>>There’s no doubt in my mind that Nintendo has shifted gears in recent days. The DLC, the cell phone games, the possible Mario movie, and the actually decent online gameplay all feel like products of a completely different company.

>>This has all resulted in a very successful Switch which makes me a very happy /u/Cardboard_Boxer. The Smash Bros, Pokemon, Metroid announcements have all been incredibly hype. I can’t wait to see what other new surprises pop up at E3! 

>>Besides, more Switch sales means more Kirby games for the console. That alone makes me excited for Nintendo's future.


>3) If you could choose one game, software, or firmware update to be made, what would it be and why?

>>I want my fully 3D Kirby already, HAL! What the heck is taking so long?

>>4) What's your most favorite Kirby game and what is your most favorite Nintendo console?

>> My favorite console is the 3DS. The Switch could earn that spot in the future, but it all depends on how expansive its library of games gets down the line.
 
>>As for my favorite Kirby game, I’m a bit indecisive in this area. I *think* my favorite Kirby games are Triple Deluxe and Robobot. I enjoy Triple Deluxe more in terms of story and bosses but I enjoy Robobot more in terms of gameplay and level design.

>5) What are your most favorite posts on the subreddit?

>>I’m a big fan of the arts and crafts stuff. People sometimes spend weeks or even months on their creations. Some of my favorite examples include a [a lovely quilt](https://redd.it/6uftqt), [an unsettling costume](https://redd.it/32n5hh), [a music box](https://redd.it/6ptwlm), [a stop-motion boss fight](https://redd.it/4yx9zt), and [a quirky little jazz/poetry combo](https://redd.it/67holv).

>>It’s actually why I started featuring art in the sidebar. It’s sometimes easy to miss this sort of thing between all the hype and memes.

#Interview with /u/JediwilliW:

>1) If you had to choose one thing that made this sub special, what would it be?

>>Definitely the community. Being both respectful, friendly and kind, there's always room for others to join in on the antics. The subreddit also has monthly challenges and thematic topics of discussions, which definitely helps keeping the talk active and alive.

>2) How do you feel about Nintendo in recent days, do you think they changed their tactics?

>>After the recent booming success of the Nintendo Switch, it's not hard to see that Nintendo have switched gears and are now focused on making that high interest last. Nintendo Directs are also more fastpaced and less goofy than what they were previously. It's focusing on getting a good amount of people interested in the Switch, which does seem to work. Personally i think it's fine, more success for Nintendo means longlivity in their products, but i can't help but miss the more sketch-like directs.

>3) If you could choose one game, software, or firmware update to be made, what would it be and why?

>>This isn't something i usually theorize about, but i do think a silly crossover game with a franchise heavily disconnected with Kirby could be interesting and fun. And hey, if Mario + Rabbits worked, then sure, why not. 

>>4) What's your most favorite Kirby game and what is your most favorite Nintendo console?

>> My favorite Kirby game would definitely have to be Kirby Triple Deluxe for the 3DS. There's a certain level of detail and depth hidden beneath the colorful and bubbly game. The soundtrack is also incredibly rich and varied, yet still manages to fit the level each track plays in.

>>As to favorite system, it is without a doubt the Nintendo 3DS. In all 8 years i've used the system, I've experienced an countless amount of amazing games, all filled with their own wonderful personal moments.

>5) What are your most favorite posts on the subreddit?

>>Art is always wonderful, whether rehosted or self-made.

####/r/NintendoMusic 

19,199 classic masterpieces for 4 years

If there’s one thing that I love about Nintendo games, it’s their music. Nintendo has one of the most beautiful and inspiring collections of music. I, myself am a huge fan of Animal Crossing’s music but I gotta admit that nearly everything that Nintendo throws at me sounds legendary. From the beautiful and funky soundtracks of Donkey Kong to the iconic music of Mario. /r/NintendoMusic is a community of like-minded people that share their most favorite Nintendo songs. This subreddit is really useful for anyone that needs some good ost’s to listen to or doesn’t know what songs to play. My favorite pieces are the hourly music in Animal Crossing, Fire Emblem Fates ost, Mario 3D World Browser Land Theme, Splatoon soundtrack and a lot more but I think you should just go and discover them yourself 😊

>1) If you had to choose one thing that made this sub special, what would it be?

>>**/u/derek66**: I think what makes this sub special are the amazing covers that are posted by users. While it is always nice to reminisce over classic tracks, I always enjoy seeing peoples covers of these tracks. Seeing how they reinterpret the music and make it their own in a way.

>2) How do you feel about Nintendo in recent days, do you think they changed their tactics?

>>**/u/derek66**:I feel like with the release of the Switch we have seen Nintendo adapt themselves somewhat while maintaining many of their same business practices, both good and bad. The switch almost feels like a redo of the Wii U, except with immensely better portability, better third party support, as well as strong first party support within the first year of its launch. It will be interesting to see how new games like LABO play out, as well as if we will actually see releases of Super Smash Bros, Metroid Prime 4, and a new Pokemon game. All three of those are ""confirmed"" for release this year but we will see!

>3) If you could choose one game, software- or firmware update, what would it be and why?

>>**/u/derek66**: Not sure what you mean by this, but if you are saying which one I am enjoying recently... Even though I am a huge Nintendo fan, the Zelda series has never resonated with me personally. However, Breath of the Wild not only became one of my favorite games in recent memory but probably of all time. From the games minimal soundtrack to its expansive environment it is hard to not get pulled into this experience.

>4) What are your most favorite songs?

>>**/u/derek66**: Some of my favorite Nintendo songs are [Factory Inspection from Kirby and the Crystal Shards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAB0uPsSY8w), [Stickerbrush Symphony from Super Smash Bros Brawl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJkVwt_JJXo), and [Route 104 from Pokemon Horn edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzxKmPYL73g).

>5) What are your most favorite posts on the subreddit?

>>**/u/derek66**: Some of my favorite posts include this one by /u/SmeenWasTaken, [which was a remix done by a Nintendo Composer as a tribute for Satoru Iwata after he had passed away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendomusic/comments/3d503r/nintendo_composer_hip_tanaka_remixes_balloon/)

>> This post by /u/wariosnose, [which was from an appearance where Shigeru Miyamoto performed the Mario theme on Jimmy Fallons show with The Roots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendomusic/comments/5h5hpp/shigeru_miyamoto_and_the_roots_perform_super/)**.**

>> And Lastly, as I said my favorite aspect of this sub are the original covers and remixes that we receive, here is one shining example by /u/joshuamilomusic, [which is a cover of Bob-Omb Battlefield from Super Mario 64](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendomusic/comments/38crjg/heres_my_newest_remix_of_sm64s_bobomb_battlefield/)

Nintendo is one of the most inspiring company’s I know. If you buy Nintendo you don’t buy some pc-like system, you buy innovation. Nintendo has always been the leading force in innovation by not only showing that you don’t need the most powerful system to win in the console market (I mean, look at the Wii and it’s specs – By the standards at that time this console was really laughable but it somehow managed to be the best of them) but also completely renovating the ways to play. So what is /r/Nintendo? /r/Nintendo is basically the father of all Nintendo-related Subreddits and the father-reference fits pretty well here since /r/Nintendo is often seen as way more serious than it’s comparing subreddit’s such as /r/NintendoSwitch, /r/wiiu, /r/3ds and more but that doesn’t mean that it’s the grumpy grandfather but rather that this is a good place for serious discussion of all Nintendo related changes and topics. /r/Nintendo is truly a place for every Nintendo-fan to come together for meaningful discussion and news and thus I’d recommend it to all those Nintendo-fans.

> 1) If you had to choose one thing that made this sub special, what would it be?


>>**/u/IwataFan**: The community is great! The most active members of our community often come up with really interesting discussion questions, which is the type of content we look for at r/Nintendo. I think Nintendo fans would find that this community is enthusiastic about Nintendo, but you can also have more critical conversations as well. The diversity of opinions at r/Nintendo is part of what makes the community particularly interesting for all kinds of fans.

>> **/u/protondo**: Really tightly connected community. Between the discussions, and the game club, and our Discord, we generally all love each other.

>>**/u/ThePoochyKid**: I feel that our focus on news and discussion gives r/nintendo a very different feel compared to many other subreddits, and has helped create such a well-defined community.

>>**/u/Subwizzle**: I love our community. We've got great discussion and great people here every day and it's really fun to be a part of. I also really like Game Club. Basically our community can compete against each other in fun challenges from random Nintendo games to earn points. It's definitely very engaging and cool to see some of the feats our community can pull off.

>>**/u/KalamityKappa**: Discussion posts are the heart and soul of the sub. Nintendo is so unique, and they have tons of different fans because of it, so it is really interesting to see their perspectives on Nintendo's systems, games, and series.


> 2) How do you feel about Nintendo in recent days, do you think they changed their tactics?

>>**/u/IwataFan**: Nintendo has had a dramatic turnaround with the release of the Switch in order to reach out to a wider audience of gamers, and perhaps non-gamers they are seeking to use their products. It has been exciting to be a part of this new era for Nintendo! I think the Nintendo Switch provides a refreshing gaming experience that I think is appealing to a lot of people.


>>**/u/protondo**: Nintendo has evolved a ton in the last half-decade. If you told me in 2013 that Nintendo's next console would have a new DOOM game, the biggest Zelda yet (at the launch of the system, no less), and the new 3D Mario game I could finally compare to Super Mario 64, I would call you way too optimistic and hopeful. Now, we're getting *Smash Bros.* **Smash Bros.!** This is really the best time to be a fan of Nintendo. 


>>**/u/ThePoochyKid**: Nintendo has approved significantly since their Wii and Wii U games in term of trying to target all types of demographics. From games for kids and families, like Nintendo Labo and Kirby Star Allies, to more mature games like Breath of the Wild and Dark Souls, the Switch really does have something for everyone.

>>**/u/Subwizzle**: I think current day Nintendo is the strongest Nintendo has been in a long time. The marketing for the Switch has been infinitely better than what they did for the Wii U. It's ""cool"" to own a Nintendo console again. They're getting great third party games like DOOM, Dark Souls and Rocket League and their future releases like Smash Bros, Pokemon and Metroid Prime 4 all have the potential to be massive hits too. It's a good time to be a Nintendo fan.

>>**/u/KalamityKappa**: A good bit, yeah! Getting more and more great AAA titles like DOOM and South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a big deal in comparison to the Wii U's lacking library in comparison. They've also worked hard to get just about every big indie on the system, with popular games with otherwise incompatible engines like UNDERTALE and Rocket League releasing on the Switch too.


> 3) If you could choose one game, software- or firmware update, what would it be and why?


>>**/u/IwataFan**: I personally would like to see *A Hat in Time*, an indie 3D platformer, make its way to Nintendo Switch. The developers already said it won't be coming to the platform unless they announce otherwise, but I think it would be wonderful to have their highly celebrated game on the Switch! 3D platformers are my favorite genre, and I especially like good 3D platformers, so I would be all for a port.


>>**/u/protondo**: A lot of the games I want have already been said by my fellow mods, so if I had to pick one not said already, it'd have to be Nintendo vs. Capcom. I know Super Smash Bros. is already Nintendo's fighting game, but Bandai Namco can have Tekken and Soul Caliber, so why not give Nintendo two fighting games? I was kind of disappointed with how Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite turned out, and since Nintendo is already in the game development business, unlike Marvel, I'm sure that they could help out Capcom make this game the best it could be. People from Capcom have shown interest in the idea, so at this point, I think it's up to Nintendo. 

>>**/u/derek66**:

>>**/u/ThePoochyKid**: I'm waiting patiently for a port/sequel to Super Mario Maker on the Switch. Being able to make levels on the go (oh who am I kidding, I'd mainly do it in my bed) would be amazing.

>>**/u/Subwizzle**: Honestly, the game I want to most right now is a new Mario Strikers game. The original and Charged were some of my most played games back in the day. My friends and I would just play for hours and hours. I'd love to see Next Level Games make a new Strikers for Switch featuring online play, local versus modes and lots of fun Mario characters to build your team with. The last game came out over 10 years ago. It's been too long.

>>**/u/KalamityKappa**: I'd love to see a game that basically does to Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World, what Sonic Mania did to the Sega Genesis era of Sonic the Hedgehog games. The New Super Mario Bros. series might exist, but I'd love a SNES esque take on the series, with new creative powerups and worlds.


> 4) What's your most favorite Nintendo game and what is your most favorite Nintendo console?


>>**/u/IwataFan**: I like to say that my ""nostalgic"" favorite game is *Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening* because I grew up with it and it has very quirky humor that I think embodies the earlier Nintendo era well. More recently, I really have been captivated by *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, just like everyone else. 
>>The Nintendo Switch is a heavy contender for the title of favorite console, especially when its library really fills out well. The hardware is just beautiful. However, I have a lot love for the Nintendo DS as well.


>>**/u/protondo**: My favorite Nintendo game is Super Mario 64. No contest. The perfect Super Mario game. Sure, it has flaws, but what game doesn't? It's my number one choice for Nintendo's next remake. (And no, I didn't like 64 DS that much. Mario 64 deserves more than the DS.) As for my favorite system, it'd have to be a tie between the Nintendo 64 and the Super Nintendo. The Super Nintendo has amazing games, amazing design, amazing everything. It's my favorite console of all time. The Nintendo 64 just had so much potential, with the Disk Drive, the online services, the raw power. Everything screwed up due to Nintendo's choice of cartridges on the system, rather than the new CD-ROM format. But, even after all that, the Nintendo 64 still has a smaller, but overall quality library. It'd probably be my third favorite console. Right under the PS2. 


>>**/u/ThePoochyKid**: Nothing quite compares to the DS Lite in terms of quality and quantity, but I think my favorite game has to be Super Mario Odyssey.

>>**/u/Subwizzle**: My favourite Nintendo game is The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. I absolutely love the creepy and dark atmosphere in the game and I think it has the best NPC storylines in the entire series. It was emotional, intense, had great dungeons and fun mask powers. I love everything about this game. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild might be a close 2nd though.

>>My favourite console is the N64. It came out right as I really started to get into video games and it helped pave the way for my love of them today.

>>**/u/KalamityKappa**: Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Mario World, which is, in my opinion, not only the best Nintendo game, but the best game ever made. With large world map with plenty to explore, alternate exits, interesting powerups, and Yoshi, there's not been a Mario game that's managed to top its fun since.


>5) What are your most favorite posts on the subreddit?


>>**/u/IwataFan**: We had a fantastic [AMA with David Soliani](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/74oinv/hi_i_am_davide_soliani_creative_director_of/?utm_term=9c8aabc4-829f-449f-9bad-93ccb8091e77&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=nintendo&utm_content=1), Creative Director for Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle, which I thought was a lot of fun.


>>Our users always come up with fantastic discussion ideas, such as [Why is the GameCube considers ""the good old days of Nintendo?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/7jhxpt/why_is_the_gamecube_considered_the_good_old_days/), which is a recent favorite of mine.
>>You can always find great posts on r/Nintendo, so my favorites change a lot!


>>**/u/protondo**: Throwdown Thursdays are hilarious to read. History posts are also really cool to see. Recently somebody posted a picture of the Nintendo section in a store. The picture was from '89, and it was a kiosk filled with Nintendo games, consoles, accessories, and merchandise. That has to be one of my favorite posts on subreddit at the moment, because it really shows you how times have changed. A bit of the magic is gone now that digital distribution is a big thing. 

>>**/u/ThePoochyKid**: Well I can't remember them all, but I'm quite a fan of the detailed analysis posts some users like to put up. I remember a discussion about Super Mario Odyssey's level design from a few months being particularly interesting.

>>**/u/Subwizzle**: I love discussion posts talking about anything from ""what we didn't like in a popular game"" to ""praises for some obscure game"". I love hearing our users thoughts and perspectives on Nintendo and their history. THROWDOWN THURSDAY is always a fun time too.

>>**/u/KalamityKappa**: You can't have ""Nintendo fan"" without ""disappointed the new Fire Emblem isn't announced yet"" and **THROWDOWN THURSDAY** is the perfect place for people to vent out about Nintendo not giving them exactly what they want.

####/r/NintendoSwitch 

545,142 Switchers for 1 year

---

If you live on the internet or some part of the world that has access to gaming consoles you’ve probably already heard of the “new” system from Nintendo by the name of “Nintendo Switch”. The Nintendo Switch is probably Nintendo’s biggest success since the Wii and that’s for good reason. This little hybrid between home-console and portable handheld. This success in the console reflects the success of this subreddit. /r/NintendoSwitch is one of the fastest growing subreddit’s I have ever seen and a lot of that is thanks to the constant event’s like Developer AMA’s, even going as far as official Nintendo AMA’s and Nintendo responding to some threads with their own reddit account (Something I found pretty unusual at first since Nintendo is normally known for never responding to their community). /r/NintendoSwitch also features a rich-cast of posts ranging from posts about Switch games to Switch related stuff. I’d say that this sub is a most subscribe for all Nintendo Switch owners or true Nintendo fans.


*I wanted to add a interview with the mods here but the mods didn't respond so have a interview I answered myself here:*

>1) How do you feel about Nintendo in recent days, do you think they changed their tactics?

>>/u/_tomGER: Yes, I think Nintendo finally moved on from being the company branding themselves as a kids-console to a company branding themselves as a console for everyone - They also finally moved on from the repeating game design to brand-new stuff such as Splatoon, Breath Of The Wild and Mario Odyssey

>2) If you could choose one game, software- or firmware update that Nintendo would publish, what would it be and why?

>>/u/_tomGER: As you may know, I'm a huge Animal Crossing fan so if they would publish it right now I'd probably scream like a little fan-boy :D I'd also really like if they did more with the switch in a future firmware update, I have never seen such a empty day-1-like firmware like the Switch has

>3) What's your most favorite Nintendo game and what is your most favorite Nintendo console?

>>/u/_tomGER: I'd probably say that my most favorite Nintendo game is either Super Mario Bros, Animal Crossing Let's go to the City (Or ""City Folk"" depending on your location) or Smash Bros Brawl but I have so many games that I keep close to my heart that I'd be impossible for me to list them like that.

>>My most favorite console is probably the Wii just because it was such a revolution back-then and I'm still having a lot of memories playing with it to this game, but I also really liked the SNES and Game Cube for Super Mario Bros and Mario Strikers ^^Please ^^give ^^me ^^another ^^one, ^^thanks

>4) What are your most favorite posts on the subreddit?

>>/u/_tomGER: Probably the AMA with developers, specifically indie developers - I don't know why but I really love seeing them with so much passion for their games

You know that feeling. When you're playing an online game, and some 12 year old goes into chat and threatens to DDOS you because you're clearly better than him. Or he says he has a friend who will do it for him, but he's full of shit either way? This is where you go to laugh and post about these children.

Some of my favorite all-time posts in /r/masterhacker are [I got messaged by a master hacker](https://i.redd.it/2xeomld9crj01.png), [Creepy PM from a “reddit admin”](https://i.imgur.com/KkJDTeL.jpg), and [I have a VPN](https://i.redd.it/roelpssm4xi01.jpg). They follow the appeal of subreddits like /r/insanepeoplefacebook, /r/iamverybadass, or /r/quityourbullshit. But instead of crazy people, our subreddit follows the topic of people who say they're really good at hacking when in reality they know very little.

/r/Masterhacker is a satire oriented subreddit. A lot like /r/insanepeoplefacebook, we usually ridicule people for being full of bullshit and plainly ignorant. This subreddit was made for posting people who threaten to Hack your PC or claim that they are a part of Anonymous or Lizard Squad. But that's not the only posts we approve of in this subreddit. We also love seeing posts where people claim to know about hacking or have intimate computer knowledge, when in reality, they're begging to appear on /r/iamverybadass. We also like to use a lot of hacker slang, so you better read up on it before you get your c++ ip backroot firewall hacked.

**71,274** Chads and Normies *battling incels* for  **11 Months!** 

IncelsTears is a subreddit to document and laugh at the irony, narrow-minded thinking, and refusal to see what they're actually saying. If you don't know what an incel is, the mods at Incel Tears have you covered!

>#1. What is an incel? 

>>**AndySamburgPants**  Well, the term incel is a contraction, for the involuntary celebate. What an incel is varies from person to person, it seems. It can describe a group of men who are either unable to lose their virginity and the shame they feel, or it could describe someone who is going through a 6-month or longer dry spell. The latter was the definition officially used on r/incels way back when, but it was always challenged when it came up. The challenges they face are often -cel, so heightcel, lookscel, mentalcel, but it gets sillier, like wristcel, ricecel (Asian-cel), and currycel (another kind of Asian-cel).

>>**SocialPsychProj**  Well, there’s really two definition of what an incel is at this point, the “literal definition of incels” and the “social definition of incels”. The literal definition is an “involuntary celibate”, someone who would like to have sex, but can’t due to whatever reason. The social definition is a person, usually a man, who is a self-described incel, who believes that they are not able to have sex because of their appearance, often holds misogynistic views against women, and on some level blames women and society for their celibacy, and on some level feels entitled to sex. [The] definition can vary on how much they crossover from person to person.

Now that you know what an incel is we can continue! At Incel Tears you can meet non misogynistic, fun people that can all take a good look and laugh at the [complete irony,](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/6map5u/the_irony/) judge the complete [misogyny and hatred](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/6oidup/lol_the_fuck_dude/) and to just in general try and help incels [young](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/6xwv20/rincels_has_14_year_old_members_and_the_sub_is/) and [old, which this one did](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/7xlmkc/56yearold_incel_loses_virginity_to_pretty/)

With these posts and the friendly and accepting community that's always ready to help it's a great sub to join and you can definitely make some friends. If you ever get the chance and please head over. Now I'll turn it over to the moderators of the sub to answer some questions about the sub!
>##1. What are some the funniest/stupid things you've seen incels say? 

>>**SocialPsychProj**  Probably the most hilarious thing I’ve seen so far was from a couple months ago, there was an incel that didn’t know Mexicans weren’t just natives, AKA “brown people”, so he said “in what universe are Mexicans white?”. That level of ignorance and racism made me wonder how he would shit his pants if he found out there were indeed, not only white people who were Mexican, or European Mexicans as they are called, but also African and Asian Mexicans. For petes sake, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, was some random white dude who attended Harvard. Unless you heard him speak you would think he was some grandpa from Kansas who watched Fox News.

>>**AndySamburgPants**  Oh Sweet Odin above, the dumbest thing they've said? The incels who are serious about ""oooh, my ears stick out a bit. EARCEL HERE"" or the Arby's memes they keep dropping; the more sex a woman has the more outie her vulva is, and the more worn out it is. Lately I've been rolling my eyes into my brain over the ""milkies from mommy"" thing that some of the users on r/braincels seem to have going.

The funniest? When Reddit's [admin](https://i.redditmedia.com/dACDX6AI6mxGISgxYY6Viaruv02xDJTzW8cUfDueRws.jpg?w=1024&s=89865836a7376fcdc370df935627243e) actually told us to keep documenting their drivvel. Or that a woman, who has skin as thick as it comes, is actually running the show over in r/braincels now.

>##2. Have you ever experienced brigading from incels?

>>**SocialPsychProj**  Honestly there isn’t much “brigading” from incels on the sub, it’s more of you make a post and some guy will come on and be like “you’re all virgin shaming bullies, why do you want us all to kill ourselves” or “um, it’s hebephilia, 14 year old girls aren’t children”.

>>**AndySamburgPants**  Brigading? Probably. It's hard to tell where traffic is coming at us from. Interestingly, although we have four times their users they often have more traffic. It's probably just schadenfreude.

>##3. How hard is it to mod this sub and what are some of the difficulties that come with it?

>>**SocialPsychProj** It’s pretty easy, it’s only become kind of frantic recently from all the new people coming in to check out the sub, commenting and posting without being aware of the rules and formality. And since the sub has a filter to prevent troll posts and inappropriate content, you always have those guys that make some giant text post about how “you guys are all incels in denial”, I always tell them the post isn’t going to go public and that only the mods will ever see it, but like clockwork they keep coming. And when you ban someone? Don’t get me started, you either have the person that freaks out and earns a permanent ban(his can be incels or non-incels), the person who tries to play dumb and say that “It’s not sex slavery because I would be kind and gentle to my female”, or the person who doesn’t say anything, and then 5 months later breaks their head through the metaphorical door to say “AND ANOTHER THING-“

>>**AndySamburgPants**  The only thing I find difficult is dedicating enough time. I'm at a pretty busy time of the year so it doesn't leave a lot of down time. I'm really quite glad to have the rest of the mod team working with me. I don't find the job particularly difficult, though.


Now that we have the questions answered about the sub, I need to give you the true secret reason behind it... To bring light to the fact that incels are now doxxing innocent members of the Incel Tears community. They are saying that for everyday the sub isn't deleted they're releasing personal info. Even if the threat is just a threat we need __***you***__ to help!

>##1. How do you plan to respond to the doxxing threat?

>>**SocialPsychProj**  Well we of course have reported this whole fiasco to the admins, not sure how that’ll turn out. We’ve already responded to the post by making it a main post on the sub, and as you can see by the post, I have been personally responding to the person threatening to six myself.

>>**AndySamburgPants** I reported it to admin, stickied the ""negotiations"" on r/inceltears, drank my coffee and went to work.

>##2. Are you concerned?

>>**SocialPsychProj**  Me? I wouldn’t say I’m concerned as much as I’m encouraging, for the doxxing of myself at least. As I’m typeing this the infomation of the first person is going to be released in about 8 hours, and I have repeatedly told this person that I want to be the first person doxxed, and if the first doxxing comes and it isn’t me, I’ll be pretty disappointed.

>>**AndySamburgPants** I don't care. I'm behind a VPN, I don't talk about my life that much, and I throw out the odd red herring. I'm curious who the chosen ""high profile"" users are. I have a few ideas, but 20? Somebody needs a new hobby.


>##3. What do you feel is the proper punishment for what they're doing?

>>**SocialPsychProj**  I hope that dude steps on lego. Like, a lot. A lot of stepping and a lot of lego.

>>**AndySamburgPants** I mean, considering doxxing is illegal I hope we find this guy or group and get them arrested before the can release the infomation of anyone that isn’t me.


>##4. If your information is released what is the current plan of action?

>>**SocialPsychProj**  ..? I dunno, my family knows my user name here and what I'm doing. What's the worst that'll happen, my shoulder will hurt from too many high fives? We even had a good chuckle when r/incels was banned. I mean like, what are they going to do? I personally know the members of my local police and fire brigade.

>>**AndySamburgPants** Probably pop out that bottle of wine I’ve been saving for a special occasion. I’m serious, if I don’t find myself at work and see that my social security number is public infomation, I’m going to really be doubting the skills and abilities of these people.

>##5. What can people do to help, if anything?

>>**SocialPsychProj**  ***JOIN THE FIGHT***. Or come and enjoy the lulz at r/inceltears. Y'know. Nobody should get too worked up.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

>>**AndySamburgPants** At this point what everyone can do is try to get incels.me taken down, and you can do that by contacting their host, Cloudflare.






So I ask of you, please help Incel Tears respond to this fiasco!

#### r/ShingekiNoKyojin

**86.6k Scout Legionnaires** for **5** years

**Attack on Titan**, also known by its Japanese name *Shingeki no Kyojin*, is a manga series by Hajime Isayama started in 2009, adapted into an anime in 2013. A century ago, giant beings, the titans appeared and consumed most of mankind. The remnants of humanity found refuge behint 50m high walls. Humanity lift protected from titans inside the walls for a hundred years, until the Colossal Titans destroys the gate of the outer wall. Humanity is driven back, losing a third of its remaining territory, realizing they live in a bird cage. 

The story follows the childhood friends Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert who dream of exploring the world behind those walls. Eren, who lost his mom to a titan, is filled with hate and the resolve to eviscerate all titans.

It's one of the most successful manga and anime series and the story took several turns. A genre mix with a lot of mystery describe it quite well. A cruel world in which titans consume humans. The subreddit offers discussions, theories, news, artwork, and even a team coloring the manga. But the highlight of every month are the New Chapter Megathreads, with thousands of users discussing the new chapters, thousands of comments and thousands of upvotes. Moreover, this here in July, the 3rd season of Attack on Titan will start airing. Of course, we will have a rewatch of season 1 and 2 before and then celebrate the weekly broadcast with our New Episode Megathreads.

Three posts (I only chose spoilerless posts, we have a strict spoiler policy and no one new should be spoilered):

* [As promised, I recreated the entire first chapter of the manga using the anime](https://redd.it/6iwfbl) - The first chapter, recreated with scenes from the anime
* [This community is great!](https://redd.it/7r1xdb) - Exactly right!
* [Female Titan cosplay by Alyson Tabbitha](https://redd.it/6jskmz) - We don't have much cosplay, but this made it to the front page.

""Mod Interview"":

# Tell us a little about yourself!

u/EricCassidyWalton: Hello, my name is Eric. I am a 19\-year\-old college student in my second semester studying Computer Science. I am from Texas but haven’t been to many places outside of my hometown. I love astronomy and stargazing.

u/kemorsky: My name is Kamil, I'm from Poland.

u/prati616: I'm from Canada and I've been told that I don't sleep. I've been active on the sub for less than 10 months and I proudly became a moderator just a few weeks ago.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  I am a remote systems admin for a big corporation and I'm also a huge  nerd that likes things but is too picky about them. Talk to me about  Jojo sometime.

# How did you get involved in r/ShingekiNoKyojin?

u/DarthMewtwo: I've been a redditor for a long time, so when I finished Attack on Titan I searched for the subreddit to discuss the series. I had lots of theories I wanted to talk about, but I ended up getting spoiled on the Colossal and Armored Titans so I gave in and read the manga.

u/EricCassidyWalton: I do not remember when specifically, I found the subreddit, all I can remember is my first post was April 17th, 2016.

u/kemorsky: Honestly? I don’t even remember. I think I got to a thread through an outside link and then checked out the rest, only to then stay on the sub.

u/prati616: About halfway into Season 2 I decided to start reading the manga. I found the subreddit then during the legendary ""Chapter 94 Pre\-Release Megathread"" and I quit lurking once Season 2 ended.

u/toutoune134: Back in 2014 I was looking for a community where I could talk about Attack on Titan and share my passion of the franchise. r/ShingekiNoKyojin was the perfect place for that.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  After the first season ended I wanted to talk about the characters  because I'm a character guy and that was prime Annie time. I think that  speaks to a lot of my history with the subreddit actually.

# Do you have any hopes for the community going forward?

u/DarthMewtwo: I would love to see us grow even further and be recognized by the official distributors of the anime/manga. We've had some participation from Kodansha in the past, but they seem to have gone away. \<strikethrough\>Kodansha\-senpai pls\</strikethrough\>

u/EricCassidyWalton: I hope that the community can keep growing. Moderating a stagnating community isn’t fun, but with the upcoming season 3 and monthly manga chapters that shouldn’t be an issue. I hope that the community gains more active well\-known contributors, also.

u/kemorsky: I hope that with the more frequent production of anime seasons, people will get back their interest in the franchise. The 4 years long wait made many fans disinterested in the continuation, but now with the possible 1 Season per year schedule, this passion may be reborn. I hope we can build a big, peaceful community, that respects each other and continues to watch SnK until the end.

u/prati616: I'm hoping more would consider reading the manga. The more manga readers that we can discuss \*\*Attack on Titan\*\* with, the better.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  Two of the things I'm most proud of with this community is our  accessibility and our ability to dive deep into discussion about  anything. I'm hopeful that continues.

# When did you first get interested in the Attack on Titan franchise? How did you get in touch with Attack on Titan?

u/DarthMewtwo: My high school had an anime club, and in my sophomore year we watched the first three episodes of Attack on Titan. It was a horrendous troll translation named Eotena Onslaught, but it was enough to get me interested. It was also the same day that the final episode of the first season aired.

u/EricCassidyWalton: Back in 2013, my friend in high school showed me the first scene from episode 1 of season 1. It looked really high quality, something I never expected for an anime back then \(with my only experience being maybe three older anime like \*Inuyasha\*, \*Pokémon\*, or \*Naruto\*.\). And the concept interested me. Humanity fighting giants in steampunk\-esque military gear.

u/kemorsky: At the very end of Season 1, back in 2013. After seeing it literally everywhere for 6 months, I simply gave up and gave it a try. It was worth it.

u/prati616: Around August 2014, but I stopped caring about a year later until Season 2 picked up.

u/toutoune134: I started reading the manga in July 2011 thanks to discussions on other forums and some pages catching my eyes. It was quite obscure back then!

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  My old raid buddies told me about this anime called Attack on Titan  where these crazy horrible things were happening to people and it was  super intense and I was like ""Wow that sounds pretty neat I should watch  that."" I binged the whole first season and thought ""There's probably a  group out there somewhere I can get into to talk about this thing.""

# What are your plans for the sub in the future?

u/DarthMewtwo: If we're able to pull it off, my April Fools' Day plans will be legendary. That's all I'm going to say.

u/EricCassidyWalton: I hope to include more community collaborative events. Subreddits like r/BokuNoHeroAcademia have lots of community activities. I also hope for the sub to look nice after the redesign.

u/kemorsky: I want to keep it as clean and friendly to newcomers, as well as veterans, as possible.

u/prati616: I would really like it if there could be more activities involving the sub as a whole.

u/toutoune134: Making sure that more people will come to r/ShingekiNoKyojin and make them stay during downtime \(between chapter/episode releases\).

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3): My plans are to keep the wheels from falling off and to support however I can in that effort.

# What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

u/DarthMewtwo: Obviously my own legendary PLEASE UPVOTE THE COLOSSAL TITAN comes to mind, or the time I sent a post of the flair of u/Stiller3 modified to look like Hitler to the top of the subreddit. But I'm also a particular fan of some of the modified chapters that make \(gentle\) fun of the moderators, and \[this post\]\([https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/64z1w2/i\_feel\_like\_a\_fucking\_retard/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/64z1w2/i_feel_like_a_fucking_retard/)\) is still one of my favorites.

u/EricCassidyWalton: Shingecko No Kyojin / Another Thor\-chan fan art…

u/kemorsky: One of my favorite posts are usually the art that comes out after each chapter. The scenarios people come up with are simply marvelous at times, and the fan\-made character meetings, fights, interactions are often very pleasant to look at. I also enjoy the predictions for the upcoming chapters, especially when they are based on some already existing evidence found in the latest chapter.

u/prati616: It's hard for me to like just one post. The kinds of posts that I love are the ones that I can see were made by a person that has a love like no other for the series, and they're proud to show it.

u/toutoune134: The Chapter Release Threads, where people talk about the latest chapter. They are the most productive threads of the subreddit, and it's always a joy to see regulars and newcomers reacting to the events of the manga and creating theories. Also the PLEASE UPVOTE THE COLOSSAL TITAN multi\-shitpost!

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3): When we  get into real discussions those are a lot of fun. I enjoy those the most  when we're really pulling at themes and motivations.

# If you could have your way, how would you punish people who spoil the anime?

u/DarthMewtwo: Send them all to Paradise. Manga jokes aside, I frequently find myself extremely frustrated at my lack of power to remove YouTube comments or things on other subreddits.

u/EricCassidyWalton: I would sit them down in front of their mother and tell on them.

u/kemorsky: It depends on the circumstances. If on purpose, then I’d hand out a permanent vacation ticket on the spot. I find people who spoil things on purpose repulsive.

u/prati616: We'd let them know what it's like in Heaven. \*laughs in manga\*

u/toutoune134: Headbutt.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  Accounts should be removed, bans should be enacted, someone should go  to that guys house and kick their computer out a window.

# What motivates you to mod r/ShingekiNoKyojin?

u/DarthMewtwo: I want to protect the experiences of people discovering the series for the first time, and I've always had a passion for being one of the guiding hands behind communities I'm a part of.

u/EricCassidyWalton: Darth said I became a mod because I kept spamming the other mods with stuff to remove, so I guess just always being here and seeing the lack of mod activity to remove.

u/kemorsky: The feeling that I can make a difference. Yes, you do turn people against you, especially if they do not understand their wrongs, but that is a small price in comparison to making hundreds of other users happy, and seeing them truly enjoy themselves.

u/prati616: The fact that I can influence the community I hold close to me, and how I can help make it as perfect as possible with the other users of the subreddit.

u/toutoune134: A community is nothings without its members, so I want to make sure that users will feel conformtable when they visit r/ShingekiNoKyojin and that they will want to come back later. Sometimes we mods have to be strict, but this is for the greater good.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  Investment time? Being the most senior mod next to the owner, even just  speaking about the franchise as a whole, it's satisfying in a nostalgic  sense to see how things have progressed and where we're going to as we  approach the end.

# Who is your favourite character and why?

u/DarthMewtwo: I've always loved Kenny. Anime viewers will be meeting The Law very soon, and I can't wait for their reactions.

u/EricCassidyWalton: Annie is my favorite character because she is best girl.

u/kemorsky: I do not have a favorite character. I like some more than others, and that’s it.

u/prati616: My favourite character is rather unconventional since I don't think many people fully care for him, but honestly, I like Mike Zacharias. Badass, calm, and respected.

u/toutoune134: Erwin. His leardership, his charisma, his will to make things move forward, the depth of his character and his eyebrows make him my favorite character.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  Annie has always and will always be my favorite character because of  how well written she was from the beginning of the show. Her story is as  tragic as Reiners and her own personal beliefs resonate with me,  alongisde the fact that she's a badass fighter and doesn't take shit  from anybody.

# What's the meaning behind your username?

u/DarthMewtwo: I've been using this username for a very long time. When I was a kid I absolutely loved Star Wars and Mewtwo was my favorite Pokémon, \(both of these are still true\), so I combined them.

u/prati616: I can't even remember the first part to be 100&#37; honest. Reason changes every year. The 616 means June 16, my birthday.

u/toutoune134: toutoune is my real life nickname. 134 because ""toutoune"" was already taken when I tried to create a login for the first time online and I got ""toutoune134"" as suggestion.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  I've had it since the beginning of time. In Yinzer Stiller translates  out to Steeler. I'm a Steelers fan. I was like 10 when I made it up.

# Do you prefer the manga or the anime, and in what respect?

u/toutoune134: Both are great, but the manga will always be my favorite. The anime makes things more epic and looks cleaner, but isn't as gritty and straightforward as the manga.

u/DarthMewtwo: As much as I love the manga, you can't beat having things in full color with beautiful music behind them.

u/kemorsky: Anime. Manga is great, but seeing certain scenes animated, with the visuals, music and voice acting is an experience on a whole new level.

u/prati616: The anime. The music, the animation, the color, the voices...it all combines into something that is stupendous.

u/EricCassidyWalton: If the whole series were animated right now, I would prefer the Anime. But I know that I prefer the story after season 2 anime than I do seasons 1\-2.

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3):  The manga I prefer in terms of experiencing and understanding the story  and characters. The anime is better at producing feels and bringing it  all together.

# Anything else to add?

u/DarthMewtwo: #GabiDidNothingWrong

u/EricCassidyWalton: Read the manga, Y’alll!

u/kemorsky: Drop by r/shingekinokyojin, we have memes.

u/prati616: If you're fully caught up on the manga, I highly recommend checking out the subreddit's Monthly Manga Festivals. Those are great and wholesome times for the entire community!

[u/Stiller3](https://www.old.reddit.com/u/Stiller3): Annie's best girl.

**180,308 prints going for 8 years!**

3D printing used to seem like it was a far away technology that only existed in sci-fi, but nowadays you can get a good 3D printer for <$300! /r/3Dprinting is a hub for the community that expanded around this technology. For those who are interested in 3D printing, looking at stuff in this subreddit can help get you into the hobby.

What can you use 3D printing for? There is more uses for it than you might think. You can use it for small things like trinkets and toys, but surprisingly you can use it for functional uses as well. I've personally have made many prints (many I've designed myself) that do practical things like replacing broken parts and headphone stands. I also know of many people using it to make functional prototypes instead of paying to get injection molds, which costs waymore. 

How does 3D printing work? The most common type of 3D printer (called an FDM or FFF printer) is by laying down molten plastic, and letting it harden into the object. This process takes time, but is much cheaper than other processes such as injection molded parts.

A popular place to get free files to print is a site called [""Thingiverse""](https://www.thingiverse.com/). A couple popular prints are [a calibration boat called ""Benchy""](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622), and a [measuring cube](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676324). My favorite thing to print is to print out models (like [tanks](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:769137)), and paint them with acrylic paint.

One major question is ""what printer should I get"", and this is entirely personal. Always do your own research into every printer, and don't just blindly pick one. 3D printing has been an evolving market, so always make sure you look at recent recommendations. Another thing to be aware of is that many printers are sold as kits, where you have to assemble it by hand. Most of the time kits require setting up electronics, and might have open power supplies, which can be dangerous. For getting your first printer, I'd recommend not getting a kit because of that.

/r/3Dprinting is a great place for things like finding cool prints, helping new people get in the hobby, asking questions, and getting help making your printer work at top capability. It's the best for getting good discussion on subjects, and almost every problem you might have, someone will have been there, and will help you through the problem. The other thing that the subreddit does is inspire for what to make next. Some of the coolest posts to me are like [this amazingly fine tuned printer](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/7sl16b/satisfying_gif_of_my_cr10_bridging_a_150mm_gap/), or this [oddly satisfying fit](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/5tasn0/i_made_some_super_satisfying_twist_containers/).

**Commonly Used terms**

CAD: Computer Aided Design, The way how you make or edit models on the computer

.STL: The most common type of file used in 3d printers

G-Code: The type of file that the 3D printers use to print objects

Slicer: The program that lets you turn a .STL/OBJ files into G-Code. This is where you determine factors such as layer size and supports.

Infill: The amount of plastic in the insides of the model. the more infill you have, the stronger the print is, but the more plastic you use.

FDM/FFF: A common type of 3D printer. This printer works by it melting plastic in a moving heated block, and laying that plastic down on the model. This is generally what most hobbyists use. The terms FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) and FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) often get interchanged.

Resin Printer: it uses a tub of resin and a laser to form the model. Generally they are more expensive and require more processing than a FDM printer, but they can make more detailed prints. The two common types of resin printers are called SLA and DLP.

Filament: The plastic used in most printers to make objects.

Here is an interview from the mods of /r/3Dprinting 
>##How did you get into 3D printing?
>>**/u/xahk** About three years ago now, I got a 3D printer with the goal of making custom Nerf guns and printing out some of my video game character ideas. Shortly after getting my first machine, a Printrbot Simple Metal, I realized two things. One, that I was terrible at judging foam ballistic properties, and two, that I really had very little interest in making textures, UV maps, skeletons or animations for anything I made. It was around then that I started learning CAD, and working on more practical devices. Throughout all of that, and the three semi-functional to moderately usable printer frameworks that came after, I found this community to be absolutely indispensable for advice, and after the departure of a moderator last year, I decided to apply to help out with maintaining it.
*****
>>**/u/veive** My wife told me I needed a hobby, and I clicked /r/random and found /r/3dprinting, so I bought the cheapest kit I could find and built a printer, this was back when printrbot made wooden kits. It was a load of fun to get working, and I had a blast.

>>About a year later /u/traverseda asked me if I would help moderate and here we are.

>##What is your favorite printer currently?

>>**/u/xahk** Currently I've been using a Monoprice Ultimate (sold elsewhere as a Wanhao Duplicator 6) for everything. Despite the praise often lavished on Monoprice's other offerings, the Ultimate is really an underrated little gem of a machine, and uses some parts of a quality not seen on machines twice, or three times its going price. There's also my own personal devices, but as my current one has yet to be fully finalized, I'd rather wait until I've finished some more testing to go into more detail on it.
*****
>>**/u/veive** The Monoprice Select Mini. I can't say that it's run flawlessly, but it has run well enough for me to print replacement parts for anything that broke, and for $200 it's tough to beat.

>##What is your favorite thing to print?

>>**/u/xahk** Mostly functional components, with occasional favors to others, funny ideas I find online, or gifts for others. It's always amazing seeing something that existed solely on a screen built line by line, layer by layer by a finely tuned machine, and I doubt I'll ever get tired of the feeling of pulling something I've created off the bed, snapping it into place, and using something I'd just thought would be useful the day before.
*****
>>**/u/veive** Stuff for my kids. They love stuff like a [toy car](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21214) or a [fidget spinner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2309267)
There are also a staggering number of small plastic bits and bobs that are needed. Stuff like a [cupboard lock](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2365101), or a [doorknob cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2842381), I've even printed a [drawer knob](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:76436)

>>A lot of the plastic things that we use every day cost around 50 to 100 times as much at the store as it would cost to print them.

>##What's moderating the sub like? 

>>**/u/xahk** It's, well, interesting, to say the least. After the sub was added to /r/popular when that feature was introduced, its userbase has exploded, which has been great, in some ways, but means the community has become much less tightly-knit, and led to more than a few growing pains. Really, the biggest problem comes when users that are used to discussions about fairly subjective topics (entertainment, games, etc) apply a similar logic to the discourse on /r/3DPrinting. This can lead to problems, as a number of things relating to the danger of certain components, correct handling of materials, and the like, really only have one correct answer, as they're rooted in the simple reality of the technology.

>>However, that aside, this community has come together to do some amazing things, and I'm proud to be able to try and help it flourish. The collaboration, support, and knowledge of this community is hard to understate. From newcomers that just bought their first machine, to CEO and technicians that have been a part of the field for over a decade, this sub has served as the launchpad for a wide variety of ideas, gotten countless previously thought to be un-salvageable machines back online, and serves as a sort of water cooler for a large part of our community.
*****
>>**/u/veive** Kinda overwhelming sometimes. We have added like 2 or 3 mods since we were at 20,000 users, we are pretty careful about who gets to be a mod, since you need to have a good understanding of 3D printing.

>>We've had to ban a few people who thought that giving advice that could start a fire or poison someone was funny, so it's important for the moderators to know when someone is giving bad or dangerous advice.

>>However, people should remember that redditors are just random strangers on the internet. Take advice that you get from reddit with a grain of salt!

>##What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>>**/u/xahk** I don't have the links anymore, but I don't so much have a set of favourite posts as I do a favourite type: scrap bots. Sometimes called ScrapRaps (for Scrap Rapid prototypers), or RepStRaps (Replicating bootStrapped Rapid prototypers), these are machines built out of parts found lying around, either to prove it was doable, or as a means to build the parts for a larger, more powerful machine. Seeing someone create something capable of manufacturing precise components out of nothing but old disk drives, dot matrix printers, moving on fishing line, lifted by threaded rods from a hardware store, and powered by some spare parts hooked to a breadboard is absolutely fascinating to me, and never fails to capture the imagination of both myself and many of the other users here. Not too long ago, a user built a printer that was run entirely on screw drives left over from the inside of a few CD drives, with a 3D pen hooked to the top of one, and a piece of cardboard underneath it. They were able to make surprisingly intricate models using just that, and they by no means were the first to make a machine using such motors, though the cardboard was a great touch.
*****
>>**/u/veive** When someone asks for help or posts a cool new print that no one has done before.

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**/u/xahk** Yes, you can 3D print a 3D printer. While I get the idea behind the joke, people have actually been replicating printers using other printers for about eleven years now, so it's less a joke and more the way a sizeable percentage of our user base got the machine they're currently using, or is part of the project they're currently working on. If printing printers sounds interesting to you, there are loads of resources online, and if you run into trouble, /r/3Dprinting is a great place to look for help, haha.
*****
>>**/u/veive** We do our best to make this sub a place that is friendly for people who are new to 3D printing.

"April 22nd, 2018 - /r/Melodica: The subreddit for all things melodica!",121,8e2th8,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/8e2th8/april_22nd_2018_rmelodica_the_subreddit_for_all/,0,"####/r/Melodica

**642** Melodicists *performing* for  **7 Years!** 

##So, what's a melodica?

The keyboard harmonica, commonly referred to as a melodica or clavietta (I will refer to it as a melodica), belongs to the free reed family of musical instruments. Instruments that use free reeds to produce sound do so by using air to vibrate a metal or synthetic reed mounted within a frame and tuned to a specific pitch. When playing the harmonica, the player blows air straight across the reeds. An accordion, on the other hand, uses a set of bellows to create the airflow. The melodica is slightly different. The instrument has series of keys laid out in the style of a piano keyboard. When the player presses a key while blowing into the mouthpiece, a hole opens allowing the air to flow across the appropriate reed.


##How to play

The nature of the melodica’s piano style keyboard makes it easy to use for anyone already familiar with the piano, unlike other woodwinds which require the player to learn special finger combinations. In addition, to this, the melodica is polyphonic (capable of playing several notes at once) whereas other single or double reed instruments like the clarinet and oboe respectively, are monophonic (only able to play one note at a time). The player can also control the dynamics of the instrument by blowing harder or softer into the mouthpiece.

Many melodicas have a long flexible mouth pipe, allowing the instrument to be played standing, while using only one hand to operate the keys, or sat down, using both hands like a keyboard.

##Brief History

Free reed instruments have existed for millennia. Earliest examples are likely to have been invented in South East Asia as far back as the Stone Age. The melodica as we know it today was invented in the 1950s by Hohner, though a precursor to the modern instrument can be traced back to 19th century Italy.

##Usage in music

The melodica is great for home and studio use. Its portable design also makes it ideal for taking with you on holiday, on tour, or just about anywhere you want to play music! For larger venues and recording, it can be amplified using a vocal mic. Some designs also feature a built-in pickup, though these are fairly rare. Melodicas have become popular ‘one-song-per-set’ instruments in pop music as well, lending variety and an unusual timbre to the occasional melodic line or solo. 

* Melodicas are commonly used in education, especially in Asia, due to their lightweight design and colorful appearance.
* Minimalist composer Steve Reich made use of the instrument in his 1966 piece, ""Melodica."" The composition comprises of a four-note motif which is set slowly out of phase by use of a tape loop.
* Since Reggae musician Augustus Pablo adopted the melodica in the 1970s, it has become popular in Jamaican Dub and Reggae bands.
* Paul Oscher of Muddy Waters is known for using one in live shows. He first recorded the instrument on the band’s 1971 album Live at Mr. Kelly’s.

##The subreddit

For 7 years /r/melodica has been discussing and sharing their love for the wonderful musical contraption, helping out those new to music or the instrument, and serving as a place to share pieces arranged and played on the melodica, or to tell of various exploits involving the melodica, like [asking someone to prom.](https://www.reddit.com/r/melodica/comments/82ad15/melodica_prom_proposal/)

Albeit small in size, the community of /r/melodica are always willing to answer your questions, give feedback on performances, and even recommend which Melodica to buy for players of all experience levels.

# Moderator Interview

>#1. Why did you join /r/melodica?

>>**/u/edzillion:**  I started learning Melodica and found the sub, which at the time was dead. The original mod had departed reddit, so I applied to take it over and was awarded the modship.

>###2. How did you discover the melodica?

>>**/u/edzillion:** Listening to Augustus Pablo and other reggae music; I loved the sound - especially with dub effects a la King Tubby but didn't know what the instrument was. Originally I thought it was some kind of harmonica but the internet set me straight. 

>###3. What are your plans for the sub in the future?

>>**/u/edzillion:** I think we would like to improve things by posting more tutorials and simple tabs for beginners. It is a good learning instrument since it is so cheap and portable. Maybe in future, and with a bigger community, we can do some more collaborative events like jam sessions or composition competitions. 

>###4.Anything else you'd like to add?

>>**/u/edzillion:** I must confess I never got that far with my learning, I hope to take it up again when I have more time, but for the moment the revolutions calls. The better we can make this sub the easier that will be ;)

Thanks for taking the time to answer some questions, /u/edzillion!

##It's not a toy, but a real instrument!

Due to the melodica's prominence in teaching children music, and being easily/cheaply mass produced, it has been ordinarily regarded as a toy since circa the 70's. Fortunately, musicians like the Melodica Men have taken it upon themselves to play the instrument wholeheartedly, while reviving the keyboard harmonica's image as a respected woodwind. However, in the wise words of Patrick Stump, ""Good music is good music, regardless of where it comes from. I think that's a really important thing to carry with you"" and I earnestly agree.

Even a ""toy"" can produce melodious music!

##Serious part here
Creepy Asterisks is a subreddit that shows people, usually neck beards, role playing with ""uncomfortable and unsolicited asterisk actions."" The unfortunate receivers of these actions act in very comedic ways and overall make this a comedy subs. From here i'd like to leave it to the mods to explain the subreddit as they did a great job.

>#1.Around when did this sub start to pick up a following? 

>>**deliteplays**  Well, there's a little bit of a backstory here. There was an incarnation of the sub (also called r/creepyasterisks) before the current one. Just when the sub was really catching on, the owner of the original sub very suddenly, dramatically, and mysteriously nuked his account and abandoned the sub. This resulted in quite an outcry. There were many rumors and stories about what had happened swirling around and being discussed in subs with similar content such as r/creepypms. Then, an alert and opportunistic fan of the original sub was able to gain ownership of the abandoned sub, and resurrected it. This would be our present Glorious Leader, u/Delite. Fortunately, the fans of the previous incarnation were still around, and were extremely happy to see the sub in operation again. So, here we are just a couple months later, and the sub is running well and gaining subscribers. We're really happy with the growth and progress.

>#2.What are some defining posts? 

>>**deliteplays**  https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyasterisks/comments/7sk65z/slaps_you_with_dck/ This would definitely be one, although it didn't get as much attention at the time.

>#3.Is it hard to manage this sub?

>>**deliteplays** At first it was kind of a clusterfuck. We had alot of mods all with different ideas of what the sub should be. It got rocky for a bit, to be sure. Once we established the rules and what kind of content we wanted in the sub, it got significantly easier to manage. We're still designing and redesigning, trying new things, etc. We rely on feedback from the community to help guide our development and decisions. We have great users who are very involved and conscious of the rules. They do a lot of self-moderating. They definitely let us know when something isn't agreeing with the rules and spirit of the sub.

>#4.Have you ever had any big complaints about the server from people who use dashing asterisks?

>>**deliteplays** I'm assuming you mean -doing this- instead of doing *this*? Ironically, this situation was just being discussed by us when we were alerted of your questions. We were discussing making a clarification in the rules that submissions don't need to literally have asterisks in the post to be acceptable in the sub. Some people use dashes instead, some use other punctuation, some don't use any punctuation at all - but the creepyasterisk-y RP is obvious and heavily implied. These are all acceptable in the sub, at the descretion of the mods, of course.

>#5.*Awoo*

>>**deliteplays** *gives you a wry smile, grabs you and brings your face close to mine OwO bulge grows signifying confidence*



If you have any other questions feel free to ask the moderators of the sub and I'd highly recommend joining their community!

Have you witnessed an event that caused a spectator(s) to go agasp? That is this subreddit, more specifically the spectator part, and not about the event itself. This is the subreddit for videos of people and/or animals reactions to weird or interesting events.

This is a subreddit that is easier to show than explain. [Like when this cat meets his tiger cousin](https://gfycat.com/OrderlyOrneryAurochs), or [the reaction of this horse after the mask is removed](https://i.redd.it/mmwdftppl4o01.gif). Another great one is this video of [these kids reactions to the easter bunny](https://i.imgur.com/Dqbyu3x.gif)

###Here is a short interview from the mods from /r/youseeingthisshit

>#Why did you join the subreddit?

>>**/u/conalfisher** I had just started to get into moderating; a few months before I had become a moderator of /r/SubredditOfTheDay (coincidentally enough), my first subreddit larger than 100 subscribers. After getting kicked out of r/EDM for now knowing how the hell to moderate properly (SROTD is mainly writing, not much regular moderating is involved), I started frequenting r/needamod. I saw an application form for this sub, which I knew decently well; I had been subbed to it since nearly the start of my Reddit account. So I applied, and managed to get in, where I managed to work out how to actually do moderating stuff.

>>**/u/steelbeamsdankmemes** I started the subreddit from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4cetah/you_seeing_this_shit/d1hoku3?context=2), and it didn't start growing rapidly until maybe a year later. It seemed to have a good theme, so I decided to make a subreddit dedicated to it.

>>**/u/fastjur** I saw it being created actually! I posted a couple of gifs and then messaged /u/steelbeamsdankmemes if he needed any help setting it up. He gladly accepted and I helped shaping the sub (I think at least)

>#What's moderating the sub like?

>>**/u/conalfisher** The sub has a rather high amount of submissions per day, so it can be hectic sometimes. Most of the time, I'm just removing reposts and posts by people who don't understand the sub (ie. ""Hey, look at this cool thing I saw!* posts). Still, it's pretty fun, and not terribly difficult. We get a fair amount of spam, which was a large problem a few months back, but we've since implemented some more spam filters and it's alright now. Overall, it's a fun sub to moderate, there are no major issues.

>>**/u/steelbeamsdankmemes** It's a little hectic, since a lot of people have different opinions about what constitutes a ""You seeing this shit?"" reaction. So we really got to pay attention and make sure it's conforming to the rules and theme of the sub. There's also a lot of reposting, since it's a niche reaction subreddit, but we do our best to limit them.

>>**/u/fastjur** Unfortunately it is a very 'niche' themed sub. There are a lot of gray area submissions, as I like to call them. Submissions that are hard to approve or remove, because they kinda fit and don't at the same time. I know this is something many users hate and we get quite some angry messages about them. But hey, we try!

>#What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**/u/conalfisher** [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/youseeingthisshit/comments/77u7wk/who_the_hell_are_you/)'s a classic, it's an excellent reaction all round. There's also [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/youseeingthisshit/comments/7py7gu/today_at_the_mlk_proclamation/) that I really like, generally most still images on the sub are worse than the GIFs, but that one is great.

>>**/u/steelbeamsdankmemes** The original:

 >>http://i.imgur.com/ObolcBf.gifv

 >>http://i.imgur.com/pqV0FXQ.jpg

 >>https://i.imgur.com/FHz7t2m.gifv

>>**/u/fastjur** My favourite posts are the kind of posts where the camera 'zooms' in to the face as well. This drastically increases the 'you seeing this shit' effect.

>#Anything else you want to add?

>>**/u/conalfisher** Shocked face ≠ ""you seeing this shit?"" reaction. That is all.

>>**/u/fastjur** Man I wish I had more time available right now. At the moment the other mods are doing almost all the work. Life kinda got in the way, but I still like it!

**86,908** readers for **8 years**!

## What is Social Anxiety?

From the sidebar:

```
[Social anxiety] is the fear of social situations that involve interaction with other people... [and] the fear and anxiety of being negatively judged and evaluated by other people. It is a pervasive disorder and causes anxiety and fear in most all areas of a person's life. It is chronic because it does not go away on its own.
```

I have had the Social Anxiety disorder. At times, I have been driven to suicidal thoughts as well as depression because of it. Social Anxiety is a very serious and very real threat, and I can tell you firsthand.

However, I am proud to say that I am no longer suicidal or depressed. I can go outside without watching my every motion in fear of criticism, and most of all, I can help *others*. How? /r/socialanxiety.

While I cannot attribute all of my successes so far solely to an internet group, /r/socialanxiety has really helped me to become more confident. Through this subreddit, I was able to meet other people with diverse backgrounds, interesting stories, and thoughtful discussion.

Normally, this would be the part where I tell you that I lived happily ever after and move on to the interview questions with the mods. However, this is not the end of *my* story. I still have social anxiety, and I do not know if it will ever go away. But I am very endowed to the /r/socialanxiety community for everything I have learned.

On /r/socialanxiety, you’ll find everything from successes to questions to memes to answers. The community is made up of so many amazing individuals, and the mod team is quick to respond to anything, including the questions I asked them about /r/socialanxiety.

> # **How did you get here?**

>> **VentralTegmentalArea:** I was a subscriber for a while and noticed some things that I thought could improve the sub at that time.  Messaged the mods and was added to the team.

>> **MuchRedditLessTime:** I found /r/SocialAnxiety by actually seeing the trending bar at the top of reddit and immediately subscribed as it's something that, whilst not terrible for me, is definitely something that affects me. After seeing a few spam-like posts I thought to send over a modmail offering to setup toolbox (a browser extension that allows for easier moderation) on the subreddit and to maybe assist with moderation. After a few hours I was added and put into place automod configuration, antispam measures, and removal reasons. It became apparent that a few more moderators were needed following the influx of users coming from the subreddit trending and being linked from elsewhere, so adding new mods was put high on the priorities too.

>> **MuffinMedic:** Found it through /r/Anxiety (shameless plug)

>> **Twilexis:** When Tom started the r/SocialAnxiety discord he asked me to help him out while it got off the ground. I ended up sticking around and helping it grow, and now I'm a subreddit mod.

> # **What is your personal vision for the subreddit?** 

>> **VentralTegmentalArea:** A place where people can find support, help, and info about social anxiety.  Social anxiety disorder is often called the disorder of missed opportunities.  I would hope the sub raises awareness in individuals who are suffering with social anxiety disorder that it is possible to cure it if treatment is sought, and to give the motivation to seek that treatment ASAP to live a fuller, happier life.  And of course, a place for those in the middle of social anxiety disorder to relate with one another and have at least some form of socialization.

>> **MuchRedditLessTime:** A safe place for people in need to get and share support, but also balanced with calm discussions on the topic and even a meme or two thrown in too. Somewhere you can post anything relevant without the constraints of title rules or post format guidelines, where it's okay to vent but stories of success are welcomed too. There's also a [/r/SocialAnxiety Discord](https://discord.gg/socialanxiety) which also welcomes more off-topic discussion as well as an extension of the topics discussed on the subreddit which I feel has built a really strong positive community. Weekly goals, evrything from depression to relationship advice, voice chat, and a dedicated channel to share success join the more offtopic channels for pictures and selfies, memes, gaming, and giveaways. To the surprise of some users the server is very active, and somewhere that despite the topic we encourage everyone to say hi!

>> **MuffinMedic:** I'd like to see more community events that help bring members of the community together.

>> **Twilexis:** To be like it is now, a caring environment for people who need to reach out and discuss any issues or successes they've had.

> # **What is moderating the subreddit like?** 

>> **VentralTegmentalArea:** It’s fairly easy to moderate the sub, as many who suffer from social anxiety are very afraid of doing the wrong thing socially and being negatively judged, even online.  They self moderate for the most part.

>> **MuchRedditLessTime:** Generally pretty calm as talk tends to stay full of positive advice. There's also very little guidelines as to post format etc so unless our civility rules are broken or the post is wildly offtopic the modqueue isn't normally that bad. As we're at the end of the day a support subreddit we inevitably have users at risk to self-harm or suicidal thoughts, where we try to provide advice on a case-by-case scenario. This is definitely the most stressful and difficult aspect to moderating this community however is definitely worth it even if you convince a single user to seek further help.

>> **MuffinMedic:** It's fun! Good team, great users, and even better bribes from an anonymous anxiety website you may or may not have seen on here.

>> **Twilexis:** Like VTA said, most people self-moderate for the most part. The community here is honestly pretty awesome.

> # **Anything else you would like to add?**

>> **VentralTegmentalArea:** The sub has nearly doubled its subscribers in the last year.

>> **MuchRedditLessTime:** I'd encourage anyone reading this who thinks they might have some form of social anxiety to check out the subreddit and Discord, even if mild and / or undiagnosed, as there's still a lot of support and advice availible. The subreddit (and especially Discord) tend to be very welcoming.

>> **MuffinMedic:** Muffins > Cupcakes. Dogs > Cats. Speaking of which, [here are some pics of my puppy](https://muffinmedic.net/beso/) (Yes, more shameless advertising).

>> **Twilexis:** Turtles are food, not friends.

This subreddit is a continuation of the Take care of my plant project. The creator of that project and his plant have been missing for around 3 months. This project is an automated plant watering system which is controlled by users votes. This project can (sadly) be viewed as something silly and extremely unnecessary as some people view it. However, I like to view it as people coming together to do something positive and collaborative. This is one of the few places on the internet in which people don't try to destroy what you have created because in many ways, it is their creation as well. The community wanted to live on but did not know in what way they could. I had been running a mimic of the take care of my plant project on a different app for 3 months. I created a subreddit named Take care of our plants in which anyone can upload their version of the original project hence the name take care of OUR plants. Each day the bot creates a voting post which contains the previous cycle's decisions and a pinned comment which keeps track of that days yes vs. no votes. The community keeps growing daily with around 200 subs at the time of writing this. This community is full of people who genuinely care about this project and the plants within it.

If you're like other standard sheeple, you follow signs.  Stop! Yield! Submit to Zorp the Surveyor! Or...other normal human things.
Anyway. 

Signs keep the people from doing dangerous things, like falling off cliffs or rebelling against the government.  What? 

This subreddit is a collection of signs people have found in the wild.  Unsafe work sites, dangerous hiking trails, gator farms. And there are signs found outside of Florida, too! ^Probably.

Such examples as [the state of the world](https://i.redd.it/8xiagxew84501.jpg), [threats to the second worst state](https://i.redd.it/n54zro3ltxc01.jpg), and [real talk from the Canadian Maritimes](https://i.redd.it/y99hth6xjmuz.jpg) show the true breadth of signs that can be found. 

The rules are pretty strict on submitting parody signs (2 of the 3 rules touch on this) so rest assured all signs *posted* are legit.  Check it out, and see the world through warning signs from the comfort of your own home. 

&nbsp;

Moderator /u/OceanCarlisle was kind enough to answer some questions about the sub. 


>#1. Why did you join the subreddit?  

>> I really like the idea of it. It's like mildlyinteresting for signs with a little death twist.

>#2. What's moderating the sub like?
>>Fairly simple. Not much spam recently mostly just have to take down a fair amount of reposts and signs that aren't scary.

>#3. What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?
>>[This recent one](https://imgur.com/a/jM987) I love because it shows the validity of the sign. Other than that I like the ones that use a stick figure to illustrate the danger, [like this other recent post](https://i.redd.it/inuubrv194n01.jpg).

Congratulations. Only TRUE SROTD readers that have been with us for 7 years could have gotten this far and defied my instructions. You may now pass.

*ahem*

/r/gatekeeping is for all the internet idiots that assume authority in filtering who **really** deserve to pass. Because after all, you can only make rules if you’re a 24 year old male that works in a car factory in Belize, right?

Unfortunately, there are **still** people out in the world who believe this with all their heart, which is good news for the rest of us, because what would our source of entertainment be otherwise?

Spend some time in the crevasses of /r/gatekeeping, and you’ll begin to notice that there /r/gatekeeping really fills a gap present in the tangle of stuff that is Reddit. You’ll see hints /r/iamverysmart and /r/choosingbeggars, with a slight hint of /r/murderedbywords.

We asked /u/stuffed02, the current head moderator over at /r/gatekeeping how he felt about gatekeeping. Heres what he said:


# 1. What is your personal definition of gatekeeping?

>> **stuffed02:** I believe Gatekeeping is pretty self explanatory. It’s when one person chooses who or what can be a part of a group. Such as when someone is deciding if you are truly smart if you meet certain criteria, or if ~~your~~ *you’re* only healthy if you run 10 miles a day. They are setting factors, with no reason, to limit who can belong in a certain clique.


# 2. How did you end up here?

>> **stuffed02:** I answered a mods needed post. I’ve loved the sub and saw an opportunity to give back, so I jumped on it.


# 3. What is it like to moderate /r/gatekeeping?

>> **stuffed02:** Gatekeeping is a solid community, people are usually kind to one another and we are a great team together. I’ve loved seeing the community bond made by these posts.


# 4. What is your favorite thing about the subreddit?

>> **stuffed02:** The content. We get a amazing posts, they are hilarious, or down right creepy. But whatever they may be, it gives me a good chuckle to read them!


# 5. What are some of your favorite posts on the subreddit?

>> **stuffed02:** 

>>> [A+](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatekeeping/comments/7vmlpz/a/)

>>> [Only 90s Cats Will Understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatekeeping/comments/89n552/cat/)

>>> (While my own favorite post is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatekeeping/comments/7um5q9/refreshing/?st=JFWQQ9VT&sh=2328e609), to each their own I guess. \^_\^)

**93,315** colour creators for **5 years!**

Is watching paint dry the most boring thing you can imagine? Luckily, looking at pictures of paint can be a rewarding experience.  Don't believe me? Over at r/unstirredpaint, those in the (apparently) booming paint creation industry prove that not all paint is as *dry* as drying paint.  

The oddly specific colours of paint you've selected for your new abode don't just grow on trees in perfect shades.  It takes time, effort, and probably some hallucinogenic drugs for specialists to customize and create the colour you picked blindly from a list of 40 000 identical-but-not-quite-identical colours.  In this subreddit, you can view the ""before"" half of ""before and after"" pictures, where the ""after"" is what makes guests comment ""Oh, wow, you guys painted? I don't think I've ever seen that exact shade of beige."" before averting their eyes and praying you won't show them the accent wall in the basement. 

What makes this subreddit even more unique is the fact that each photo of unstirred paint gets an interesting title.  Sure, you could find photos online of a can of paint called ""Plain Jane Purple"".  But want to see a can of paint dubbed [Angry Red-Head Berating a Hairy Jelly Bean](https://i.redd.it/yge2gj0vicj01.jpg)? How about [Blue Turkey](https://i.redd.it/g0t7436731j01.jpg)? Or the coup de grace, [Acorn or a Member of the Beatles?](https://i.redd.it/0x2mnkj2xvtz.jpg)

These gems, and many more, available only on [r/unstirredpaint](https://www.reddit.com/r/unstirredpaint/).  

With just three simple rules, [r/unstirredpaint](https://www.reddit.com/r/unstirredpaint/) is a goldmine of interesting photos.  Remember kids: Be nice. Post paint. Stirred paint is ok. 

>#1. Why did you join the subreddit?

>>**/u/Lizardbreath**  I felt like it was such a random subreddit and was blown away that it existed at all. Unstirred paint, is that even a thing? Once I learned what it was I wanted it in my life.



>##2. What's moderating the sub like?

>>**/u/Lizardbreath**  Fun! The /r/unstirredpaint community is great and has many playful and creative subscribers. People generally post original content and are very positive to each other.


>##3. What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>>**/u/Lizardbreath** 
 [Definitely paint tits.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unstirredpaint/comments/73hbg9/a_gallery_of_most_of_my_unstirred_paint_pictures/)

>#4. Anything else you want to add?

>>**/u/Lizardbreath** The universe is basically one giant can of unstirred paint.

Unless you've been living under a rock for the past ~11 years, you've probably played Team Fortress 2, and you've almost certainly have at least heard of it. /r/TF2 is Reddit's embodiment of TF2's legendarily active, friendly, comedic, talented, and welcoming community. On /r/TF2 you'll find discussion, [highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/88alpw/my_friend_had_one_of_the_best_surfs_ive_seen_to/) , screenshots, [artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/81mvft/blamo_sfmphotoshop/), and [high quality shitposts and memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6df53y/can_i_copy_your_homework/) . I'll leave it to /r/TF2 to tell you why the game itself deserves it's title as one of the greatest PC games of all time, but i'll say that whether you've never played the game before or you're coming back, the game and it's community will always give you a fun time.

For some people, TF2 and it's community is something that, even if they have stopped being involved in it, they have fond memories of and are proud to be part of it's history. It may even have changed their lives, even to the present day. Theres a reason why people say that once you play TF2 and embrace it's community, it never really leaves you. Even if you stop playing, you're going to return to it eventually in some way or another.

**287,022** mental sadists for **1 year**!



&nbsp;



/r/WatchPeopleDieinside is NOT an NSFW/L sub, don't worry. It is a sub for those moments caught on film where the person being filmed has the soul/will to live sucked out of them. Where one moment, they are happy, smiling, and then something happens, causing them to contemplate all their past decisions and future goals. [Here's] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleDieInside/comments/7bfkrb/pick_one/) an excellent example of it in action, if you don't understand.



We've all felt something at least a bit like that. Maybe it's 11:30AM, you're on the bus, going to campus for your final. You've been studying for this damn Chemistry exam all year, you could recite the periodic table off by heart by order of the atom's first ionisation energy, and could write a scientific paper on bond angles alone. You're ready for this. You reach campus, ready. You quickly go across the road over to the coffee shop, to pick up an expresso or five. God damnit you need this now, you had been following the ""sleep is for the weak"" schedule, as many do in uni. Eventually the clock turns 11:50, and you begin the long, arduous trek to the exam hall. I mean, it's only 150 metres away in actuality, but it sure doesn't fucking feel like that. You make your way into the crowd of students outside. As expected, they're all chatting away to eachother. You find your friend, and go to meet him, coffee in hand. He's talking to someone else. While listening in, you hear him utter ""So, how'd you find question 6?"" Confused, you ask him what he's talking about. He says ""yeah man, question 6, you know, that one about the anion-pi interactions?""


And then you realise it. You reach into your pocket, and clasp the timetable in your shaky hand. It couldn't be true, you tell yourself. After a little fumbling to get it out, you look at the time of the exam. 

**Begins: 08:30 - Ends: 11: 50**

Your friend repeats his question, with the look on his face becoming more concerned as you don't respond; hell, you didn't even hear him, all you hear is the ringing. Your smile and optimism are long gone. All you can think about is that big fat 10 grand you spent getting this damn degree, all down the toilet.




That's what this sub aims to encompass. When you can tell that someone else is feeling that exact same feeling. The dread, the embarrassment. While it won't usually be as extreme as that example provided above, the feeling will be close. Maybe it's when the person realises they [completely embarrassed themselves on TV] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleDieInside/comments/7jl9m6/roy_moore_spokesman_finds_out_you_dont_have_to/), or [realising you just messed up the most important day of someone's life] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleDieInside/comments/7i6baw/wedding_officiant_loses_the_ring_everybody_dies/). It's that shock that causes this to be entertaining. It's a form of morbid curiosity, really. It's a mix between /r/Cringe and /r/WellThatSucks, and it's amazing. I recommend everybody check this sub out, it's great.




> **1:  Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>> **RelayRider** at the time, there were bots that would create a sub anytime someone used a fake subreddit as a ""hashtag."" i was sitting in a hospital room with a dying relative, watching a sports event where the ref totally fucked up. someone posted about it in r/watchpeopledie, but it was removed as nobody actually died. i made a stoopid(tm) comment about maybe they should have posted in r/watchpeopledieINSIDE, then went ahead and created the sub before the bots did.

>> **LANA_WHAT_DangerZone** I'll be honest with you... a friend of mine messaged me asking if I'd like to be modded here, and I said yes.

> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **RelayRider** ignoring a lot of reports. people does not equal human. just ask the giant doggo sitting on my feet right now.

>> **LANA_WHAT_DangerZone** Moderating the sub is pretty cool, it has its ups and downs. Nothing really special though, it's just your run-of-the-mill subreddit.

> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **RelayRider** In general, bad ref calls or when goalies miss really obvious shots (especially if in brasil and futbol, because...)

>>in specific, this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleDieInside/comments/7jl9m6/roy_moore_spokesman_finds_out_you_dont_have_to/


>> **LANA_WHAT_DangerZone** Probably this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleDieInside/comments/7pi8pm/is_this_happening/. The look on the kid's face is priceless!

> **4: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **RelayRider** Where we're going we don't need roads... i mean plans

>> **LANA_WHAT_DangerZone** Honestly, we don't have any plans for this sub in the future.

> **5: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **RelayRider** Real and imaginary numbers, but i'm told that's mathematically infeasible

>> **LANA_WHAT_DangerZone** You can easily tell what gender an ant is by putting it in water. If it sinks, it's a girl ant. If it floats, it's buoyant. Also, subscribe to r/chickengifs, r/foxgifs, r/goatgifs, r/mousegifs, r/rabbitgifs, and r/sealifegifs.

You know in games or movies when you find an odd little secret that someone intentionally left behind? Something that can be easily overlooked if you aren't paying attention or if you aren't looking in the right place?

/r/IRLEasterEggs is a place for those things either corny or cool, you find in real life. Whether you're exploring and find a strange sculpture in the exposed woodlands or maybe you're walking in the city and find a beautiful drawing or painting just smeared on the wall in the back. This is a place to share all those little secrets you find out in the world (or the internet, we're not really ones to judge). Generally, they are little gems in a place that is somewhat unexpected, not so much the rather massive things sometimes on display.

We are at the intersection of media and reality. Join us when you are ready to exploit some glitches, make your way into some seemingly unmapped areas, and find the Easter eggs left for us in real life.

**23,394** readers *laughing* for  **2 months**

NHGW was a subreddit, [started from a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/7ozylb/not_only_riamverysmart_but_also_rthathappened/dsdlrol/) on /r/IamVerySmart and has since grown from a small knit community laughing their asses off to a large community laughing their asses off even more than before. To further expand on the community, I can say with full truth that it is amazing. The mods praised it frequently during the interview.

NHGW is based on pictures of people who don't understand that girls don't confine to their stereotypes. This can range from [being a brony and getting all the ladies](https://www.reddit.com/r/NotHowGirlsWork/comments/7p2ybd/when_you_become_a_brony_girls_will_basically_run/) to being an [expert in birth giving](https://www.reddit.com/r/NotHowGirlsWork/comments/808lvr/the_clitoris_makes_babies/). 

What makes this subreddit worth the feature is how it's handled by the community and what the subreddit is. IT brought together a group of people that were looking for these types of posts and gathered all that comedy into one place. With support from other subreddits it has become an insanely fast growing subreddit ith positive intentions.

>##1.Is /r/nothowgirlswork a branch from /r/neckbeards?
    
>>**Occlpv2**  NotHowGirlsWork, although similar, is not actually a branch from /r/neckbeards. It actually began on a thread on /r/iamverysmart, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/7ozylb/not_only_riamverysmart_but_also_rthathappened/dsdlrol/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=NotHowGirlsWork&utm_content=t5_adf18)!
    
>##2.How does it feel to have such a large a growing subreddit? 

>>**Occlpv2**  The growth has felt amazing, we're delighted so many people enjoy our sub. When we began three months ago, we got 9,000 subscribers in the first 4 days, and Kind shout-outs from /r/iamverysmart and /r/ihavesex helped us sustain that growth. I think I speak for everyone in saying that we're honoured by the support.

>##3.Do some posts get too misogynistic for the subreddit?

>>**Occlpv2**  Never, the submitters have been great and we appreciate all of them! very few have been removed, and none for misogyny.

>##4.Has brigading ever been an issue?

>>**Occlpv2** Again, we're blessed with a great core subscriber base, brigading hasn't been an issue for us.

I'd like to thank Occlpv for answering the interview questions and allowing me to feature this subreddit.

r/SquaredCircle is a subreddi- *cough* THE subreddit for everything wrestling related. While each of the bigger companies have subreddits of their own, this one combines them all, plus as many indie wrestling companies as they can bring to the table. April 8th is a special day for this sub, because the biggest wrestling show of the year, WRESTLEMANIA, falls on that date. [Historic news](https://out.reddit.com/t3_85ixvh?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wwe.com%2Fworldwide%2Farticle%2Fseven-championship-matches-featured-at-greatest-royal-rumble-event-april-2018&token=AQAAGPuvWhEoSb10_rWivbvKBGr34PxKj5pz746dd5tDNifaLtBt&app_name=reddit.com), [showerthoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/85ft56/fun_fact_no_champion_has_received_a_rematch_since/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=SquaredCircle), and [incredible memories](https://out.reddit.com/t3_85dizy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FNSMu_VU_OOg%2F&token=AQAAGPuvWnb6ZqMWjK8SgwVUyVHUM0Eu-djl2nR8R-ffMliKL-WB&app_name=reddit.com) alike share a home in this place. And not only is this is most popular wrestling sub of all time, it is the 15th most active sub on Reddit! ""Beating out r/pcmasterrace, r/til, and r/anime!""

The mods are tasked with the incredible job of handling this place, due to the immense population. Just one of their responsibilities is to put up a live discussion thread before every PPV, and taking down spam and spoilers that follow. And believe me, there is more than enough of that to go around. But what better way to wrap up Wrestlemania week with the prime wrestling subreddit being the subreddit of the day?

Murdered by words is the prime place for the perfect comeback. Not only will your comebacks sting ~~for the first time ever~~, they will also be capable of MURRRDAHHHH! Be careful, though, because the people here won't hesitate to turn the tables on each other when need be. And nothing is off limits- except political *burns* and whatever the ~~terrible, no-good, very bad~~ rules tell you.

#Why does someone need to visit this sub?

**Jackson:** This sub is for the people who love seeing others absolutely destroyed. These people are the ones that say things so utterly ridiculous that you wonder how they've made it this far. Here, we showcase the people who murdered them because of this- with words.

**Him999:** Our subreddit is for those who want to read the deconstruction, destruction and/or murder of any given person for either a comment they make or an argument they have. There is quality content to be had for all walks of life.

**Dr-Pepper:** I'm a new mod, so the others might have better answers, but r/MurderedByWords is for anyone looking to have a quick laugh at someone else's expense by seeing them absolutely annihilated by words. Whether that's by a witty, well timed burn or an absolute massacre - this sub has it all. I think everyone can find enjoyment in this sub which is something a lot of subs can't say for themselves. It's a niche sub for sure, but who say's that has to a bad thing? 

**Zarquon:** Murdered By Words is exactly what it says on the tin: a place to see people verbally obliterated after they say something stupid. We've also (sort of) recently started allowing burns, which are quick, witty replies that leave the recipient feeling a bit of staircase wit. If that's your bag, this is where to come.

**XOR:** Have you ever seen a long winded comment by someone that is clearly wrong? Someone were you felt like you have to punch them in the face for all that bullshit they just wrote? But of course you couldn't because first of all it's the internet and secondly violence is not really helpful. But what you can do is destroy them with words: Counter every single point they made, call them out on their bullshit, and make them really feel but with words. **If that's what you like to see you need to visit r/murderedbywords.**

**Umbresp:** Nobody *needs* to visit this sub per se, but I really think that this is a great place. I first came here from a comment in an r/all frontpage post and immediately subbed because I wanted to see how people were able to gain the verbal upper hand through smart plays. Now I can murder all my friends

**Patrick:** Our top posts of all time are pretty great. We've got some hidden gems, and a community that cares about the subreddit, even if they might not all agree with each other.

#What are some of your favorite posts on the subreddit?

**Jackson:** My favorite post would have to be [this one,](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/81bsfo/law_professors_response_to_blm_shirt_complaint/) where a law professor absolutely *destroys* students who complained about him wearing a BLM shirt. It didn't get nearly as popular as the rest, but it is absolutely amazing.

**Him999:** We are actually compiling a list of our favorite murders on the subreddit. There is a LOT of content to choose from. 

**Dr-Pepper:** My favorite post that I have seen so far has to be [the war on the burrito maker](‭https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/86zcim/tumblr_user_declares_war_on_burrito_maker/‬) post. It's the first time I've read through a post and thought, ""wow he got murdered"" since I became a mod. Posts like that are what this sub was founded on and it's posts like that one that really brings the sub back to it's roots. 

**Zarquon:** Here's a few of my personal favorites. [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7pftrd/freed_slaves_response_to_former_masters_plea_for/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7t55ak/science_101_murder/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7crxl8/a_classic/)

**XOR:** [The case of the burrito murder](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/86zcim/tumblr_user_declares_war_on_burrito_maker/), [Being a political expert](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7itpzn/famous_musician_kills_man_in_broad_daylight/), and [They try to poison us!1!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7t55ak/science_101_murder/)

**Umbresp:** [No Problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7xqm3n/no_problem/?st=JF9LDWKV&sh=4338f2b2), [People with depression do not need a doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7qda4b/people_with_depression_do_not_need_a_doctor/?st=JF9LFJ9N&sh=19f5360e), and [Butterfingers shows no mercy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7vci4x/butterfingers_shows_no_mercy/?st=JF9LH1JP&sh=f0751202)

**Patrick:** [This one](https://youtu.be/2-d4otHE-YI)

#What are your plans for the sub in the future?

**Jackson:** Going back in time. Our quality has, quite frankly, gone downhill. We're starting a gradual shift in which we are trying to nudge users to post more murders and less burns. We want this sub to be the place for high-quality content, and hopefully some sub will come in to fill the gaps.

**Him999:** We have a lot of plans. We successfully implemented our transparency action plan. Our modlogs are open to the public and our modtalks are open to view as well. Some of our next plans. We are continuing to strive for the best content we can while maintaining a balance with the community's broader interests and opinions. This is one of our biggest goals. We will be compiling a list of exemplary posts for users to reference, the good and the bad, the best and the worst. We hope to some time soon implement posts of the week or month, we are pretty excited about that. One of the newer moderators from the last round of applications came up with that.

**Dr-Pepper:** As I've stated, I've only been a mod for about 10 days haha, so a lot of the other mods I'm sure will have better responses on this than myself. But since my time here we've already banned political themed burns and there has been lots of talks about other ways to make the sub even better than it is now. Hopefully we can have more posts like the burrito post I linked to in the last question, because I feel like that really shows exactly how the sub is suppose to be. I'm excited to be a part of it's growth firsthand and help the sub (hopefully) continue to prosper.

**Zarquon:** One thing that's been a hot topic is getting the subreddit back to its quality roots. Ever since we started getting big, we've experienced a small flood of low quality content that just isn't right for the subreddit. Bringing in additional moderators has improved things quite a bit, and I'm pretty sure that /u/xor50 doesn't sleep with how quickly he demolishes the mod queue. We hope to keep bringing Murders and Burns to Reddit with our usual flair. Expect better quality content in the future, now with 95% less politics and 100% more heat.

**XOR:** Because I'm pretty new I'm not sure how much I can say regarding this question, but one topic we're talking a lot about is the quality of the submissions and where the fine line between a good and a bad post is. I think we could be more consistent with enforcing our rules and filtering out the bad stuff but we also have some plans to promote the really good stuff.

**Umbresp:** We've just began disallowing political *burns*. I've yet to see how that turns out. I'm pretty new, though, so I'll just go along with whatever the more experienced moderators say.

**Patrick:** Bring it back to its roots. This means concise, well-put, brutal beatdowns with words.

#If you could describe this sub in three words, what would they be?

**Jackson:** Death by Diction. (Aren't all of us bad at this part)

**Him999:** Murders by words. I'm bad at this part.

**Dr-Pepper:** Execution by language. Idk. I'm also bad at this part. Wrecked by words? Something like that. The title is relatively self explanatory and I'm relatively uncreative.

**Zarquon:** Murders by Design

**XOR:** Murdered by words? I guess that's not what you wanted to hear? Maybe something like *killed with arguments?*

**Umbresp:** killed by speech?

**Patrick:** What growing pains? (Kidding). I can't think of any, I think the subreddit name sort of speaks for itself.

#Anything else you want to add?

**Jackson:** While we do maintain somewhat strict posting requirements, we're actually quite fun to talk to. We have a whole discord server that we use to char with members of our community, and we'd love to hear from you there. We take user input *very seriousely*, so if you have any suggestions, we'd love to hear them.

**Him999:** Our subreddit is complex in definition. That is one of the most wonderful parts of it. We have gone through some rough patches but the community is strong and constantly on the lookout for great content and seems to understand us when we talk to them about real issues. Our moderating team has become top notch this past month. We have on-boarded some wonderful people who have brought great ideas to the table as well as helped take some of the load off of other mods. We are open to discussion and always happy to talk to members of the community about anything from their favorite posts, general conversation, or serious concerns.

**Dr-Pepper:** Come check us out! We're always thirsting for more murders and burns. Don't be afraid to post or even just participate in the comments. We're a fun sub and our mod team is ~~actually a bunch of really lame nazis~~ pretty cool as well! The sub is about having a good laugh so come enjoy it with us!

**Zarquon:** I have occasionally abused the ability to sticky a comment for the sake of comedy. Also, god damn it Pepper, ""execution by language"" is way better than what I put 

**XOR:** Please read the rules before you submit and please report posts that break these rules. Thanks!

**Umbresp:** I removed a post once and the removal comment got 11 upvotes. I was really proud. 

**Patrick:** We've had some growing pains lately but I really feel like we're bouncing back, and this subreddit is about to reach the place it needs to be for it to be considered great.

Visiting r/Antiquememes is like lifting off the drain cover in the shower and seeing all the shit that has washed down and collected there over the years. Only it isn't goop, hair and unexplainable matter it's memes...

r/Antiquememes is a one year old community dedicated to the golden era of memes 2000-2012. Right now we have about 3.8k subs and a pretty steady stream of content. We are the right place to go and dump your old memefolders. Thats it, pretty simple concept really!

We also hade an article written about our sub by Vice that might be interesting to read: https://www.google.se/amp/s/motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/j55mkb/heres-where-memes-go-when-the-dank-wears-off

Malicious Compliance. Where do I begin? The best way to piss off your boss without breaking any of the rules is by being malicious. This subreddit is dedicated to the maliciousness of these people who felt the need to retaliate against people who were annoying, or bad employers, or anyone who needs a good old dose of revenge. The best part? Reading thousands of stories about people who want to punish them but they can't! Gotta love this community. 

---

In order to give you the full scoop, I have asked /u/Not_An_Ambulance here some questions on the subreddit. Hopefully he complies peacefully.

#Why does someone need to visit this sub?

**Ambulance:** I think our sub is about reading fun stories more than anything else. I think people need to visit because the theme is fairly compelling. We are (mostly) true stories about people following the rules with the intention of getting something over on someone. Sometimes it's the employee one upping their evil boss. Sometimes it's a parent flaunting their child's stupid school rules. For some reason it's just always a compelling read. 

#What are some of your favorite posts on the subreddit?

**Ambulance:** [School District doesn't allow Halloween costumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/5aewsy/school_district_doesnt_allow_halloween_costumes/), [Can't you unload around me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/7iv9ap/cant_you_just_unload_around_me/), and [The light said GO, so I went](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/7d4p7k/light_said_go_so_i_went/).

#What are your plans for the sub in the future?

**Ambulance:** I mean, mostly just run it the way it has been. We need new css, tweaks to our automoderator, probably a custom bot, and a new moderator or two.

#If you could describe this sub in three words, what would they be?

**Ambulance:** Malicious Compliance Subreddit

#Anything else you want to add?

**Ambulance:** I think anyone visiting should take note that we have a rule against discussing if a story is true or not. It’s there because it really takes some fun out if the comment section is just people calling the author a liar. It also discourages people from sharing their true stories and we have had a few people delete from harassment. Fundamentally we’re an entertainment subreddit.

r/CertainlyNotAliens is a subreddit kind of like r/totallynotrobots, but for people who aren't aliens! If you're the type of person who knows a lot about aliens, but you're an Earth person, come on down to this sub.

We've got lots to do here! We love to eat pizza, paint our nails, listen to hip-hop, ~~vivisect live members of primitive planets,~~ and be cool! It's a hangout for humans, and not aliens!

So, come on down to r/certainlynotaliens and have the time of your ~~flargh cycle~~ life!

Ever been stiffed out of a job, raise, or promotion, or really anything? Ever had somebody do you wrong? Well look no further, because /r/ProRevenge is the perfect sub for you! This place has some of the funniest stories of revenge that also made me cringe and cry on the inside. Look at these people the wrong way and they will do everything in their power to make your lives miserable. But these stories always satisfy the intended purpose, because at the end, the hunter becomes the hunted. From [shutting down bullies](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/84i54g/bully_from_my_past_decides_to_show_up_and_talk/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=ProRevenge) to [fighting back after a shitty bonus](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/7yy4gf/you_give_me_a_poor_raise_and_bonus_i_take_away/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=ProRevenge), r/ProRevenge is your one-stop shop for everything you need to make things right- the hard way of course.

"April 2nd, 2018 - /r/FreeGameFindings: Pirate bay, but legal",182,88yrkt,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/88yrkt/april_2nd_2018_rfreegamefindings_pirate_bay_but/,14,"####/r/FreeGameFindings

**53,835** Finders searching for  **4 Years!** 

/r/FreeGameFindings is a subreddit that I like to call the legal pirate bay. FreeGameFindings is a subreddit that has over 50 thousand users come together and search far and wide to notify the users about the free games being offered. These range from the famous [Payday 2's free release,](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/6g2wqb/steam_game_payday_2/) [DiRT 3's free release,](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/5c9arg/steam_game_dirt_3_complete_edition/) [and Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag's Free Release](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/7j2cbb/uplay_game_assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/)

What sets this subreddit apart from other free game subreddits is its community. Not only does it have at least 3 posts a week for free games, but it has an active comments section on each post. [Just look at this!](https://imgur.com/gallery/lIbGL) Along with an active comments section they also have 6 moderators which help with the posts. I took this chance to ask a few of them and specifically the creator a few questions!

>##For the owner: Why did you create this subreddit, did you expect AAA titles to come and how do you feel about the mods?

>>**StOoPiD_U**  I liked seeing the occasional post about free items on a few subreddits I had followed at the time, but noticed they would get buried by other things at the time. I wanted to make something like those other subreddits but exclusively for free games that are kept forever!

>>I'm very satisfied with /r/FGF! It's been fantastic to work on this place for the past few years. From start to now it's been a blast! For the past year or so, changes to Valve's own policies have resulted in a slow down to giveaways from Steam, which were a major part of the subreddit. We're still going strong, but the slowdown is noticeable.

>>Our mod team and community are just lovely! /u/Trislar has been huge for tons of front and back end stuff with everything here. /u/MetallicMan has been saving my ass from poor CSS work that I'd do. He's helped with all of that so much! /u/Glockwise /u/Surpex and /u/Nemetona do so much front end with tons of stuff. They take care of a lot of flairing and post approval stuff. Huge part of /r/FGF!

>##What are your main duties for the sub?

>>**Surpex**  My main duties are to make sure that posts conform to the sub-wide formatting structure we have. An easy second is to flair things depending on their status, or game type.

>>**Glockwise** A very vanilla answer, enforcing rules. Longer answer: checking reports, cleaning modqueue, reviewing user reports, marking expired giveaways. Anything to help our head mod. Nothing different from most subs I believe.

>##What kinds of posts do you have to delete?

>>**Surpex**  The vast majority of posts that I have to delete are duplicates of other things already posted. Our user base is pretty good about not being toxic, so that isn't a huge concern.

>>**Glockwise** Like a lot of subreddits, we have the rules tidily written in the sidebar. When a post somehow passed our automoderator, it's our task to review them manually. Comments are a bit trickier since it's hard to track all of them. Reports from users are really useful here.

>##What are your favorite posts?

>>**Surpex**  My favorite posts are giveaways that happen directly on Steam itself. Most of the time when Steam gives away a game, it's a pretty well known one and our community reacts in a very positive way.

>>**Glockwise** When big name publishers or storefront putting up their games for free. Just look at https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/top/ and prepare to get jelly not subscribing to our sub sooner.

Overall I'd give this subreddit a B for it's frequent posts, good moderators and very friendly owner. In the ned though a lot of the games are very random, some very bad. On the other hand you get good games pretty frequently and it leaves you with a full steam library!

**144,294** racists for **4** years!

Are you tired of all the inferior races constantly thinking they have a place on Reddit? Are you superior but others can’t seem to take a hint? Well, this subreddit is for you. 

[/r/ExtremeMegaRascist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald) is a tight-knit community of like-minded people. We accept anyone and everyone (as long as you’re superior). We offer a haven for the superior race from all the unfortunate toxicity in the majority of Reddit.

The intent of [/r/ExtremeMegaRascist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald) is to provide the master race with a sense of security and purity for being superior. Our team of moderators constantly monitor and make changes to prevent any inferiors.

Here’s what a [/r/ExtremeMegaRascist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald) mod answered when asked them about the subreddit:

> # 1. How do you feel about some of the complaints your subreddit has received?


>> **Mod** I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Welcome to r/assholedesign, where the people here give you a very thorough list of exactly what NOT to do. There are lots of dumbass, or just ass, things in general people do to make their products even worse. Things like [bad website setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/85r8py/theres_no_continue_with_website_option/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=assholedesign), [ripoffs of Lays,](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/85s9gb/theres_so_much_space_left_in_this_packet_that_you/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=assholedesign) or [attempts to hang onto customers](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/85tgua/emails_unsubscribe_link_uses_a_font_thats_the/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=assholedesign) can result in [loss of business](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/85k0ov/easy_way_to_get_your_app_uninstalled/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=assholedesign) and eventually, the perfect subreddit. DIYers, take notes. r/assholedesign is here. And so is their head mod, /r/TestZero, and u/supremecrafters to answer some questions. 

* What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?
    * **Zero:** Some of my favorites are the ones that make me wish the people designing the ads could put their powers to good use. Some of these posts are so clever it makes me think ""Why are you wasting your time with advertising? You should be working at NASA""

* If you could describe this sub in three words, what would they be?
    * **Zero:** Assholes be warned
    * **Supremecrafters:** Asylum from Assholery

Despite the clear assholery, the mods have a goal of listening to the community and keeping things friendly and light-hearted.

**710** in the WIR Galaxy for **3 years!**

WIR just isn't your normal competitive subreddit. While the many, many, MANY, characters here compete for the chance to hold the WIR World Championship, they take those characters and make the best story they can out of them. Every week they have a show they call 'House Party', which gives us matches, heated exchanges, and advances stories which pay off at each monthly iPPV. Members can resolve their stories in two ways: compete to see who has the best promo or decide what the outcome will be. Different people write the matches, with every person having their own style of a match. This place has been very organized throughout its existence, making it that much easier to run. 

---

Before I continue, let me talk with some of the people who run the sub, the mods. I will be interviewing three people. They will be Maverick (u/MAIsauce), Lucy (u/TheBardLucian), and Miles Alpha (u/Syckez)

#Why does someone need to visit this sub?
    
**Maverick:** Because we're a close-knit group that creates some very interesting, funny, and dramatic storylines and characters. Whether you read or choose to participate, WiR is a great place to be a part of.
    
**Lucy:** I'd say the subreddit, despite its many flaws, is above all a safe haven for people who not only love pro wrestling but also love telling stories. The sub is worth visiting because it's a look into the stories the fans of pro wrestling are interested in seeing. It's also a good place to have a laugh at the more absurd parts of wrestling. It's equal parts satire and creative tribute to something we all hold very dear.
    
 **Alpha:** I think WiR is a super unique sub, that you really can't find anywhere else. It completely revolutionized the traditional e-fed, and it's way easier to navigate, way easier to understand, and a lot more fun than so many of those forum-based e-feds. WiR is basically just a big collaborative writing project between a bunch of friends who like wrestling, which I think is a very unique idea for Reddit, but the layout is perfect for us. So, if you like wrestling and friends, WiR is a great sub.

#What is your most favorite moment in this sub?
    
**Maverick:** Hmm. Subjectively speaking, probably my character, Maverick, winning the WiR World Title. Maverick had been in a storyline slump a few months prior, so it was really awesome to have him win the main prize.
    
**Lucy:** Hmmm. That's actually really hard. I'll always hold dear Brodie winning the big one for obvious reasons. But I think the best, most genuinely uplifting moment has to be Los Chongas winning the tag belts in Mexico. It was ridiculous but it was fucking wonderful!
    
**Alpha:** My character in WIR, Miles, was entered into this rookie tournament when he was set to debut. I didn't know many people in WiR yet but I had two close friends named Joey and Nova. The three of us basically made sure I won the tournament, by completely screwing over my competitors in every match, and that's how we formed our infamous stable, the Young Cardinals. So yeah, I think that moment of winning the rookie tournament with my friends, and quickly becoming the most hated person would have to be my favorite.

#What are your plans for the sub in the future?
    
**Maverick:** I want to work with the community to make 2018 the best year ever for WIR. SSDY, our first big event this year, was a massive success, and I'm looking to keep that same quality throughout the year. 
    
**Lucy:** To be honest, I don't do much in regards to planning on the sub. That's mostly on whoever is booking (Mav at the moment). I tend to come on and do standard moderation duties (deleting posts that aren't relevant to the sub, responding to mod mail about people wanting to join, banning users on the rare occasion the need arises). I also help with posters and other graphics for the sub. So I suppose the extent of my future planning for the sub is keeping it on topic and pretty.
    
**Alpha:** I think the biggest thing we need to work on is expanding the size of the sub. More people with characters means more people writing matches, and it means higher quality content. I think we need as many writers as possible and recruiting some more people could really help in that regard.

#If you could describe this sub in three words, what would they be?
    
**Maverick:** Fun. Wierd. Community.
    
**Lucy:** Wrestling. Is. Reddit
    
**Alpha:** Fake, Fake, Wrestling

#Anything else you want to add?
    
**Maverick:** Not much, other than Wrestling is awesome.
    
**Lucy:** Nope. Glad to help.
    
**Alpha:** I'll just add that our discord server is always super active, and has a lot of cool people taking part. So if anyone is interested in meeting some cool peeps the discord is a good place to do it.

"March 28th, 2018 - /r/stopadvertising: A protest movement to get advertisers to pull ads from offensive subreddits",230,87rb9u,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/87rb9u/march_28th_2018_rstopadvertising_a_protest/,189,"####/r/stopadvertising 

**4,195** protesters for **1 month!**

Here is a community dedicated to getting reddit to remove subreddits that allow hate speech by hitting the site where it hurts, right in the wallet by getting advertisers to pull ads. [It works like this](https://i.redd.it/i1uuzfxkhdd01.png): Find a post on reddit that is hateful, promotes violence, or is otherwise offensive to reasonable people. Take a screenshot that includes the ads being run on that page. Forward that screenshot to the advertiser to show them what they are sponsoring. 

Here's an example: [UncensoredNews calls for black people to return to Africa \(Sponsored by AMC's The Walking Dead\).](https://imgur.com/pJmi6st.jpg) [It should be noted that UncensoredNews has since been banned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/843z85/why_was_the_uncensorednews_subreddit_banned/) That's the real goal of /r/stopadvertising. Not to cost reddit money, but to see communities that promote hate get removed from the site. 

I can spend a lot of time going over more examples here. Or I can just let the mods tell you about their sub in their own words. I am going to do the latter. I spoke with /r/stopadvertising's top mod, /u/LDHolliday, and he had a lot to say.

># Tell us about your mission statement. What is the change you want to see happen?
 
 
>>It’s really simple. And that means I need a few paragraphs to explain it. We think that in a place built and maintained by its users for its users, we shouldn’t have to feel threatened or harassed or embarassed by what’s here. That hateful, dangerous ideologies shouldn’t be given a safe haven. Now let me explain why and the background to that.
 
>>I think of reddit like a public forum, which it is, it’s a public place. Well, in real life, off the internet you can’t walk into times square and shout “Fucking muslims” or “HAHA KILL THE KIKES” without either getting the shit beat out of you or arrested for inciting violence. But somehow here on Reddit you can? Why, because it’s the internet? That’s asinine.  Why should moderators like myself or other subreddits have to be worried that we we will be doxxed and sent death threats from a specific community here? That’s not just asinine, that’s fucked!
 
>>You know, if you look back a few years on Reddit, right around the time Ellen Pao was CEO, you’ll note there was a serious contention just like now. There was a debate that existed over whether places such as /r/fatpeoplehate deserved to have a place on Reddit. At the time, it seemed like this big debate and that freedom of speech was being offended in some way. People freaked out so fucking hard, that it was used as a pretext to fire Pao. And now, it’s not, now ask most anyone and we all can nod and say “Yeah that was pretty fucked.” You’ll get some people that mumble “Oh it was just a bunch of jokes” “Oh it’s the internet” but find me someone that truly believes wholeheartedly a subreddit dedicated to hating fat people deserves a free and open forum? Actually, I’m almost sure you’ll get a volunteer for that one so don’t, but I’m sure you get the point.
 
>>But, if you look at where we’re sitting now, it’s at a strikingly similar crossroad except this time it’s not just online bullying. Real people have died as a result of these ideological safe havens. Heather Heyer, a young woman who attended a rally to fight back against literal Nazi’s was run over and killed by a man who believed so violently in the beliefs being perpetuated here, beliefs that time and time again are being backed by calls for violence, that he drove his car into a crowd injuring a dozen or more and killing a woman. That’s a bodycount. That’s a real physical body count that can be attributed to an ideology that is being fostered right here on reddit.
 
>>That’s dangerous, and it’s gotten to the point where we don’t even need to explain ourselves on why WE believe it. Because now even the Admins dislike having TD on the site. Reddit spent time and money on altering their own frontpage algorithm just to filter out t_d. The intelligence community in the U.S has put out reports demonstrating why and how T_D has been used as a platform for propaganda! Now we’re not just talking about being racist, now we’re talking about a public forum being used to spread disinformation.
 
>>That’s exactly why we’re here. Because of every reason listed above, and the worst part is, that’s just T_D. That’s not even talking about the rest of the stains on reddit causing these issues.
 
># Do you feel a conflict between loving reddit and trying to get advertisers to leave the platform?
 
>>Nothing could be further from the truth. I’ve got a full time job, I have a relationship to maintain and hobbies I like to do. This movement we’re trying to propel is entirely fueled by my love for reddits memes, low effort content and the fact that /r/prequelmemes can somehow find content from the same scene but in 42 different ways. And the same goes for the rest of the moderators here, we all have lives to live but we love reddit. We use reddit day in and day out. It’s tagline is “front page of the internet” and that’s exactly right. You can’t find me another site like this that can satisfy my curiosity for any given topic. When I’m searching for something on google, I add Reddit at the end like a goddamn suffix. So no, I feel no conflict in this movement.
 
>>We’re trying to fix reddit, not kill it. I want a reddit back where things feel right again.
 
>#Have you butted heads with Reddit admins?
 
>>Not until [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopadvertising/comments/85w3g6/like_taylor_always_said_look_what_you_made_me_do/), honestly. Which I’m sure might have had something to do with us becoming a subject of attention. The Reddit Admins either through being unaware of our presence (Difficult to do with the attention we have gained from advertisers) or restraint have up until this point not reacted at all to our methods. I attribute that to the fact that we haven’t broken ToS and we have operated well within guidelines. In fact, it wasn’t until a user today posted a submission that was somewhat misleading that they stepped in and said “Hey, don’t fuck this up.”
 
>>I can’t really comment much on what the whole situation means or even on the relationship between us and the reddit admins. There has been almost zero communication entirely. But we’re working on it. I’m just glad Senpai finally reached out.
 
 
>#What are your biggest issues with moderating the sub?
 
>>Getting it right. Understanding the limit of our purpose and understanding the danger of our own ideas. Moderating is easy, but understanding why all this is going on is difficult to make heads or tails of.
 
>>Something that our critics are absolutely correct to question about us is “Why do you get to decide what hate is” and I’ve answered that before but I still consider it every single day. The answer is because we said so, no one gave us that authority. We aren’t esteemed philosophers, or high ranking government officials or high members of faith circles. My moral authority isn’t any more powerful than the next person. My moral authority is probably weaker than my cats and he doesn’t have a lot of moral authority. But that doesn’t mean I can’t say what I believe is right or wrong.
 
>>I trust that the rest of Reddit, the people, will make that decision for us. All I did was start a sub saying “This is what I think is wrong, I want to change it.” and now nearly four thousand people have jumped on board and said “Hey, this guys right! That is wrong!” and if you look at the other subreddits like /r/againsthatesubreddits well that’s tens of thousands who agree with the same sentiment. I just figured that if we were gonna all agree something was wrong that we might as well fix it. And now since the Reddit admins have basically all but flat out admitted they aren’t gonna do shit even after everything that’s happened, now we need to start twisting arms. WE the users of reddit need to stand up and say “Hey, shitposting and memes is great and all, but now this is fucked. Now this is dangerous.”
 
>>But I still make mistakes, a lot of them, some of them big. Questions like these can’t be answered easily and you’re bound to make some misjudgments. Just yesterday I announced I had made a mistake. I had erroneously decided at our outset that /r/conservative qualified under our targets of taking down hate speech bastions. I was wrong, it was presumptuous of me and it was based on a limited anecdotal experience that in no way qualified as reasoning to list them. I take full responsibility for it and when I did, I went over to /r/conservative and I reached out to their moderators and users in public and said “I made a mistake, I want to apologize, will you help me start a dialogue to fix this and work together to target what is making reddit worse for wear.”
 
>>You know what I learned? They are scared. Not that they are cowards, no they are scared that we are targeting conservatism itself and that we want to abolish their ideas when nothing could be further from the truth. I think a clashing of ideas is important, but that’s only as long as your ideas aren’t a danger to others. So when I spent the entire day over there discussing and answering questions I received quite a bit of criticism, as did my fellow moderators. But at the same time that I received a lot of criticism, I also received welcoming messages of thanks and respect for my effort to reach out.
 
>>It’s naive to think that we alone on one side can defeat this problem. We need all of reddit to help us, not just the liberal side. So that’s the most difficult part of moderating the sub. Realizing mistakes, adapting and understanding our own ideas on a daily basis and keeping an open mind.
 
 
 
>What do you think of the in line ads disguised somewhat as regular posts?
 
>>Reddit is becoming a business. It’s learning that it can’t satisfy its investors on publicity and gold revenue alone. If they think they can only accomplish that with inline advertisements that truly disrupt my experience, than I’m not sure how they plan to succeed. Reddit is a platform that hosts incredible amounts of knowledge and people of incredible resolve that can be fueled by literally anything. Utilize that. That’s something their competition doesn’t have the ability to effectively utilize.
 
>>But if you’re asking if it has any effect on us? Not negatively no. To be honest, it makes our jobs easier on mobile. Thanks for giving us more material to work with on /r/all. I’ll be happy to show Nike that their new shoes are being promoted on top of a post from T_D talking about their hatred for muslims.

**342,689** Shitty Tipsters giving life advice since **2012**

r/ShittyLifeProTips is a subreddit for the “best” tips out there. The community will brainstorm some of the shittiest ways to get something done and then tell you all about it. These include anything from [storing extra tennis balls in the container,](http://imgur.com/NAmozh5) [breathing underwater,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/6alxzs/lpt_when_underwater_breath_with_a_third_of_your/) and one of the most iconic ones [finding a gas leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/7h2nds/smell_gas_remember_to_us_this_top_tip_from_m/).

Even though this subreddit will never actually help anyone, it has grown into a large community with this being its 3rd feature! The subreddit has continued to grow since its creation in 2012 and has a great moderating team including some big names such as /u/Pravusmentis and /u/Kate_4_President. Both of these people plus 7 more all manage this subreddit and manage to keep the subreddit clean from rule breakers and spammers. 


Some of the other responses I got from Kate were:

>1.With quality shitposts also comes bad ones, is it hard to deal with?

>>**Kate_4_President** We delete [the post] and tell user to heck off. The good thing that comes with moderating a shitty sub, is no one expect[s] anything of you.

>2.What inspired this subreddit?

>>**Kate_4_President** LPT had become such an popular place to shitpost à la askredditt for people looking for easy reposts and karma, shittyLPT was bound to happen as a counter-jerk movement.

>How has the subreddit changed since your last feature?

>>**Kate_4_President** We seem to have grown almost 10x bigger since the last feature! Hopefully we get at least one comment in our feature this time! Also it looks kinda good now, I think. Someone please pat me on the back.

Overall this subreddit has a great community and will give laughs to many people as the subreddit continues to grow even further. I highly recommend subbing to the subreddit and watching it become a subreddit that will eventually reach r/all frequently!

**10,725** armchair academics for **3 years**!

Do you like reading essays? Don’t try and lie to me, I know what you’re thinking. It doesn’t matter if you’ve won the prize for biggest essay lover, or maybe even you’re an English teacher- essays create a certain degree of boredom for __everyone__. When was the last time you read several essays for fun in your free time? Case closed. This is a shame, because there really is a lot of information and knowledge you can gain from absorbing an essay- a lot of which goes to waste because many people never receive the information. 

Videos, on the other hand, are designed to be vibrant and attention-catching. (I’m looking at you, clickbaiters.) And while not all videos are informative, you can get lost in watching them, especially if you start watching something before going to bed because you click play, watch some videos, then some more, then you look up and WTF IT’S 2AM ALREADY?!

With the popularity of videos and the importance of essays, it makes sense someone would want to create a combination to get the best of both worlds. Cue video essays, stage left. 

According to /r/VideoEssay, a video essay is:

> a written essay that is read aloud over video accompaniment which seeks to analyze some media text (tv, film, music, art, speech, etc).

In case that paragraph was too long, too hard, or too essay-ish to read, I’ll summarize for you: *videos* + *essays* = **Video Essays!**

/r/VideoEssay is the subreddit for *all* things video essay. You can write your own essays, watch other people’s essays, or get advice from master essayists. With a plethora of topics from gardening to [gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/videoessay/comments/4ipa1i/are_video_games_ruining_gaming_cod_far_cry/) and [television](https://www.reddit.com/r/videoessay/comments/4ylndm/why_does_film_look_different_to_television/) to taxes, you’ll never react to the word ""essay"" with a frown again. So come on over, grab a cup of tea, and join us in putting the fun back in essay!

Note: intelligence is a desideratum, inferior-IQ plebeians need not read.

Do you find yourself stuck in a cesspool of ignorami? Do you require an outlet to share deep, complex, philosophical musings with homosapiens who can appreciate them? Do you yearn for a discussion where you do not need to translate your eloquent speech into the colloquial tongue through www.thesaurus.com? /r/iamverysmart is perfect for you.


Here a plethora of different types of genii are accepted, whether it be [casual elocutionists of the thesauri](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/6x4ydc/her_best_friend_must_be_a_thesaurus/), [complex and critical thinkers](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/7mc15l/i_can_imagine_complex_stuff_unlike_all_of_you/) at a level incomprehensible to the everyday human (but obviously elementary for the VerySmart^TM ), or intellectuals expressing their [vexation at the idiocy of their associates](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/3ss63v/idiot_tries_to_call_out_other_idiots_gets_called/), as long as you possess an IQ above 135 you can join! The stipulations are that you censor identifying information (after all, /r/iamverysmart is here to mock the primitives of this world not harass them), that you are not impersonating a verysmart but you are genuinely superior (alas, we can't all have high IQs), that you show /r/iamverysmart new intellectuals (after all, we're all aware that Neil Degrasse Tyson's IQ reaches altitudinous levels), and that you refrain from posting rumpus altercations (us verysmarts are here to collaborate, not to have a schism).

As well as the submissions linked above, /r/iamverysmart has acquired a multifarious amount of posts, the crème-de-la-crème including a [noble and considerate intellectual hominid offering to cover a chemistry project for his minuscule-brained partner](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/6ndvpi/my_partner_for_a_chemistry_project_is_a_walking/), a [genius so modest that they would deny themselves the honour of being featured on our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/4s0i6k/my_autistic_cousin_can_make_better_music_than/), an [intelligent being who has struggles we can all relate to](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/7eamyg/i_discriminate_heavily_against_people_with_low_iqs/) and a [groundbreaking discovery that logic is illogical](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/7vfeha/logic_is_illogical/)! There is also a meta~~physics~~ thread, resetting at each crescent moon and full moon, where intellectuals can engage in casual discourse about their daily struggles in this idiot-ridden world or ponder the meaning of life.

So whatever your percentile, GPA or Quantum Physics score, as long as it's exceptional, you're welcome to join /r/iamverysmart and find your intellectual companion!

It comes to that time of year again and you dig through your attic. Aside from the thirteen body bags, seven deteriorated dolls from your niece, a cheaply made humidifier, and what appears to be cocaine, there is nothing. It is a tremendous shame to not have an attic filled with goodies as your neighbor John does. Luckily, you find an ad for a garage sale and quickly make your way over to snatch away all the treasures others have hidden away in their attics.

/r/WTFgarageSale is a subreddit for all the strange, appalling, or quirky things found at a garage sale. Posts are not limited to garage sales. Often you can find bizarre things at a Goodwill or local thrift shop. Most users there have either found or bought the items, but a couple are selling. Why sell? Maybe there's a reason to get rid of it.

*[reptomin](/u/reptomin):* Welcome! We love the absurd smorgasbord of crazy. It can't be replicated in any store. In a normal store (our stuff is CERTAINLY never from there) you'd never find the mix of odd ""art projects"", deodorant or baskets of condoms (we hope not used) deceased family members possessions (and occasionally their remains) or dolls. The damn dolls.

Why are there so many creepy creepy dolls?

Welcome. If you see something weird at a garage sale, Thrift store, or Goodwill.. We want to see it.

**Below are some comments from the moderators:**

>#1. What is your favorite aspect of the community?

>>**[reptomin](/u/reptomin):** The sense of hunting and achievement people have when they post their most WTF thing possible.

>#2. What has your experience moderating /r/WTFgarageSale been like during your time here?

>>**[reptomin](/u/reptomin):** Very positive. Everyone seems to be so supportive and all in on the same joke.

>#3. Do you have a favorite submission?

>>**[reptomin](/u/reptomin):** Heh. Oh my.. Let's see.. The mouth mug? Jesus Look At The Time was funny..

>#4. If you could buy anything that has been posted to /r/WTFgarageSale, what would it be?

>>**[reptomin](/u/reptomin):** I... Don't think I want any of it. Some I'd buy to burn for the good of humanity.

>#5. Is there anything you would like to say to the community? 

>>**[reptomin](/u/reptomin):** This has grown beyond my wildest dreams. Thanks, keep on the hunt and tell your friends to send you pics of their weird finds. Let people that work in thrift stores know you want to see the weird things people donate. And have fun in the hunt for the weird!

So many things can be unexpected. You click on a video of any average Joe discarding of his cigarette butt, and a few seconds later, the entire street is in ruins. You click on another video that advertises a string breaking, but it's the only string you wouldn't expect. You expect to click on an essay and OH MY GOD WHY IS EVERYTHING WINGDINGS NOW?!?!

*breathe, and count*

Many things in life will catch you by surprise. r/Unexpected has no shortage of surprises. Some require you to think about them, others are more in-your-face. It is the sub that constantly reminds you to think outside the box always. It is the sub where people can so stuff accidentally that no one would have thought would be possible. And it can happen at anytime, [whether you are on your way to work](https://i.imgur.com/nlkCGVY.gifv) or [during a completely normal photo shoot](https://streamable.com/opfin) or maybe even during an [event you never want to be a part of](https://i.imgur.com/00zsTRm.gifv). What happened? Was it bad luck? Dumbassery? A series of unfortunate and unexpected events? Whatever caused the events, over a million people are guaranteed to be shocked by every one of these. The result? A subreddit that never fails to surprise me. Always expect the unexpected. Or unexpect the expected. Or bleh. Enjoy!

As of yesterday, the reddit redesign is now open to all users who are signed up for reddit beta. The mission of /r/RedesignHelp is to help moderators get their subs ready for the launch of the redesign. 

On the subreddit, you can ask questions to help optimize your design. You'll find helpful links, like /u/calexil's [redesign status wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesignstatus/wiki/index), which tracks the status of bug reports and enhancement requests. You'll also find tutorials and resources. 

If you're a mod and haven't started on your subreddit's redesign, now is the time!

Finally, /r/RedesignHelp is sanctioned by the admins, but it's run by moderators who have been working in the alpha and want to help their fellow mods.

**44,809** Eagle-eyed Players for **8 months!**



&nbsp;




It's the little details that often differentiate a good game from a masterpiece. While the large parts making up the game are certainty important, it's those small details and Easter eggs that make the immersion so much more real, and that make the player feel really happy whenever they find them. Things like [seemingly unimportant events being referenced in later games in the franchise] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7livi2/at_the_beginning_of_the_first_half_life_you_can/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GamingDetails), [little realistic effects in weapons that you wouldn't expect to see] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7k7j5c/if_you_partially_pull_the_trigger_on_a_controller/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GamingDetails), and even [hidden messages within the OSTs frequency spectrum] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/6khryc/in_doom_2016_a_spectrograph_of_the_soundtrack/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=GamingDetails). There are so many small details and hidden Easter eggs in video games, that serve as little rewards for the dedicated players who take the time to look around past the main game.

> **1: How and why did you get involved in the subreddit?**

>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Following on from the success of /r/moviedetails kind of exploding within a few days we thought it'd be a cool idea to branch out and make some similar subreddits for other media, seeing as we were getting a lot of TV / gaming related posts on moviedetails as it was. Aside from a couple of mods who just moderate one of the three subreddits (TVDetails, GamingDetails, and MovieDetails) we all mod all three so we try to keep them pretty tightly knit.


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Honestly not too bad. Keep out reposts, spoilers, and spam (amateur app devs seem to love trying to promote their asset flip games on every subreddit with ""gaming"" in the name) and ensure all posts fit within general rules. Comment civility is another area that takes a priority but generally they're all good.

> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** I saw https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/81rf3r/in_far_cry_3_you_can_find_the_buried_head_in_the/ on my frontpage a couple of days back and it occurred to me that despite seeing the game so often I'd never even noticed the skull...

> **4: What are some of your favourite small details in video games?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Generally I love stuff where game designers put in subtle references to their past - https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7zlunl/in_super_mario_odysseys_balloon_world_update/ as an example.

> **5: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Short term hopefully watch it grow more and see more great submissions come in! Long term no idea, ideas are welcome!

> **6: Anything else you want to add?**


>> **MuchRedditLessTime** Not really, no.


You have to marvel at the tiny things that designers will slip in their work, and likewise, the players who discover them. I often fail to notice ""hidden"" switches needed to progress in dungeons, and spend 20 minutes looking for it before realising that it was in plain fucking sight the whole time. But here you have people managing to locate [tiny reflections in 2002 games] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7iwzat/in_spiderman_2002_in_the_mission_breaking_and/), and [toilet seats changing orientation depending on what gender your character is] (https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/7onllv/in_prey_2017_depending_on_what_gender_you_choose/). I'm sure most of you are gamers to some extent. I'd recommend you all to check out this sub if you are, because you might just find hidden details about your favourite games. I, personally, have found many details about my favourite games that I never even noticed playing through them my first, second, eighth time. Maybe I'm just blind, though.

**166,239** currently farming for **5 years!**

Many games that come out today always seem to be combat oriented. In the top 40 games played on steam (at this moment) there are only three(!) that aren't combat focused games. Even then two of the three are competition based. The one game that doesn't fit quite into the combat/competition style is Stardew Valley.

Stardew Valley is a popular game released on PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Switch. It is an open-ended farming RPG. You can take the game at your own pace, whatever that may be. If you want to have a playstyle that is just to cool your engine before bed, or if you want to be more adventurous, this game has it covered.

Another amazing part of the game is the community. Compared to other gaming communities, the community surrounding Stardew Valley is one of the most supportive and kind communities. The reason for this is because of the non competitive nature of the game. That being said, along with the supportiveness of the the community, there is a good amount of joking about things like in game characters, and weird requests.
 

#####Some of the many activities in this game you can do are:

Turn an overgrown field that you inherited into a farm.

Socialize in the town, where there is a good amount of people all with their own schedules to bond with, and possibly even marry.

Explore a vast cave system, where you can get resources for your farm, and improve skills.

Fishing is another relaxing way to spend days in game. There is many types of fish in different parts of the world, and at different times of the in game year.

And of course, much more!

*****
Here we have an interview from the mods of /r/StardewValley

>##When and how were you introduced to the game/sub?

>>**/u/pathoschild** I bought the game because it looked so relaxing. I loved the idea of unwinding after a hard day IRL by watering crops, learning about the villagers, exploring the mines, and fishing as the sun sets over the ocean. From there I accidentally got into modding (I just wanted to fix a bug and ended up as the lead SMAPI developer), and then it was a short hop to moderating the Discord and Subreddit.

>##What's your favorite aspect of the game?

>>**/u/pathoschild** I love how relaxing it is, and how much mods can do. They're much more powerful than mods in most other games.

>##What's moderating the sub like?

>>**/u/pathoschild** The subreddit is an amazingly friendly and welcoming community, where players can leave their problems at the door for a bit and discuss their shared hobby. We do need to watch it closely though, to handle any arguments, personal attacks, and trolling before they get out of hand. The community is pretty good about reporting problem users or comments, which is a great help.

>##What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>>**/u/pathoschild** I love seeing the fan art and cosplays, the posts from players who were helped or inspired by the game, and how promptly players who need help find it there. Also the FAQs post, because it's tamped down on new players asking the same questions.

>##Any tips for new players?

>>**/u/pathoschild** Check out the pinned FAQs and beginner questions post, it has lots of info for new players.

>##Anything else you want to add?

>>**/u/pathoschild** If you're looking for a relaxing game with a friendly community, you're welcome in /r/StardewValley. :)

Stardew Valley is currently $15 on all platforms. It's about to release an update that includes co-op multiplayer into the game

**15,225,000** scientists *questioning* for **9 Years**

&nbsp; 

Today, arguably one of the greatest scientists of our lifetime passed away - Stephen Hawking, aged 76 died of natural causes in his sleep. He was an inspiration to many, winning several awards and being one of the most well known figures in science. He had motor neurone disease and was subject to die aged 24, however he persevered and managed to prolong his life substantially. Some of his greatest discoveries include Hawking Radiation  (how black holes radiate) and Hawking Energy. R.I.P Stephen Hawking. To commemorate this man, we thought it was only appropriate to feature a science-related subreddit - and what sub is better than /r/AskScience? It's often overlooked, as people tend to veer away from the academic side of the internet, as they would (most typically) rather spend time looking at memes or cat gifs, however, if you do find yourself over on /r/AskScience you can find out some quite interesting stuff. Ever wondered [what percent of your weight you lift whilst doing a push up?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/78xinz/what_of_my_weight_am_i_actually_lifting_when/) [Or why your computer needs to restart to perform updates?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7mmz8i/why_do_computers_and_game_consoles_need_to/) - /r/AskScience is the perfect place for all your curiosities and questions surrounding science, whether it be ideas in your head or about the world around you.

The moderation team of r/AskScience in short is fantastic. Many people regard the mod-team to be the best modteam that exists on reddit; here is a small interview with a portion of that amazing team!

>##1. What do you like about the sub? 
>>**MockDeath (mod)** I love the amount of things I have learned from the sub and interactions with our experts.

>##2. What is your personal experience with science and what drew you towards r/AskScience?
>>**MockDeath** I have always been a proponent of science education and teaching people about it. I do not work in a field of science directly. A long time ago /r/science banned text submissions, so myself and /u/TheWalruss got to chatting and we got invited as mods to /r/AskScience (which was a dead sub at the time with 300 subscribers). We wanted a place where people could ask scientists direct questions.

>##3. What plans do you have for the community in the future?
>>**MockDeath** I have always struggled on how to shape AskScience in the future and I have no good answer for what I plan to do with it in the future.

>##4. What is it like moderating r/AskScience?
>>**MockDeath** It can be a mix between some of the most terribly boring tasks removing off topic comments and pulling posts out of the spam filter, to being a rush of satisfaction as you help people get answers to their questions. While it has its moments of boring tasks, it is one of the most satisfying things I do.

Life ain't fair.

That's what /r/IRLSmurfing is all about - naive people getting their asses whooped by professionals who don't even break a sweat. Yeah, that's right - I used a big word. It's the only word that can describe some of the content; it's just unreal.

>##1. What is your favourite post? 
>>**conalfisher (mod)**  I really like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/irlsmurfing/comments/5qg0xd/cruise_ship_break_dance_crew_accidentally_picks/) post, because absolutely nobody expected it. With a lot of these smurfing videos, they're made with a big production crew, multiple camera shots, some really famous guy in that specific field, and you can never really tell which are real and which ones are complete bullshit with actors. Not this one though. It's just an innocent, homemade video with some good, old fashioned smurfing.

>##2. What do you like about moderating the sub?

>>**conalfisher**  With a lot of subs, you end up not really caring about most of the posts you sift through, and in some ways it can take the fun out of the sub, it becomes more of a responsibility. You can't just casually browse through it, because 2 posts in you see that there's an incorrect post, or a report or something. Not this sub though, with this sub every post (that we let through) is quality, and I genuinely enjoy browsing the sub. Plus, the sub has a low enough activity that there isn't even that much to look through.

>##3. Where do you see the sub in a year?

>>**conalfisher** I see it more or less being where it is right now. There's not really much else to do with the sub, other than to continue growing it. There aren't any real problems on the sub. All we can really do at this point is try and make the posts more frequent and of better quality.

>##4. What do you have planned for the community?

>>**conalfisher** Maybe we could finally get CSS once the redesign is forced down our throats. That would be something.

**7,068** Edgelords for **1 year**!


&nbsp;



/r/imgoingtohellforthis. /r/DankMemes. /r/Me_IRL. What do these subs all have in common?



Correct. They're all filled with 12 year olds who think that making jokes about suicide and school shootings is *absolutely hilarious*.

Well they're not. I like a bit of dark humour. And sometimes it's the darkest jokes that are the funniest. But the problem is, your dark joke still has to be **a joke**. When you get to the point that all you're doing is dropping in as many offensive words and phrases as possible, it stops being funny, and just becomes ~~borderline~~ cringy. 


That is the thought process that lead to /r/ImVeryEdgy. I'm sure you've heard of subs like r/IAmVeryBadass and /r/IAmVerySmart, and /r/ImVeryEdgy was made with the same idea in mind; to highlight examples of people/memes being edgy to the point of it just being sad, sad that someone even thought their post [combining suicide, autism and shitty reaction images] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/70nxda/even_rdankmemes_thought_this_was_iffy/) was anything but cringy. I'd recommend wearing multiple layers of unwanted clothing before going into this sub, because by the time you get out they'll all be shredded apart by the pure unfiltered edge. You have your [racist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/6swyrb/badabumtsst/) [""memes""] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/70knu1/hahahahhahahahahaha_get_it/), [completely unaware radical anti-SJWs] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/61styi/wow_just_wow/), [kidnapping children] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/7blzw1/hahaha_because_kidnapping/), [destroying libtards] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/799s1y/libtards_roasted/), [many] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/6rnzib/they_actually_believe_that_people_get_offended_by/), [*many*] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/71hjlg/if_you_want_to_know_what_to_post_on_this_sub_this/) [suicide] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/7tm7ml/suicide/) [""jokes""] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/7l6deh/hahahaha_because_suicide_is_funny_amirite/), and so many school shooting posts that I'm not even going to try and get through them ([here's] (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/71aday/i_have_no_words/) a personal ""favourite"" though).



The sub, as you could probably tell already, is making a mockery of all the edgy shit you find in the dank memes community. If you hate all the shitty attempts at humour that those communities shit out, the this is the sub for you. The community here understands that these posts are terrible, and ridicules them.




What you have to understand, however, is that you can have a joke about suicide, or a school shooting, and have it be funny, if you can pull it off well. Of course, it'll still rely somewhat on the shock value to have any sort of comedic value, but it could still be considered a ""joke"" to some extent. But the posts on /r/ImVeryEdgy are the [worst of the worst.]
 (https://www.reddit.com/r/imveryedgy/comments/7ok37r/the_final_boss_of_this_sub/) These are the posts that even /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, the sub with more edgelords than the rest of the site, find a little cringy. And when *those guys* think a meme is being too edgy, you know it must be really fucking bad.

**100,801** readers tackling for **1 year!**



Watching animals is cute. Watching people get non seriously injured can be funny. Why not combine both of those into a single thing? That’s exactly what dogberg is, dogs doing wrestling moves on people, animals, and objects.

Dogberg consists of many tackles, many highspeed leg sweeps, many oblivious kids, and of course, dogs.

It’s easier to show why this subreddit is loved. When dogs do [Flying Elbow Drops](https://i.imgur.com/gCDbqfN.gifv), or they [Get annoyed at that *one* trombone player](https://i.imgur.com/QRw9UMn.gifv). There is also a nice amount of [Dog miscalculations](https://i.imgur.com/ET5ypg8.gifv).

##Below is an interview from the a couple of the moderators of /r/Dogberg 
>##1. Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>>**/u/maybesaydie** If you enjoy dogs and wrestling this is the place to be. I've been here for a couple months

>>**/u/Merari01** I joined the subreddit 2 months ago.

>##2. What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

>>**/u/maybesaydie** [This submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogberg/comments/7wrt09/comin_at_ya/) cracks me up every time I watch it. 

>>**/u/Merari01** https://i.imgur.com/HuXWp0t.gifv

>##3. Do you have any plans for the sub in the future?

>>**/u/maybesaydie** We plan to keep doing things just as we have. It's a friendly community full of exuberant dogs. What could be better?

>>**/u/Merari01** Never change a good thing.

>##4. Anything else you wanted to add?

>>**/u/TonyQuark** The name Dogberg stems from 'dog' + 'Goldberg' (the wrestler).

If you are laughing as hard as I was when I saw the videos for the first time, then you should drop by the subreddit!

**7,593** viewers with the captions on for **3 years!**

/r/SadlyGoKarts is a subreddit for only the best TV subtitles out there. The namesake is from [this] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LHpeFfBRF8U) part of a Breaking Bad episode, in which Pinkman, as the name suggests, sadly go-karts. It even [said that, too, in the captions] (https://redd.it/5z5d4w).




The job of a subtitle writer is a boring one. You listen to the audio that you're subtitling, and you transcribe it word for word, making sure the subtitles pop up at the correct times to make them be in sync with the words being spoken. Oftentimes these subtitle writers, feeling bored, will slip in little jokes and Easter eggs that you might not notice while watching. Maybe it's as simple as [detailing *exactly* what is going on in the scene] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/5z5rus/sad/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=sadlygokarts), maybe it's a [joke about the character's personality] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/5z5x5a/laughs/), or maybe it's just a [straight up meme] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/5z5er4/vulcan_tears/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=sadlygokarts). Either way, it's always a funny thing to see when you're just watching a TV show, and it can often add to the humour itself ~~and it's also a clear indication that subs are better than dubs~~.



The sub is filled with great examples of subtitles that really add to the show, and make you laugh. You have [prequel memes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/6j95pd/the_force_is_strong_in_this_one/), [mildly racist subtitles] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/5z60j9/laughs/), [10/10 translating] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/64z06q/te_mata_en_espa%C3%B1ol/), [4th wall breaks from editors who are clearly not being paid enough for this shit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sadlygokarts/comments/7tady4/when_they_dont_pay_you_enough_for_the_work_you_do/), and much more. I highly recommend everyone to check this sub out, because every post is a gem and the community is wonderful

The pilot quickly gained a large fanbase after first viewing and have made all things from fanart to fanfiction, all from an 8-minute video.

The subreddit has been the amalgamation of the fanbase, the place where the fanbase converges to discuss new art, discussions, fanfiction, and even an [AMA with the creator of the show.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityTrain/comments/5em4s1/im_owen_dennis_i_created_infinity_train_ama/) Because of all this, the subreddit has grown to more than 3,000 subscribers, and has just kept growing steadily.

This all came to an end, however, when Cartoon Network, after 1 year, 4 months, 1 day, and 21 hours, published an [official teaser for the show.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwiW-rd2UNk) After many months of dropping hints, the uncertainty about the show's future has officially stopped dead in its tracks. Now that the train has departed, the anxious wait for the first episode has begun.

**58,183** people not failing at simple tasks for **5 years!**



&nbsp;




There are many things in life that could be classified as ""difficult"". Performing brain surgery, flying a plane, getting a Dam Agent 0:52, trying to sneak downstairs for food at 2am while trying to be quiet and oh Jesus Christ dog, shut up you're going to get me spotted ah FOR FUCKS SAKE I KNOCKED OVER A POT WHAT THE SHI- 


*Ahem.*



As I was saying, many things in the world are hard to do. Many jobs are difficult and stressful. Some jobs are painful physically and mentally. And others are just plain easy in comparison. But it's those easy jobs that many people seem to fuck up, and that's what /r/OneJob is for. It is a sub highlighting occurrences where someone completely fucked up the simplest of tasks. It ranges from the [small and less significant] (https://www.reddit.com/r/onejob/comments/5kttaw/qo%C9%BE_%C7%9Duo_p%C9%90%C9%A5_no/) to the [massive and holy fuck how did you get qualified to do that?] (https://www.reddit.com/r/onejob/comments/6fe4rm/presidents_spokesman_has_one_job/) Some things just aren't that complicated to do, but people still manage to mess them up. It's impressive, really, how badly people can fail at their job, like with [this excellent maze] (https://www.reddit.com/r/onejob/comments/763kiu/perhaps_you_can_help_rocco_get_home/). It makes you wonder if these people know, or were even aware they screwed up that badly. Was it just a brain fart in the morning? Was it an intentional fuck-you because they hated their job? Was it just plain ol' incompetence? We may never know, and that's the fun part about it. All we have is the aftermath of the incident, and we get to fill in the blanks. It makes you wonder though; these people may not have ever known of their monumental mess-up, nor their temporary fame on the internet. So I ask the question; how do you know YOU'VE never fucked up this badly?

**73,716** Heroes *saving lives* for **3** years!

*Boku No Hero Academia (*My Hero Academia*) is a manga series written and illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi since 2015. It follows the story of Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without superpowers in a world where they are the norm, but who still dreams of becoming a superhero himself, and is scouted by the world's greatest hero who shares his powers with Izuku after recognising his value and enrols him in a high school for heroes in training.

/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia has been the central discussion hub for the series on Reddit since it began back in 2015, and its reputation precedes it. At a glance, anybody can see the effort put into fanart, predictions, match ups and idle thoughts. This is a community where *everyone* wants to make it the best possible experience for everybody else.

**Below are some comments from the Moderators of /r/Fantasy:**

> **Why did you become a Moderator of /r/BokuNoHeroAcademia ?**
>>**u/jhoudiey:**
> Cause I love the hell outta BnHA, and I heard that they were looking for another mod. I decided to harass Stalin about it.

>> **u/Leinbow:**
> Because I love HeroAca and I'm an active regular in the subreddit so I applied to have a lil bit more contribution to the fandom.

> **Who is your favourite character, and, what is your favourite fight?**
>>**u/jhoudiey:**
> BAKUGOU MOTHERFUCKING KATSUKI. Favourite fight is uhhh... mega spoilers: [The entire Bakugou Rescue arc, especially Bakugou telling Shiggy to essentially fuck himself. MAN, so good...](/Spoiler)

>> **u/Leinbow:**
> Deku is my fave, and my fave fight so far in the series is the [Deku VS Kacchan 2.](/Spoilers)

> **Do you have any hopes for the community going forward?**
>>**u/jhoudiey:**
> Hoping to crush past the 100K mark after S3 starts, and hoping for more discussion :>

>> **u/Leinbow:**
> I hope the fandom will grow bigger but at the same time maintain the level of civility we have now. It's no surprise that the bigger a fandom gets, the shittier it gets, but I believe HeroAca has the power to break that stereotype! Hopefully!!

> **Do you have any favourite submissions?**
>>**u/jhoudiey:**
> Hmmm, I honestly can't think of any off the top of my head, but there has been some damn good fanart posted.

>> **u/Leinbow:**
> I love discussion posts especially when they have something new to offer to the table, like the [**""imitation"" theory for Ochako**](https://redd.it/5n21a9) and recently, the **[impact of social media in the series' universe](https://redd.it/7y6sya)** posts, to name a couple.



> **Anything else to add?**
>>**u/jhoudiey:**
> Bakugou is best girl.

>> **u/Leinbow:**
> Shipping is for fun, don't take it too seriously. Say no to ship wars!

**Here are some featured threads taken from /r/BokuNoHeroAcademia chosen by the Writer:**

- **[Finally did a drawing of ALL MIGHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/7pnpoe/finally_did_a_drawing_of_all_might/)**

**38,542** followers for **5 Years!**


&nbsp;


Surprising news today when moderators discovered that /u/SROTDroid had been banned. The individual responsible for this act still remains unknown to the public. We have confirmed, however, that the moderator has resigned from their position. If you think this was bizarre, you will find the reasoning even more bizarre. 

The unknown moderator was quoted saying ""/u/SROTDroid is clearly a spambot. Seriously. Look at the sub! Every single post is by that bot!"" 

We attempted to further question them, but all the former moderator told us was ""If others don't get to post flood on Reddit, then there is no reason for /u/SROTDroid to be able to"".

Even more bizarre was when the subreddit received a call from the former moderator's lawyer, claiming tort. That lawyer is now refusing to comment after being reminded that the user resigned themselves.

Although /r/SubredditOfTheDay is not open to the press on this matter, one of the moderators has commented on this tragic incident. When asked what they had to say, writer [_tomGER](/u/_tomGER) quietly yelled in a poorly self contained fit, ""If karma doesn’t hit you, I gladly will!"" 

&nbsp;

/r/NewsOfTheStupid is a subreddit about all the ironic, stupid things that have hit the headlines. There are those who think it is smart to support abstinence, but end up getting pregnant, to people admitting to burglary and murder on their social media. Most of the articles will make you wonder what the heck were these people thinking? A common trend appears to be activists being complete hypocrites. Vegans claiming to have cured cancer, but are fined for lying. Anti-vax supporter getting her kids vaccinated after they all get sick. A politician commercially selling a book during the holidays about how commercializing holidays are bad. The other common trend appears to be people incriminating themselves. An officer who filmed himself planting evidence. A man posting on Facebook the goods he has just stolen from a house. Someone taunting the police to arrest them on social media, but only to be arrested a few minutes later. 

Most of the time, we never think we would do anything as stupid as some of those people, but watch out. One day, you might just make the hot page. For the time being, come chuckle at others on /r/NewsOfTheStupid.

**Below are some comments from the moderators:**

>#1. What is your favorite aspect of the community?

>>**[ElderCunningham](/u/ElderCunningham):** My favorite aspect of the community is how friendly things seem. Even when a user submits a post that someone else might disagree with the stupidity of, they just downvote it instead of saying ""STFU, that's not stupid! Blargh!""


>#2. What has your experience moderating /r/NewsOfTheStupid been like during your time here?

>>**[ElderCunningham](/u/ElderCunningham):** It's tough to come up with an exact favorite experience. But I did love when earlier on, /u/nickster79 came aboard and really helped me to grow it. It was fun working with him to get more users and develop things a little bit more. We even had an ordeal with another sub when we get submitting posts with ""xposted from /r/NewsOfTheStupid"" leading to both of us getting a temp ban. Now they even have a ""no x-posting"" rule thanks to us.
>>
>>We've formed a ""lose acquaintance"" sort of friendship since.

>#3. Do you have a favorite submission?

>>**[ElderCunningham](/u/ElderCunningham):** It's tough to pick just one, but I do seem to prefer submissions about average Joe's doing dumb things rather than a politician doing something dumb, as that seems to happen so much
>>
>>One that does stand out, however, was the post about a student who doesn't show up to school due to a doctor's appointment. The receptionist calls his cell phone, thinks she hears a bomb threat. School is locked down and the kid is arrested. Turns out she only heard the theme song from The Fresh Prince Of BelAir.

>#4. If there was a NewsOfTheStupid article written about you, what would you want the headline to be?

>>**[ElderCunningham](/u/ElderCunningham):** Probably about a guy who stabbed me because I wouldn't stop making puns.

>#5. Is there anything you would like to say to the community?

>>**[ElderCunningham](/u/ElderCunningham):** Thank you to all who are active in the sub. And play your cards right, unless you want to see a post about yourself show up here.

The Legend Of Zelda. You've all heard of it, and I'm sure most of you have played it. It is commonly referred to as one of the best video game series of all time, and I'm inclined to agree. Even if there are a few games that not everybody really liked, they still weren't *bad*. The Zelda series has managed to be consistently high quality, fun, and downright amazing all throughout its now 32 year lifespan. Think about that. Imagine keeping a series at high quality for that long. Many TV shows can barely go 2 seasons without fucking up and getting boring. So the amount of work and effort that must have went into the series is mind boggling. The Legend Of Zelda, without a doubt, changed gaming for good. It basically created the adventure RPG video game format. There were attempts before, yes, but none as successful as The Legend Of Zelda.





A brief history of the series; The first Zelda game came out this day, 32 years ago, in the 21st February 1986, on the new console of the time, the Nintendo Entertainment System. It came out just after the release of Super Mario Bros, which I guarantee everybody here has played. While Mario was more based around platforming and used a sidescrolling format in timed levels, Zelda took an almost complete opposite approach, with a vast overworld, no specific path for you to take, and as much time to do stuff as you wanted (and you'd need all that time, because the game was completely filled to the brim with secrets and treasure). The game was a massive success, to say the least. It sold over 6.5 million copies worldwide, and got excellent reviews all round the board (granted, there weren't too many people rating games at the time, but I digress). The game inspired a massive line of high quality adventure games, the most recent being [The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild], which, in typical Zelda fashion, has been widely considered one of the best games in years, with excellent reviews. 


Personally, I love the Zelda franchise. It's one of, if not my favourite game series of all time. And many other people share that same opinion too, as shown in today's Subreddit Of The Day: /r/Zelda. This is a subreddit for all things Zelda. Whether it's fishing about how much you love the game, memes, fanart, anything Zelda can go here.





> **1:  Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** I joined a long, long time ago. It was just one other mod and I wanted to help spruce it up.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** I joined the subreddit as a user a few years ago, it was one of the first communities I subscribed to on reddit being a long-time fan of the series. I became a mod just over a year ago in the build up to the release of Breath of the Wild, the latest game in the series.

>> **/u/justcallmezach** Before the Skyward Sword launch, there was an open call for moderator applications. Having always been a Zelda fan, I thought it was a perfect time to apply for the mod team, and they decided to take me on!


> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** It's relatively good. We try to not interfere too much, but also have a few rules to try and keep down on what some might call ""low content"" posts. As the years go by, users preferences change and we try to stay with that.


>> **/u/BaconLondoner** It's a great experience on the most part, I just like being a part of the community, it's great to help out with something you're a big fan of

>> **/u/justcallmezach** What's moderating the sub like? I'm not nearly as active as some of our dedicated moderators, but I do enjoy some of the mod mail we get. I have yet to find a user banned for inappropriate behavior that wasn't completely convinced they did nothing wrong. Just be nice, everybody! Is only game. Why you hef to be mad?


> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** I love posts that users have created things. Here's just a few. [1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/7913es/my_guruguru_cosplay_from_the_legend_of_zelda/) [2 ] (https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/76ssy5/was_feeling_festive_so_i_sculpted_a_poe/) [3] (https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/74o1kp/botw_i_3d_printed_the_guardian_sword_for_wizardcon/). They really help between games. Also, cool, new neat tricks in games are always fun.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** I have to agree with WoozleWuzzle here, fan creations are what keeps our community alive, from fan drawings and art to full blown cosplay and sculptures, Zelda fans are so passionate and put a lot of effort into what they do.

>> **/u/justcallmezach** I love the lore posts. The fanart and creations are always neat, but I love seeing some of the theories people come up with. I also have a guilty pleasure for shitposts, but don't tell the other mods.

> **4: When did you first get interested in the Zelda franchise?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** I'm ""old."" I played the original NES game when I was 5 years old. I remember the dungeon music scaring me as a kid if I was left alone playing.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** Honestly, I've loved Zelda for as long as I can remember. All of my childhood drawings are littered with triforces and green caps. It's pretty much always been a big part of my life.

>> **/u/justcallmezach** I grew up on a farm in the great plains, the youngest of 3 siblings by a wide margin. My family ran a small farm. In the winter when the crops aren't growing, after feeding the cows in the morning, my dad didn't have much to do until... It was time to feed the cows at night. Even though I was only 3 when the original Legend of Zelda came out, I still have memories of my dad and my older sisters playing to pass the time during the day. When they were at school, I'd hang with dad and we'd go exploring. I still remember having the original map laminated and marking the bomb/fire locations with a dot with a sharpie.

>> As I grew older, I remember moving onto Adventures of Link. While my older sisters did the bulk of navigating the game, I distinctly remember the night my dad was the one to beat the Thunderbird and then Dark Link. It was amazing.

> **5: What do you think makes Zelda games consistently good (ignoring *those* games. You know which ones I'm talking about.)**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** I think people like solving puzzles and the sense of accomplishment when they figure it out. At least that's one thing I enjoyed when I was young and has stuck with me. The combat is definitely fun too. I think it's the balance between the two.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** Zelda has something for everyone, it's not just targeted to one style of play. If you want a fighting game, you can go around and kill all the monsters you can. If you want a puzzle game, go find a dungeon! That combined with a consistently interesting story, entertaining cast of characters and overall fun gameplay mechanics make for a great game series.

>> **/u/justcallmezach** Zelda has landed in the cultural zeitgeist through mesmerizing gameplay and extraordinary storytelling. Link and the Triforce has become as much of a part of cultural legend as Cinderella and the glass slipper, or Honest Abe and the cherry tree. While everyone has games that they love and hate alike, I think we can all agree that there is a level of quality throughout all the games that makes it such a respected IP.



> **6: Which Zelda game would you say is your favourite?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** BoTW has most likely become my favorite. Others in the running are the original NES, Link's Awakening, Wind Waker and of course OoT.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** It's impossible to choose! Overall, I'd have to say Breath of the Wild but I love every Zelda game for a different reason. Wind Waker's gameplay, Skyward Sword's story, Twilight Princess' music and atmosphere. Then there's the classics, Link's Awakening, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, all of them hold a special place in my heart and naming just 1 as my favourite feels like I'm doing a disservice to the rest.

>> **/u/justcallmezach** Like so many, I have a special place in my heart for Ocarina. I was 13 when it came out, and spent every waking moment exploring the ins and outs. I was my friends' own personal hotline for game tips, as the internet was in the early stages and littered with rumors like finding the triforce and unlocking Luigi in Mario 64, instead of actual sound information like how to complete the Biggoron's sword quest line. My phone rang off the hook every night for a solid 6 months from friends looking for advice.

>> That said, the original Legend of Zelda gets a runthrough at least once a year. I'm not a serious speed runner, but I do have a good time seeing how fast I can play through the game. It's amazing to think that a game that once took almost a year for my family to conquer can now be completed by a (not by any means great) speedrunner in several hours.



> **7: What's the Zelda community like in your opinion?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** It's mostly good. Most people are positive. There's the hardcore fanbase that get into the lore. Any time you get hardcore it can cause some spats. But overall people just want to share their love of the games.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** The Zelda community, while it has it's faults is an overall positive, welcoming group that I'm proud to be a part of. I'm not saying it's perfect but everything has flaws and I wouldn't trade it for any other community.


>> **/u/justcallmezach** As an 'older' redditor, it's always interesting to see what the perspective of the younger crowd is. So many kids are playing Breath of the Wild as their first experience. They're so lucky to have a game like that to dive into. It really is the modern equivalent of the original Legend of Zelda with its ""Go ahead. Do whatever you want to."" approach.

> **8: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** Nothing really. The community shapes us, we try not to shape the community. We have a few set rules to abide by, but the internet is always changing and growing.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** Honestly, we're at a pretty good stage with the sub right now. The team is happy with the current design, we've fairly recently had a complete rule reform voted for by the users, there's not much we have to change. We don't want to impact on the community's experience too much, it's not just our subreddit, it's everyone's so if the users want something changed down the line, we'll work on that.

>> **/u/justcallmezach** I'm just along for the ride, always happy to follow along with what our top mods think is best.

> **9: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/WoozleWuzzle** I'm left handed. Link was once left handed. I thought that was really neat.

>> **/u/BaconLondoner** I could write something nice and heartwarming here but instead, [here's] (https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AMaiGKIiK8k/V0CN6x5kVmI/AAAAAAAAEfI/eLAhPVxP10gg1rtkZomg2VJE6thFO0-yACLcB/s640/Ch3Zn0KXAAAUQoO.png) a picture of a dog I found online!

>> **/u/justcallmezach** I don't know what the next game in the Zelda series will bring, but the bar was set insanely high with BotW. As a lifelong Nintendo fan, I can't wait to see what they come up with next.

There is a saying that if *it* exists there is porn of it, that is called Rule 34. Similarly on reddit, if there is an idea. There is a subreddit for it, for example, /r/Rule34 is for all things rule 34 related. Of course that link goes to a NSFW subreddit, so I'd advise against going there during work hours. Furthermore, Rule 35 was created when porn of something that exists... didn't exist, so someone would have to make porn of that particular thing. Basically, rule 35 compliments rule 34. It helps close that loophole.

Back before the creation of the HTML5 standard, a company by the name of Gfycat sprout up to support a new standard for gifs. Basically they used webm [magic](https://gfycat.com/EminentPoshHydra) to make HD videos smaller than gifs. I'm not joking, that is literally it. To stand out, their links had a weird [naming conventions.](https://medium.com/@Gfycat/naming-conventions-97960fc40179) People still go back to this /r/NoStupidQuestions post to [understand them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3ffoe1/why_are_gfycat_file_names_so_weird/cto6b1e/) But even though they were one of a kind and stood out like a [peacock during his mating ritual](https://gfycat.com/PreciousGraciousChick)... it was an up hill struggle.

At the time it was a technical marvel. People where just used to downloading gifs that were as fat as their grandmas. Some folks I do not wish to name were [die hard](https://gfycat.com/UnderstatedFortunateAquaticleech) non-believers of such [wizardry.](https://gfycat.com/DirtyRespectfulHoneyeater) Who can blame them? Some people just get used to the shit existence they get [trapped in.](https://gfycat.com/RequiredGoodnaturedBasil) There are some [prisoners](https://gfycat.com/ScaryKnobbyBandicoot) who prefer jail then [freedom.](https://gfycat.com/OptimisticPoisedApe)

Not to [toot](https://gfycat.com/SickCharmingGarpike) my own [horn](https://gfycat.com/DampRingedElver) but I one of the first to join the bandwagon. And I saw a chance to vastly improve the internet experience for ALL internet users. By simply switching over to gfycats from gifs we would be saving massive amounts of bandwidth. This would be a god send for [mobile](https://gfycat.com/BitesizedGiganticCheetah) users, [laptop](https://gfycat.com/ParallelBlissfulArchaeocete) users, and our bandwidth resource starved brothers [around the world](https://gfycat.com/OrneryYellowIndochinesetiger)... surprising this includes [Australia](https://gfycat.com/AltruisticLeadingHornshark) and [Canada.](https://gfycat.com/LiquidAjarAss)

Originally, I planned on simply promoting gfycats the same way /r/gifs promotes gifs... [garbage](https://gfycat.com/GrandIncredibleAstarte) landfill style. Then I said, ""I can do [better](https://gfycat.com/DelightfulCourteousAsianpiedstarling) than that! Let me do something way more [fancy](https://gfycat.com/HollowHotBlowfish)!"" What if I showcased gfycats AND made it so that I could find the perfect gfycat via reddits very own inhouse search [engine.](https://gfycat.com/WideCreamyArcherfish) Yes you [heard](https://gfycat.com/AridDisguisedFrogmouth) me, it is actually functional. So I basically made a searchable database that looks like a subreddit. My [OCD](https://gfycat.com/ImmediateMeanBongo) didn't just rest there, I've tried to also credit the original creator of the gfycats and the source from where I found them. Trying my best to give credit where [credit](https://gfycat.com/RecentIdleAbalone) is due.

[Go ahead](https://gfycat.com/HollowSentimentalHaddock), and give it a [test](https://gfycat.com/SleepyJubilantAmericanwirehair) run. Hopefully, you'll find something for any word you look up. I know I'm not [google](https://gfycat.com/HighPerfectIlladopsis), but for me this was a proof of [concept.](https://gfycat.com/HollowSaneBeaver)

##Disclaimer & Shoutouts

I made /r/GfycatDepot 4 years ago myself. I am in no part affiliated with the gfycat company, nor are they paying me to promote their standard. I want to give a huge shoutout to the great folks and mods over in /r/HighQualityGifs, /r/HQRG, /r/hero0fwar & /r/reactiongifs. Without you fine gif makers my project would not have gotten this far. And for that I want to sincerely thank you.

P.S. I want to also mention I used /r/Cinemagraphs CSS as a ""starting off point"" but I stop since there is a [Digg v4~esc design overhaul](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/digg-v4) coming down the pipes with no [stopping](https://gfycat.com/IllinformedCloudyAfricanporcupine) in sight.",1519218049.0,2018-02-21 14:00:49

The Nintendo 64 is a video game console that was released in late 1996 and early 1997. It was Nintendo's third home video game console, following the NES and the SNES. The N64 revolutionised the gaming scene, with technical capabilities unheard of at the time including 64 bit tech, 3-dimensional graphics, and a massive array of excellent games, including Super Mario 64, The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time, Goldeneye 007, and many, many more. If I were to list al the amazing games on this console, it'd end up taking multiple posts. The N64 was also one of the last cartridge based home consoles; the Gamecube, Nintendo's next console, was disk-based, and the 2000's saw the rise of Xbox and Playstation, which were all disk-based as well. The N64 laid the groundwork for the modern gaming scene, introducing new concepts and ideas that had never been seen before; the gaming scene today would likely be a lot different if it wasn't for the Nintendo 64.


While the Nintendo 64 and its library of games is outclassed by many consoles today, and the behemoth that is the PC, its legacy still lives on in this subreddit. /r/N64 is filled with N64 enthusiasts, whether they be speedrunners, collectors, or people who simply grew up with the console. If you're interested in getting an N64, this is the correct place to go, all the information is on the sidebar. I'd recommend anyone interested in retro gaming to check out this sub, and even buy an N64 if you're really interested. They're not terribly expensive; I, personally, managed to get a console with 3 controllers off of eBay for only £50 (~$70), and games can go for £10-£40 depending on the rarity of the game.



&nbsp;


> **1: Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>> **/u/ZadocPaet** I joined when putting together the Retro Gaming Network.


>> **/u/Splinxyy**  I joined to combine my passion of moderation with my passion of retro games. I was looking for some subs to mod, and u/ZadocPaet was kind enough to let me try out modding here. It's awesome to be here and I honestly love moderating this place.

> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/ZadocPaet** It's super chill. Every now and again there is YouTube spam. Sometimes there is some flaming or trolling. But really, there's not much to worry about here. Just people who love N64.

>> **/u/Splinxyy** It's a really enjoyable experience. Most of the content is approvable, and the other mods (and hopefully me too) do an amazing job at weeding out the posts that just don't fit to ensure the sub is a spam free place for everyone.


> **3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **/u/ZadocPaet** This one is just so glorious. https://i.imgur.com/PLAxjk1.jpg

>> **/u/Splinxyy** Honestly, it would have to be [this image of paper mario.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/7weyd9/paper_mario_ad_from_a_2001_comic_book/) I remember buying my first console and the store was packed with things like this. I remember an actual Paper Mario sticker book, and though I wasn't able to buy it I do remember me trying to sneak it onto the counter (haha!). One of my earliest and fondest memories.


> **4: What's your connection to the N64? Did you pick it up randomly online, or did you have one at childhood, etc?**

>> **/u/ZadocPaet** I picked up my first N64 on March 5th, 2001.

>> **/u/Splinxyy** I wasn't around for the initial release of N64, but I have spent countless hours playing N64's. I love retro games, whether it be the Atari line of consoles, Spektrums', N64's - you get the idea. I have a huge emulation station set up with some controllers right next to me as we speak, and I also plan on investing on a real N64 as well - it's going to be the highlight of my year.



 > **5: What are your favourite games on the N64, and what ones would you recommend to anyone wishing to get stated with the console?**

>> **/u/ZadocPaet** Obviously check out Mario 64, LoZ: Ocarina of Time, and Smash Bros. I'd recommend Diddy Kong Racing over Mario Kart 64. Also Perfect Dark over GoldenEye 007. For a true hidden jem import Sin and Punishment.

>> **/u/Splinxyy** To be honest, it has to be Mario 64. It is one of my favourite games of all time - there is so much to do and explore! I've completed it countless times and enjoyed every ounce of the game. For anyone who wants to get started, I would say before you buy an N64, if you're not sure, I would recommend buying an old Raspberry Pi model and a USB to N64 controller and trying out the N64 on an emulator. If you like it, get the real thing, but they can be expensive so it's best to try before you buy!


>**6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/ZadocPaet** It's not broken.

>> **/u/Splinxyy** I hope to expand the variety of content we provide here on the sub. Don't get me wrong - the content is already fantastic, but I would like newcomers to have a wider range of things to delve into upon arriving at the sub. I have plans to run some community events and megathreads too, and possibly even start a discord server if that is something people would be interested


> **7: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/ZadocPaet** Yes, this: https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/3knhpz/n64_analog_stick_repair/


>> **/u/Splinxyy** You took my post conal. Why? I was going to do this D: *

Oftentimes it's a good thing to shoot for the moon, try and do the best you can possibly do. This is the mentality a lot of people have, and generally, it works. However, some people interpret it as ""I should not have to settle for anything below my desired goal"", forgetting that, often, they're probably not going to reach that desired goal because they're going way out of their depth. 




That's what /r/ChoosingBeggars is for. This sub is based around the old saying ""beggars can't be choosers"", which essentially means that you should accept an offer when its given to you, if it's the best one you have. In other words, it means you should settle for what's being given to you. The people highlighted on this sub obviously have never heard this idiom before, as it's filled with solid 2s asking for nothing less than a 6'5"", super fit, rich, kind, 8.5"" man. 





The sub is funny, as it's amusing to see such delusional people, whether it's simply asking too much in a sexual partner, [denying multiple people offering their help for free] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/7kr5as/i_need_a_free_100mile_bus_trip_for_20_people_and/), [asking for free commisions because they're going to get *soo much publicity*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/7mvir2/no_no_you_misunderstand_its_an_honor_for_you_to/), and [literally choosing beggars] (https://i.imgur.com/T6002R3.jpg). It's an excellent sub to binge, and I highly recommend you all check it out!

*""Jesus Christ, Reddit. What the fuck.""*



&nbsp;



That's what /r/JesusChristReddit is for. This place is filled with posts that just make you think ""what the actual fuck"". I'm repeating myself a lot here, but there isn't really any other way to describe the stuff on this sub other than ""what the fuck"" and ""Jesus Christ"". You have people [joking about child rape] (https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/631eem/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_your_personal/dfr2d5l/?context=100), [necrophilia] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5c79n0/you_can_have_sex_with_one_real_person_from_all_of/d9uf56l/?context=1) (SFWish, don't worry), [editing gifs from /r/watchpeopledie] (https://np.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/5yftsi/an_11yr_old_student_falling_to_his_death_down_a/depoydo/?context=3), [Anne Frank pregnancy erotica] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5dbquj/what_are_some_nsfw_history_facts_that_do_not_get/da3j9m0/?context=1), [Jesus Christ erotica] (https://np.reddit.com/r/SnapLenses/comments/7t0fy9/should_i_finish_im_working_on_a_lens_where_it/dt9fs29/?context=3), [more Jesus Christ erotica] (https://np.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/76nths/try_another_hole_philip/dofkfng/?context=3)... There's a lot of creepy erotica.


The content on this sub is quite varied, but it's all for the same effect: To shock the reader/viewer. It's interesting how we find stuff like this entertaining, the sheer shock value providing sufficient. This sub strikes a balance between being shocking, and being shocking *for the sake of being shocking*. It isn't exactly tame, but isn't the cringefest of edgyness that is /r/ImgoingToHellForThis. I'd recommend this sub to anyone that appreciates a little bit of dark humour, and even if you don't, I still think it's worth a look.

You are on a trip with some friends out to an island out in the Atlantic for the summer. The wind blows through your hair and the sun gently kisses your skin while you get the scuba gear on. Jumping in, the chilly water engulfs you on this hot day. Your friends calls you over as they pear down an underwater cliff. Thinking nothing of it, everyone slowly begin your descend into the dark. Once at the bottom, your stomach churns as the dark shadow of something looms ahead. Drawing closer, the outline of a large submarine fills your view. The side has been ripped open and its internal components are spilled out on the sea floor. Suddenly, you start to panic and clamber away back to the surface.


Most people most likely have not heard about submechanophobia. So what is it? Submechanophobia is the fear of partially or fully submerged man made objects. Some classic examples would be the wrecked pirate ship with its hull sticking up out of the water, the Titanic, or the Costa Concordia. Some could say that this is related to Thalassophobia, the fear of large bodies of water and the unknown that lies in it, but this time you know what monstrosity lurks just below. 


This sub appears to have an interesting collection of users. Some find the images fascinating or interesting, while other actually have submechanophobia. It is truly terrifying to think of being on the sunken ships or other objects as they went down. The decomposing structures and limited lightly only make everything more eerie.

**Below are some comments by the moderators:**

>#1. Where did you think this sub would end up when you first joined and where do you think it will go now?

>> **[b0nd4g3](/u/b0nd4g3):** I joined the mod team at 2,000 subs and only expected to see minimal growth, I mean I was happy enough with the community engagement at that level, but I could never have expected that such a niche interest would attract over 70,000 users.

>#2. What is your favorite aspect of this sub?

>> **[b0nd4g3](/u/b0nd4g3):** I love the difference in people here. Roughly 2/3rds of our users are here for the beautiful/unusual pictures and only 1/3 are here because they are made genuinely uncomfortable by some of the posts. Then you have experts like divers, people in the Navy etc right the way down to curious onlookers. It really makes for some interesting posts and conversations.

>#3. What has your experience moderating /r/submechanophobia been like during your time here?

>> **[b0nd4g3](/u/b0nd4g3):** Tranquil I suppose. Everyone has their own job and does it well, the community doesn't need to be moderated with a heavy hand since there is nothing controversial posted and all our users absolutely love this subreddit, so much that we haven't had to even think about promoting ourselves, our users attract more through word of mouth alone.

>#4. What would you do if you saw a dark shadow of something reach out of the ocean in the black of night?

>> **[b0nd4g3](/u/b0nd4g3):** I am in the 'scared shitless' camp in this subreddit, I'd absolutely hate it, freeze up and lose control of my faculties before swimming away as quickly as possible. Conversely, that scenario sounds like heaven for many of our users.

>#5. Is there anything you would like to say to the community?

>> **[b0nd4g3](/u/b0nd4g3):** Just thank you, it's all 100% down to you, your posts and your comments that we have the thriving community we do.

With over 33,000 species, fish are the most diverse vertebrate clade. Present from pole to pole, occupying the deepest trenches and the highest lakes, they form a crucial role within the Earth's biosphere. To billions of people, they provide a source of food, income, and fascination. For creatures with a simple physiology and a humble appearance, they hold an undeniable importance to the Earth.

With this in mind, r/fish was recently revised as a place to discuss them.

After a long decline, the subreddit has been revived with a new mod team just under a year ago. Since the revival, the subreddit has received a steady increase in the number of subscribers and active posters, forging a friendly community who are open to discuss a wide range of topics concerning the fascinating subject of fish.

r/fish welcomes all pictures, articles, videos, GIFs, text-posts, and comments about fish, both in regards to the natural populations and fisheries, content that was found to be otherwise struggling for space in other subreddits like r/aquariums.

Here are just a few of the notable r/fish posts, serving to showcase some incredible fish:

Dr. Stone is a recently released Japanese Manga serialisation written by Riichiro Inagaki, illustrated by Boichi. It follows the story of High School genius Senku Ishigami and his simple but hardworking best friend Taiju Oki. The series details their struggle to revive humanity after a mysterious crisis has left everyone in the world turned to stone for several millennia. 

/r/DrStone is the hub of discussion for the series on the Reddit Platform, and provides an open, welcoming space for new fans. Upon logging back in, there will never be a time when you don't see some new, engaging post asking a question you didn't think about, sharing awesome artwork that you hadn't found, or just gaping in awe at the best Subreddit Banner in existence. The denizens of /r/DrStone are eager to answer your questions and connect with others who share a love for this charming series. 

The writer approached the Moderators of /r/DrStone with some questions and /u/hitrho5 was gracious enough to answer them for us!

> **What are some aspects of Dr Stone that you think would appeal to the average reader?**
>>**/u/hitrho5:**
> First off, the artwork. Boichi's art style is very detailed and unique, which allows Dr. Stone to stand out aesthetically in Weekly Shonen Jump. Another aspect would be originality. On the subreddit's sidebar, I describe the series as a ""post-apocalyptic stone age science shonen manga."" I can't imagine there being any other manga out there with that sort of concept. While the series mainly focuses on science, Inagaki does good job balancing it with comedy and action to keep the reader consistently entertained.

> **What is your favourite aspect of the new, but flourishing community at /r/DrStone ?**
>>**/u/hitrho5:**
> In terms of content, that would be seeing all of the positive feedback for the manga in the comments. Also, the subbredit’s banner is pretty hilarious. /u/Weaper12 did a great job with it.

> **Do you have any favourite submissions?**
>>**/u/hitrho5:**
> There are 2 that stand out to me. One is [this bust of Senku](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrStone/comments/7fp76n/faces_of_senku_bust_sculpt/) made by one of the users. 3D art isn’t common in this sort of community, so it’s cool to see something like this every now and then. The other is a [fan theory about Senku’s parents](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrStone/comments/7nhqs2/theory_senkus_parents/) someone made after reading chapter 41. Unfortunately, part of it has been rendered false by the chapter that followed, but only time will tell if the remainder ends up being true.

> I know I’ve kinda said this before, but thank you all for your part in making this community what it is. I may have created this subreddit, and we mods may be the ones responsible for maintaining it, but it’s the content you all post and the discussion you all generate that allows /r/DrStone to thrive and what brought us to our recent 1000 subscriber milestone. I’ve really enjoyed reading the manga and moderating the subreddit these past 10 months, and I look forward to continue doing both for the foreseeable future.


**The Writer has chosen a selection of submissions that they think are some of the best that /r/DrStone has to offer:**

- **[I drew the Kingdom of Science Trio!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrStone/comments/763fi2/i_drew_the_science_kingdom_trio/)**

- **[Dr Stone Volume 4 Cover](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrStone/comments/7tpasd/dr_stone_volume_4_cover/)**

- **[Here are Boichi's answers to your questions about Dr Stone!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrStone/comments/7bwsvm/herere_boichis_answers_to_your_questions_about_dr/)**

So why not come on down to /r/DrStone if you're already reading the series or interested in picking it up. I've read it myself and would certainly recommend it (Trump gets meme'd in the first chapter).

/r/KaiserReich is a subreddit created for the Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg mod, which is a mod for Hearts of Iron 2, Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game, and Hearts of Iron 4.


The subreddit, while having less than 15,000 subscribers, is one of the most active I have seen yet. The level of creativity that can be seen is absolutely astounding. It is a subreddit for an obscure mod of an obscure game in an obscure genre, but nearly 4-500 people are online constantly. It contains people of all political ideologies, yet has no problems containing it. The memes posted there are also top-notch, some of the funniest yet most obscure I have ever seen. If you don't know the lore surrounding the alternate timeline, see their wiki at http://kaiserreich.wikia.com/wiki/The_Kaiserreich_Wiki. While everything is about obscure politicians, most people on the subreddit get the jokes and it can create some of the most interesting times you'll see.



There are lots of excellent and funny posts on the sub. Here are just some of the recent things- https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/7vvacr/kaiserreich_dating_sim_a_serious_proposal/

An entire dating Simulator being created by members of the community for free and with simply the willpower of the people, essentially started based of a joke within the community. I am on the dev team, so I can tell you that progress is being made.


https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/7vxazl/i_drew_the_commune_of_france_as_an_anime_girl_no/?st=jdezw22k&sh=31c345b9 
Art inspired by nothing but an alternate-history scenario for a grand strategy game.

And a near constant supply of memes. Seriously, 70% of it is memes, and fairly good quality ones at that, if you understand the background behind it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/7w4myh/marketsocialistnationalauthoritariansocialpaternal/ Radical Centrism

https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/7w02dc/wholesome_rkaiserreich_picardia/ A wholesome meme about what kind of community it is

https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/7w2ez6/every_comic_an_existential_comic/?st=jdf00tyw&sh=4f1c383f A variation of every ideology a ""blank"", a running joke

https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/7vtis3/every_man_a_defeated_coup_story_i_worked_really/?st=jdf02ge2&sh=5bb6f408

Literature about some people's games within the mod.



If you play Hearts of Iron, and are interested in mods & alternate history, I highly recommend checking this mod out.

**12,573** N'wahs for **1 era**!



&nbsp;


/r/TESLore? Weak shit. This is where the true ***L O R E*** can be found. /r/TrueSTL is a sub where only the most CHIM'd out n'wahs gather, to discuss our enlightened truths. To browse this sub is to get a glimpse into the mind of the [One True God] (https://i.redd.it/zqwpliolw52z.png).


The sub is based on the famous video game series Skyrim. The first Skyrim came out in 2011, also known as the start of civilisation. While the series has had its ups and downs, especially in Skyrim 1's prequel, Oblivion, which didn't even feature Morrowind, it's commonly referred to as one of the best franchises of all time. Fans have been patiently awaiting the release of Skyrim 6 for many years now, which will hopefully include more Morrowind and less of that weird snowy place that nobody really cared about. 

There have been many Skyrims over the kalpas, including:
 
* Skyrim 1

* Skyrim 2: The Squeakquel

* Skyrim 3: Revenge of the Sil

* Skyrim 4: Wild Hunt

* TES III: Morrowind

* Skyrim 5: New Vegas (2/10, no Vivec, just some weird computer guy)


I highly recommend picking up these games if you can. Most Khajiit will have them if you have coin. Don't play Skyrim: Zero Dawn though, the robots aren't even clockwork.


&nbsp;



># 1:  Why did you start/join the subreddit?

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** I have some trouble with the chronological order here, but six years ago, I was one of the most active users on the four Elder Scrolls-related subreddits /r/Morrowind, /r/TESlore, /r/Skyrim and /r/shittyTESlore (the predecessor of /r/TrueSTL that started around my most active time five years ago). However, /r/shittyTESlore became kinda lazy and me and some other active users didn’t agree with the way it was going, so we put up our own Ghostfence and started swit-posting in it.

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** I was a power user in /r/ShittyTESlore, the now-defunct predecessor to /r/TrueSTL. Once it became clear that the migration was taking place, becoming a /r/TrueSTL power user was the only course of action.

>> **/u/Avian81** I fucking loved memes, and I fucking loved the Elder Scrolls. At that point it wasn't even a question of why, it was only a question of when. I originally joined reddit for /r/teslore, but I found myself more engulfed in the trap that is /r/TrueSTL

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** I heard about it in one of the TES subreddits. It seemed fun so I joined the shitposting. And later I somehow became a moderator.

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** I started out as an active user on /r/teslore, and sort of got dragged into this. I posted just a few things, and still don't really understand how I got to be a moderator.

># 2: What's moderating the sub like?

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** I haven’t been “active” on reddit in months, since my interest in Elder Scrolls has decreased. I still play Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim from time to time, but I feel like I squeezed every meme-potential out of the games. The happier and prouder I feel that /r/TrueSTL seems to be more active and funnier than ever. I love my mod team to death – especially /u/Avian81 who seems to be the most active of the “old bunch” - as well as the old and new users of /r/TrueSTL. Despite me not commenting on anything, I visit the subreddit daily to have a laugh and upvote the good shit.

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** 92% of the time it moderates iteslf, save the rare hate speech and whatnot we need to snap up. If there were much work to be done, most of the mods would be moderating instead of circlejerking in backrooms. Please don't make there be more work, I love circlejerking in backrooms <3

>> **/u/Avian81** Absolute cancer. They fucking tiptoe the god damned border between banter and outright calls for racial genocide on a daily basis and it becomes hard to keep track at times. Im kidding of course, this place is a beautiful mess but holy shit do people need to get more creative with their post titles.

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** It's usually lazy and there isn't much work to do, but sometimes we have to deal with Dissident Priests insurgencies and ~~bring out the banhammer~~ lock them up in the Ministry of Truth. We ensure that our lore is up to the highest standards.

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** Fuck if I know.

># 3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/2m01pt/the_nerevarine_browses_rteslore/ https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/5vylln/artists_depiction_of_the_disappearance_of_the/ https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/66wnxj/my_vah/ https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/58gl05/my_life_is_just_one_big_steaming_pile_of/ https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/5s412l/rekt/

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** Literally impossible to beat the [36 Rages of Vivec](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/38srar/the_36_rages_of_vivec/). Shut up, I'm not biased, they're a great introduction to the deep lore of Morrowind.

>> **/u/Avian81** Any of the circlejerked le lore facts guides that get posted to other subreddit, those are the shit. Whenever they get posted to other subs or boards people get confused as my boner whenever i see Vivec(female). There's also the fact that whenever they're posted they bring a lot of traffic to the sub which also helps :/)
Few examples of what I mean: http://i.imgur.com/74iNRBt.jpg http://i.imgur.com/X6x5NhV.png

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** I always liked [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/2m01pt/the_nerevarine_browses_rteslore/). IMO, it's a perfect example of what TrueSTL's humor should be. Also, basically anything by /u/OccupyTamriel (Godd rest his soul).

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** [the 36 rages of Vivec](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/38srar/the_36_rages_of_vivec/) are still my favourites.


># 4: Which Skyrim was your favourite?

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** Tomb Raider II

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** fuck yourself x3

>> **/u/Avian81** The one for the PC. Upvotes to the left XXXXDDDDDD

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** FIFA 2016. It adds so much to the lore.

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** Hello Kitty's Island Adventure. Fite me.

># 5: Which God is your favourite God, and why is it Sotha Sil?

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** I just bought the Vivec FunkoPop figure or whatever they are called so I am a bit biased. I also like clean spears.

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** It's Sotha Sil because he's manifested an extremely deep understanding of the concept of metaphysical ""love"" - divorced from Vivec's overboard understanding that turns him into a homicidal maniac, and also from Almalexia's watered-down understanding that turns her into a narcissistic queen.

>> Haha, just fuckin' with you, it's cos of his robo legs

>> **/u/Avian81** I'm sorry? I didn't hear that over Sotha Sil's inane rambling and BEING DEAD. Jyggalag is obviously the most powerful deity in all of Mundus. Imagine being so powerful that all the other daedric penises need to team up just to even beat you, and he's so powerful he can even beat himself up every era and fucking win.
He will be relevant again in TES6 when it comes out in 2071 to commemorate Todd Howard's 100th birth day and Skyrim's 50th rerelease.

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** It's Dagoth Ur. Why? HE'S A GOD. HOW CAN YOU KILL A GOD? What a grand and intoxicating innocence. How could you be so naive? There is no escape. No Recall or Intervention can work in this place. Come. Lay down your weapons. It is not too late for his mercy.

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** Vehk is love. Vehk is life.


># 6: When the girls aren't around, what's your REAL opinion on the Slaughter of Lilmoth in 4E 40?

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** Despite me being very interested in the lore, I never heard of that event or forgot about it, so I tip my Colovian Fur Helm to your research, m’lorebeard.

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** C0DA means that all lore introduced after TES IV is just fanfiction. You can keep protending that Argonians are anything but literally perfect if you want to, just know that I know that you're full of shit.

>> **/u/Avian81** Non-humans DO NOT matter.

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** I think it's a shame that so many perfectly usable Argonian slaves died.

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** I don't read lizard propaganda.

># 7: Could Vivec beat Sheogorath in a fistfight? Asking for a friend.

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** Despite me being very interested in the lore, I never heard of that event or forgot about it, so I tip my Colovian Fur Helm to your research, m’lorebeard.

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** Fist fight? No. *Fisting* fight? Yes.

>> **/u/Avian81** This actually raises an interesting question on whether or not CHIM is strong enough to fucking erase and destroy daedra and aedra. We're never really given a concrete answer. We know that Vivec can make people Gods but we don't know if he can make Gods irrelevant. He managed to beat several Daedra multiple times but never to the point that they become forgotten forever and worship of them ceases permanently. Or has he?

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** I think a muatra fight would be more interesting. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** I think Vivec's right hand is a bit pre-occupied, but who knows? He might be a lefty.

># 8: Do you get to the Cloud District very often?

>> **/u/OccupyTamriel** Yes.

>> **/u/Qu1nlan** 
Have you seen my ring?

>> **/u/Avian81** I understand Daedra worship has become increasingly prevalent in the Summerset Isle.

>> **/u/hidden_heathen** Here's the thing. you said a ""do you get to the Cloud District very often?""

>> Is it a meme? Yes. No one's arguing that.

>> As someone who is a loremaster who studies lore, I am saying, specifically, in lore, no one references Skyrim memes. If you wanted to be ""humorous"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

>> If you were saying ""you n'wah"" you would be referring to the meme grouping of Morrowind, which includes things from the 36 Lessons of Vivec.

>> So your reasoning for saying ""do you get to the Cloud District very often"" is because random people ""call it the best meme?"" Let's get ""criminal scum"" and ""sweetroll"" in there, then, too.

>> Also, calling someone a loremaster or a CHIMster? It's not one or the other, that's not how lore works. They're both. A loremaster is a loremaster and a member of the TES lore society. But that's not what you said. you referenced the Cloud district meme, which is not lore unless you're okay with calling all memes of the Skyrim family lore, which means you would call ""FUS-RO-DAH"", ""arrow in the knee"", and other memes lore, too. Which you said you didn't.

>> It's okay to just admit you are an n'wah, you know?

>> **/u/Hollymarkie** Only on Skooma.

House Redoran are fucking trash.

AMD has probably one of the best and funniest fanbases in the world. What is /r/AyyMD then? Well, it's quite simple. /r/AyyMD is:
> a satirical PC hardware community dedicated to proving that AMD is clearly the better choice 

^Their ^sidebar 

Yes, you probably already read it in the title. /r/AyyMD is not a serious place, it's rather making fun of ""Shintel"" (Intel) and ""Novideo"" (Nividea). 

This subreddit is a pure meme subreddit and doesn't take itself serious! We often make fun of [Novideo GPU's exploding](https://i.redd.it/1tquafg1pa101.jpg), [Shintel (Intel) CPU's being too warm](https://www.reddit.com/r/AyyMD/comments/7urte2/shintel_processors_are_so_hot_they_need_blue/), [Shintel being awful](https://i.redd.it/oj6s92mibqd01.jpg) and worship [our AMD-God](https://www.reddit.com/r/AyyMD/comments/7qqoak/shintel_damage_control/)

I would recommend this sub to everyone that likes AMD or just hardware-memes!

/r/EthosLab is a subreddit created for the popular YouTuber EthosLab (/u/ethoslab), a YouTuber with nearly 2 million subscribers, who mainly makes content for the game Minecraft (don't go, please). The subreddit is filled with fans, fan art, ideas for Etho, and more. If you're a fan of Etho, check the sub out. There's not much else to say about the sub, except that the community is nice and the mods are good at what they do.


Now, onto Etho himself. Even if you don't care for Minecraft, he's still an excellent entertainer. I personally haven't played or really cared about Minecraft in at least a year or two, but I still regularly watch Etho. There's something about the way he explains things, his humour, his voice, his technical mindset, his expertise at the game, that all comes together to make his content extremely entertaining and fun to watch. He doesn't swear or anything, but he still doesn't pander to kids like most other Minecraft YouTubers. He's never begged for likes or subs either, which is likely one of the reasons his channel grows so slowly. If you don't like Minecraft, I still recommend checking out his channel. He has a couple of series on his channel, most notably [Etho Plays Minecraft] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAVDbMg_XArcet5lwcRo12Fh9JrGKydh), a vanilla series which is currently at 499 episodes, and [Project Ozone 2] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAVDbMg_XAoIzvMEoPyg7mW0T0gDZezo), a modded Skyblock-esque series. There are other series as well, but Etho is notoriously bad at continuing on letsplays (RIP the modded series, Hermitcraft, Hermitpack, both Terrafirmacraft letsplays, CrackPack, and about 30 other series). 


Again, even if you don't care for Minecraft, try watching at least one of his videos. You never know, you might find one of your favourite YouTubers.

/r/HadtoHurt is not a nice sub to browse for most people. Nobody really *enjoys* seeing people get hurt (if you do, I'd recommend getting some psychiatric evaluation). I can hardly even watch some of the posts on this sub without wincing heavily.



But morbid curiosity keeps bringing me back. And that's what's great about /r/HadToHurt. 



As the name suggests, /r/HadToHurt is a subreddit filled with posts of gifs/images of things that look like they would have really hurt. Stuff like [this] (https://redd.it/6fvv5d), and [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/HadToHurt/comments/7hj1ne/i_think_they_call_this_road_rash/). Keep in mind that it only shows non-lethal injuries (or in other words, there's no death), so you don't have to be worried about that. 


While browsing this sub, you'll laugh, you'll cringe, and most importantly, you'll wince heavily at every post. But you'll keep checking it. It's weird how humans do that, right? Nobody likes getting hurt or seeing others get hurt, but everybody is at least a little fascinated by it.




Keep in mind that this sub isn't just for massively painful things that happen to people; just things that hurt. That's why you get small posts like [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/HadToHurt/comments/7l2p5b/ow_that_mutherfuker/) one and [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/HadToHurt/comments/70mxgy/little_guy_learns_something_about_his_friend/) one (a personal favourite of mine). Overall, this sub has a lot of different themes going on in it, some are funny, some are just plain painful, but they're all somewhat entertaining to the more sadistic of us.

Almost everyone has seen Star Wars. Maybe you've seen the newest Episodes 7 and 8. However, one cannot forget the best episodes of all...2 and 3 in the prequels! (Phantom Menace was ok). The subreddit specialises in memes from Episodes 1, 2 and 3, along with the Clone Wars TV Series(2003 and the more recent one), and Rogue One! (Classifies as prequel canon as it is set before episode 4). The sub has also accomplished a lot; for a while, Emperor Palpatine (aka the Senate) was one of the first pictures on google when you search up ""The Senate"" thanks to our subredditors! The community generally is nice, without a lot of toxicity (unless you are sequel memer. Then a horde of us will burst upon you). Also, if you post a repost, you'll get a friendly ""GENERAL REPOSTI"" comment which is also fun (but seriously, don't repost, its bad taste). If you like Star Wars memes, and do not wish to see any ""ReyLo"" ships, or other stinky Sequel Memes; this is the place for you!


Here is some links to some content on the page.

The page has recently been mocking the ""Ben Swole-o"" sequel meme with pics of muscular prequel gods, like the Senate himself: https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/7upwli/youve_heard_of_qui_gone_gym_now_get_ready_for/ 

And here's Qui Gone Gym: https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/7ujxx7/just_gonna_leave_this_here/

Who could forget the Net Neutrality fight? {-}7 : https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/7er1pr/when_you_finally_give_in_to_temptation_and_use/


Finally, another roast at EA: https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/7cnh1c/mrw_i_find_out_eas_response_is_now_the_most/


There also is this cancerous fusion of a Sequel Meme and Prequel Meme I found...click if you dare: https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/7urwsf/now_this_is_autism/



If you still are looking for reasons why to join the community? Well, we have a dope cursor based off the Senate himself.

Thanks for taking the time to read this article, but what about the droid attack on the wookies? It's a system we can't lose. So, want to try spinning with us?

Everyone gets that lovely feeling in their stomach when that resturant hidden away in the corner promises ""quality"" meals. How about that time the flyer said you would have a ""fun"" time? And the time your boss informed you it was perfectly ""legal"". 

/r/UnnecessaryQuotes is a subreddit for all those signs, PSAs, or announcements with quotes around something that shouldn't have quotes around it. This sub really makes you try and think what someone was thinking when they put those quotes there. Liability? Maybe. It would seem more like bad advertising by scaring away customers. ""Trust us"" Our staff are here to help. On the other hand, the unnecessary quotes would draw more attention and curiosity. Who wouldn't pass up the chance to check out a shop that sells ""exotic butters"". 

In reality, it may be easier to put quotes around something instead of making it bold for certain cases. For example, when printing on a cardboard box. Other cases, it seems to be used as a ""polite"" bold font. As if I am drawing attention to something, but trying not to yell. Hilarity often ensues if placed in the correct context. Come on down to Billy Bill's inflatable jump houses where both kids and parents can have ""fun"". 

It wouldn't hurt to browse this ""subreddit"" called /r/UnnecessaryQuotes. It's good alright; ""accuracy"" is our guarantee.

**Below are some comments from the ""moderators"":**

>#1. What is your ""favorite"" aspect of the community?

>> **[Kmlkmljkl](/u/kmlkmljkl):** I like when people also use unnecessary quotation marks in their comments.

>> **[potatoinmymouth](/u/potatoinmymouth):** I like that people don't take themselves too seriously. At the end of the day we're just a bunch of individuals who despair at the horrors of poor punctuation, which is a pretty tenuous link. That doesn't stop us having fun!


>#2. What has your experience moderating /r/UnnecessaryQuotes been like during your time here?

>> **[Kmlkmljkl](/u/kmlkmljkl):** Other than the occasional repost report it's been fairly quiet.

>> **[potatoinmymouth](/u/potatoinmymouth):** It's quiet. Too quiet. Seriously, though, no drama.

>#3. Do you have a favorite ""un'necessary' quotes"" moment?

>> **[Kmlkmljkl](/u/kmlkmljkl):** This one time while watching a show I noticed a sign that said `""caution""`. I thought that was pretty funny.

>> **[potatoinmymouth](/u/potatoinmymouth):** We crossed into the uncanny valley when they [started appearing in Trump tweets](https://i.imgur.com/1aqg9bx.png).

>#4. What is your explanation for why someone tacked ""unnecessary quotes"" on something?

>> **[Kmlkmljkl](/u/kmlkmljkl):** People seem to think using quotes is the same as making text bold, rather than, y'know, quoting text.

>> **[potatoinmymouth](/u/potatoinmymouth):** I like a quote from Lynne Truss' marvellous book Eats, Shoots and Leaves: ""Someone knows punctuation is required, but where, oh where?""

>#5. Is there anything you would like to say to the community?

>> **[Kmlkmljkl](/u/kmlkmljkl):** Never tell your parents to stop.

>> **[potatoinmymouth](/u/potatoinmymouth):** You're ""great"".

### /r/Ireland 



**150,386** Irishmen and Irishwomen for **9 years**!





&nbsp;





Ireland is a pretty unique place on this earth, for many, many reasons. For one, nobody seems to dislike the country, it's liked by pretty much everybody. It's also home to some of the most beautiful landscapes and environments in the world, and there's nowhere that doesn't really look nice (well, there's Leitrim, but lets just pretend Leitrim doesn't exist for a sec). 


Also, the craic is fucking ninety.



/r/Ireland is, of course, a place for Irishmen and Irishwomen to come and discuss various Irish topics, like the shite weather (which, I may add, is the reason the country looks as nice as it does), whether the north Tayto are better than the south Tayto (they fucking aren't by the way), make fun of politics, make fun of Cork, make fun of Britain *^^^[cough](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_IRA)*, and most importantly, have some fun.




The sub, like the people themselves, isn't particularly serious about anything, it's mainly just people [posting memes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/7pwfvr/eric_andre_is_for_a_united_ireland/) and [making jokes] (http://imgur.com/U5BBJsH). You get the occasional serious political post (there are a good lot of political shitposts though), but overall it's a community which is just a bit of craic.




However, this isn't just for memes and shit, it is a very helpful community for anyone wishing to visit Ireland, or who have an interest in Irish culture. There's a fuck ton of information in the sidebar, a sticky at the top of the sub for people visiting, and if you have any other questions you can just ask away and people will be happy to help you out. All in all, it's an excellent sub that represents all the good parts of Irish culture (modern Irish culture, not all that shite the plastic paddys go on about to excuse their drinking problem).

&nbsp;




An elaborate political simulation of the British House of Commons and House of Lords (and Stormont and Holyrood), complete with elections, referendums and legislature. There are political parties, votes, referendums, and much more! 




Multiple parties exist, and try to win seats in elections with an intricate election system that rewards term time activity and campaigning at election time. Those parties then seek to form governments and opposition coalitions and get their policies implemented.


Every view from communism to neoconservatism has a place in the alphabet soup of parties, and players are encouraged to set their own goals in a political sandbox.

Humanity has come a long way in its relatively short existence on Earth. We've developed speech, worked out how to make tools and use them to our advantage, found out that hitting special rocks together can make fire, realised we could take seeds and put them in the ground to get lots of food easily, created societies, created metals and explosives and wires that conduct electricity through them to make the explosives explode and harnessed the explosives to make things go super fucking high and then strapped people to those things and sent them to the fucking moon.


Or in other words, humanity is intelligent. We've made advancements in recent times that we would have thought impossible only a few centuries ago or even just decades ago. We're a rather intelligent species. 

But sometimes, you see something so utterly stupid that it makes you question if we've really come *that* far.



/r/Facepalm is a subreddit that archives some of the stupidest things said on the Internet by actual human beings. Things that will make you facepalm (hence the name). It makes you wonder how the people that said those things managed to get jobs and work out how to afford housing.


In this sub you'll find a wide range of stupidity. You have people [not understanding the basics of  how light works] (https://redd.it/7nwxsc), [people forgetting how being blind works] (https://redd.it/6t9y92), [NASA deniers] (https://redd.it/59lxs2), and just [regular old stupidity] (https://redd.it/765wa5). It's a fun place if you feel you have too many brain cells.

Some days we all need some cuteness to brighten the day or purge our minds of the darkest broom closets on Reddit. /r/aww and /r/eyebleach may be perfect for your cute kitties and puppies, but what about when you want something without paws? 

In /r/LilGrabbies, you will find an assortment of animals from rats to hamsters to otters. There is one thing you will find in common however. Tiny little animal hands. These mini human-like hands seem to always be busy doing something, whether it be climbing, eating, gesturing, fighting, more eating, or having a little dance with a human. 

---

**Below are some comments by the moderator of /r/LilGrabbies:**

>#1. What lead you to create this sub?

>>**[Thonster](/u/Thonster):**  The origin of r/LilGrabbies can be found in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/646u9u/this_otter_plays_like_a_dog/). A discussion about hands was started and I realized there weren't any dedicated subs to that type of content. (Surprising, considering reddit's knack for specialized subs about anything imaginable!) I couldn't come up with a good name until u/sprinklerarms suggested LilGrabbies, after which I took the initiative and created it!

>#2. What has your experience moderating /r/LilGrabbies been like during your time here?  

>>**[Thonster](/u/Thonster):**  It's been a great experience for a new mod like me. It's normally a very peaceful endeavor. Now and then we get the occasional rule break but most of the time it's just somebody missing the rule about no cats. Honestly the most challenging part of enforcing the rules is figuring out which animals should be allowed and which shouldn't be. Most of the time it's cut and dry but occasionally someone posts an unusual animal that walks the line between paw and hand, and it's tough to figure out which is closer. We've gotten quite large pretty quickly and I've been considering bringing in another mod, but I'm not sure where to look. Sub traffic certainly isn't unmanageable but it'd be nice to have someone watch my back while I'm asleep or busy elsewhere.

>#3. What is your favorite aspect of the community?  

>>**[Thonster](/u/Thonster):**  I'm not sure what my favorite part is, but certainly an unexpected aspect of the community was how the people from r/RATS seem to have taken a shine to r/LilGrabbies. Going into it, rats hadn't even sprung to mind as potential grabbers but they've since become a staple of our sub. They're a very dedicated bunch, and it's unmistakable how much they love their little buddies. <3

>#4. Do you have any favorite submissions?

>>**[Thonster](/u/Thonser):**  As much as the rats warm my heart, my favorite submissions would have to be anything featuring otters. I think the core of what I like about the little hands is a similar feeling I get from r/likeus, which is a reminder that in some ways, we're really not all that different from animals. Otters in particular have hands that look remarkably like ours, with fat little fingers and a predisposition to grab stuff.

>#5. If you could be any animal here, which one would it be and why?

>>**[Thonster](/u/Thonster):** While being an otter would be pretty sweet, I'd probably prefer being a sugar glider. Soaring around on air currents looks like too much fun!

>#6. Is there anything you would like to say to the community?

>>**[Thonster](/u/Thonster):** There isn't too much to say other than that I'm happy so many of you have found joy in the sub. It's gone from what I at first assumed was a niche appreciation to closing in on 25 000 subscribers! The sub wouldn't be what it is without you guys making it such a pleasant place. You all really are a good bunch. <3 Keep being you and together we'll make sure there's a home for grabbies for a long time to come. :)

/r/PoliceChases is about police chases, as the name of the subreddit implies. Police chases is the vehicular hot pursuit of suspects by law enforcers. The rise of the automotive industry increased car ownership leading to a growing number of criminals attempting to evade police in their own vehicle or a stolen car.

From moderator /u/IsaacEiland-Hall


Good content on the sub: Obviously police chases, but the sub rules include ""police action"". Most of what gets upvoted is actually police chases, but we do allow the occasional non-chase. Before I was a moderator, for example, I posted a video of a police escort of an ambulance from one hospital to another and it did well.

&nbsp;





Whenever something moves across the surface of the earth it leaves clues of its passage. Little puzzles are left for us to uncover and solve. Tracking is a great excuse to get out in nature and explore. It is invaluable in search and rescue, hunting, and understanding the ecology of the ecosystems around us. Tracking gives us a glimpse into the lives of animals that we rarely get to see outside of National Geographic, and allows us a better connection with the natural world. 

Have you ever wondered who made those tracks, or that [den](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalTracking/comments/7ql4ht/any_ideas/)? Would you like to know if a spot is right for setting up a trail cam? Are you interested in SAR, hunting, tactical tracking, or do you just want a better understanding of the natural environment around you? No matter what you find, from [grizzly](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalTracking/comments/61x9w2/grizzly_bear_tracks_in_northern_bc/) to [squirrel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalTracking/comments/788mot/grey_squirrel_transfer_of_dew_onto_a_road_this/) we’re interested. Whether you've been tracking for years, or are just starting to wonder what's in your back yard, welcome to [r/AnimalTracking](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalTracking/).

Many of us have been collecting for years, and others for maybe only a few days but we all have someting in common! We collect the same things! [Steelbooks](https://i.redd.it/svvmg9a4bta01.jpg)!

You know those [metal packageing you see in the DVD isles at your favorite electronics store](https://imgur.com/PZgln1L)? Those are what we love to collect! 

As far as [video games](https://i.redd.it/vv61je2mlkuz.jpg), they are always acceptable! Any kind of steelbook, or really special types of packaging we love to see! I am a avid gamer and movie watcher. 

Now, as far as favorite posts go, the best definitely have to be the [pictures](https://i.redd.it/pmxh3rp9fd301.jpg) of [collections](http://imgur.com/a/y6CQv). I love seeing what everyone collects. Even the most avid [collector](https://i.redd.it/9xzts9lxns001.jpg) can find something new by looking at others [collections](https://i.redd.it/xbfcg4u26txy.jpg). It's happened to me more times than I could probably count. Also seeing what people pick up or get in the mail is always find to see because everyone is always excited to add a new or a few new steelbooks to their collection!


We have collectors from all over the world. Collectors from the UK, Finland, Germany, USA, Canada and even Japan! Once you buy one, its hard to stop. Like we say, you will love collecting them but your wallet (and significant other) wont! Come pay us a visit, or even better, become one of us!

Sometimes in life, things just don't go as planned. Sometimes that's a good thing, usually it's a bad thing, often resulting in embarrassment or even financial loss. But let's all be glad that we've never had to experience a failure as utterly terrible as the posts in /r/CatastrophicFailure.



/r/CatastrophicFailure is pretty self explanatory. It is a subreddit highlighting some of the biggest failures & fuckups caught on camera. Not small stuff like someone saying something really embarrassing on stage, or your grandmother falling down the stairs, no. Stuff like [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/7dtzlw/railroad_trestle_in_texas_collapses_due_to_fire/), and [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/78bzyc/oil_rig_accidentally_drills_into_a_salt_mine/). *That* kind of massive. The kind in which causes massive financial loss, loss of life, and in some cases, ecological disasters.



&nbsp;


>**1: Why did you start/join the subreddit?**

>> **/u/007T** I started the subreddit mostly because I didn't see a subreddit quite like it and I thought there should be one. There were some subreddits with similar themes like /r/nononono or /r/Whatcouldgowrong but I felt like there was something missing in those.  

>**2: What's moderating the sub like?**

>> **/u/007T** It's not been bad to moderate because our users tend to post high quality content with interesting discussions, the majority of moderation goes into preventing spammers and bots or fixing titles.   

>**3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**

>> **/u/007T** This is always a tough question, and my favorites probably change all the time. Our 1 and 2 year anniversary posts were some of my personal favorites: [The complete story of the Chernobyl accident in photographs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/4jzoqd/the_complete_story_of_the_chernobyl_accident_in/) and [Aftermath of the Oroville Dam Spillway incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/5x3daa/aftermath_of_the_oroville_dam_spillway_incident/), or the latest installment of weekly plane crashes: [The crash of Southern Airways flight 242: Analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/7q58ju/the_crash_of_southern_airways_flight_242_analysis/), and there's nothing quite like [an exploding Delta II rocket](https://gfycat.com/sandybriefclam)

>**4: Why do you think people like seeing catastrophic failures like the ones on your sub?**

>> **/u/007T** I imagine people come here for many different reasons. Sometimes it's just morbid curiosity, an interest in history or the engineering aspects of failures. Sometimes it's just just the unique aspect of seeing massive complicated things going completely wrong. 

>**5: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**

>> **/u/007T** I would not have predicted 2 years ago that we'd have a quarter million subscribers now, I don't think I can possibly predict where the future will take it. I'll just continue to try and improve the moderation and rules to raise the standard of posts. 

>**6: Anything else you want to add?**

>> **/u/007T** I'll end by saying that new visitors should be aware that there's occasionally imagery or content some people may find disturbing on our subreddit.

**12,578** people for **1 month!**

The creation of r/HumanReflexes was inspired by r/DadReflexes.  Dads do have some mind-blowing reflexes that we believe they are not human anymore. r/HumanReflexes puts all the actual humans in the spotlights. Because human reflexes are still impressive.

&nbsp;

> A **reflex, or reflex action**, is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus.

&nbsp;

In most situations, you reflexes work as a fail-safe. When you put your body in danger it will force you out of that situation, or at least tries to. This might be better known as [fight](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanReflexes/comments/7p5v1q/fight_or_flight/) or [flight]( https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanReflexes/comments/7laqe9/what_reaction_is_faster_than_a_reflex_reaction/). 

&nbsp;

Whilst reflexes primarily being a fail-safe, it occasionally kicks in during day to day activities. Totally unnecessary other than making you look cool in public. [catching a bullet casing out of the air?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanReflexes/comments/7l91e7/top_tier_reflexes_youll_need_as_a_soldier/) Why? Why not. [Catching a baseball fresh of the bat?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanReflexes/comments/7m8szv/did_you_catch_that_a_closeup_version/) and the crowd goes wild!

**18,237** planeteers for **1 month!**

Earthchan is an anthropomorphic anime style representation of the earth. Originating from a tweet by @trinimmortal it blew up in /r/animemes, earthchan has had many variations but always shared a common theme. Her hair is green and blue with the green parts resembling the land masses of the earth and the blue representing the water. Earthchan likes to wear NASA shirts when she is feeling casual but on school days, she wears a white Japanese school uniform with galaxy/space themed skirt and neckerchief. Earth chan always insists that she is not flat much to the amusement of the other planet girls. Earthchan also hates when humans pollute her but despite all the terrible things that the humans have done, she remains infatuated with humans.

Most of r/earthchan 's content are fanart and memes but
we at r/earthchan want's the sub to be more meaningful so we added resources on the sidebar that links our readers to resources that help the environment. 

some exceptional links from our sub:

**173** expert sleuths for **4 months!**

/r/inoticed is mostly a comedic subbreddit about subtle things that some notice but not most. It really is about pointing out things in the world, that one might not notice at first glance.  This can include [Nicolas Cage](https://www.reddit.com/r/inoticed/comments/7o6ch2/i_noticed_that_nicolas_cage_is_there_for_science/) on some European text book, to [Grandpa](https://www.reddit.com/r/inoticed/comments/7f35lt/i_noticed_that_grandpa_was_ready_for_thanksgiving/) in his underwear at Thanksgiving Dinner, or even just the little detail about a [Gif](https://www.reddit.com/r/inoticed/comments/7kx7u6/i_noticed_the_little_notch_on_the_back_of_the_log/) that was on the frontpage.

inoticed is also a place for discussion about matters that some notice in society. For example how [cigarettes](https://www.reddit.com/r/inoticed/comments/7kxwih/i_noticed_a_lot_more_americans_smoking_lately_irl/) are making a come back into American Television again. Or how the [mannequins](https://www.reddit.com/r/inoticed/comments/7ah98o/i_noticed_these_north_and_south_korean_mannequins/) on the North/South Korean DMZ aren't actually mannequins. 

[r/inoticed's](https://www.reddit.com/r/inoticed/) hope is to point out the little details in life that some might not notice, and to share in it's beauty.

**18,519** bombers *duding around* for **7 years**!

Giant Bomb is a community forum/website created by former GameSpot editors Jeff Gerstmann and Ryan Davis that provides a wide reaching and open space for video game culture and the people who are a part of it. By extension, /r/giantbomb is the sites' representation on the Reddit Platform. It acts as a sort of Meta Discussion Platform for the goings on in Giant Bomb, and a way for the wider Reddit community to be introduced to the community. 

/r/giantbomb often hosts AMA's with Giant Bomb Staff, Founders and other significant figures in the industry, provides links to the social media outlets of community staff and presenters and has a host of willing users ready to get you up to speed on anything Giant Bomb related.

**Below are some comments from the Moderators of /r/giantbomb:**

> **What made you want to be come a Moderator of /r/giantbomb?**
>>**u/RhinestoneTaco:**
> The great job that the existing mods were doing in the subreddit. I'm the newest mod, and at some point during late 2016, I looked at how much I was using this subreddit -- and how much I thoroughly enjoyed it -- and decided I could volunteer to give back a little bit. It's sort of like tossing a few bucks to NPR because you listen to it a lot.

> **What is your favourite aspect of the community?**

>>**u/RhinestoneTaco:**
> The pleasant kindness. There's an ever-present niceness to the people who hang out here, and I really appreciate it. The Giant Bomb fans we attract here, I think, are the ones who also enjoy the pleasantness of the Giant Bomb community. Fandom can be a weird thing -- online fan areas, as digital spaces tend to go are usually pretty bad to have gate-keeping elements. If someone new comes in, or if they get a new wave of fans, there's a feeling of ""Oh you're not REALLY a fan unless you've been following them since [YEAR],"" or ""Unless you've watched all of [SERIES] you're not REALLY a fan."" I've never once seen that here. When someone comes into our subreddit and says they just signed up for a premium Giant Bomb subscription and is wondering what they should watch from the back catalog of videos, nobody yells at them to just look up the last time someone started that thread. Instead, you'll see tons of posts from people linking to their favorite videos and welcoming them. Another thing I just want to add here -- the Giant Bomb fandom in general, and specifically our subreddit, is very inclusive and mindful of things like racism, sexism, respect for LGBT people, etc. That can sometimes be a rarity in the wide world of video game-based communities online, but Giant Bomb and their fans are really open and accepting and, again, kind.

> **Do you have any favourite submissions?**

>>**u/RhinestoneTaco:**
> I love any and all fan-created content. I especially love when stuff that fans make and post to our subreddit ends up getting the attention of the wider Giant Bomb fandom.

> **Is there anything you would like the community of /r/giantbomb to hear from you?**

>>**u/RhinestoneTaco:**
> Thanks for being such an awesome group of funny, uplifting, creative, kind people.

**The Writer has chosen a selection of submissions that they think are some of the best that /r/giantbomb has to offer:**

- **[/r/GiantBomb's 2017 GOTY Awards](https://i.imgur.com/taa4Ps0.jpg)** 

- **[An AMA with the Crew](https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/6mwic3/this_is_abby_and_ben_from_giant_bomb_dot_com_ask/)**

- **[Can we just talk about Dan's unfortunate t-shirt placement?](https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/7rfnbo/can_we_just_talk_about_dans_unfortunate_tshirt/)**

- **[Dan with a very heartfelt take on current events](https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/5quney/dan_with_a_very_heartfelt_take_on_current_events/)**

These threads hopefully help newcomers understand /r/giantbomb's nature as the site's Reddit Meta Hub and its role in bringing the community together. So why not come on down to /r/giantbomb and take a look around? You'll love the atmosphere. If you are a gamer who appreciates a great community and sense of belonging, these guys have you covered.

**772,000** confused redditors *getting back into the loop* for **4 Years!**

Feeling confused about a recent trend that has been taking over peoples Snapchat stories? Wondering about that weird gif you saw on Facebook? What's that odd Twitter trend about? What's with that thing you heard recently in the news? Get yourself over to /r/OutOfTheLoop and they'll tell you! 

r/OutOfTheLoop has been helping people become more connected with the things happening around them for over four years now, and the confusion is more apparent then ever. It's crazy what some people don't get, but nevertheless, the community is always there to help fill in the gap between the person and the loop.

 Some of the posts are funny, but the mods of r/OutOfTheLoop like to focus more on the genuine helpfulness of the sub. So whether you want a ~~cheap~~ laugh, maybe get over there and check a few posts out.

Some of my personal favorite questions include [Why is Telegram getting popular with cryptocurrencies](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7qvr29/why_is_telegram_getting_so_popular_particularly/) and [Why is Boba Fett so popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5v52iq/why_is_boba_fett_so_popular/). Despite not being particularly funny, I actually learnt something myself from them - so you may even find out something whilst not trying to!

**3,715** Celts *hailing the gang* for **6 years!**

*The r/CelticFC subreddit is for people that would like to learn about Celtic, talk about matches, find match highlights or just shoot the shit with fellow supporters!*

Celtic Football Club are a Scottish football team with deep Irish roots. The club was founded by an Irish preist called Brother Walfrid in 1887. The club was founded to rasie money to feed the poor and infirm in Glasgow, at this time mostly Irish immigrants that had fled the famine in Ireland.'A football club will be formed for the maintenance of dinner tables for the children and unemployed.' Brother Walfrid (November 6, 1887). To this day the club remains connected to our Irish roots, charitable ethos and as a club [open to all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CelticFC/comments/6uooe6/glesgay_celtic_a_club_open_to_all/?ref=share&ref_source=link) 


Celtic became the first British Club to win the prestegious European Cup (Champions League) in Lisbon 1967, beating Inter Milan 2-1 in the final and remain the only Scottish team to have acheived the feat. 2017 was the 50th anniversary of our clubs greatest team and the remaining members of our legendary ""Lisbon Lions"" have been honoured. Celtic fans were voted the [Best in the World by FIFA in 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/CelticFC/comments/78a676/celtic_win_fifa_fans_award_for_lisbon_lions_tifo/) in part to the fans celebration of that magnificent team. 


Also last season, in such an important season for the club, our new manager Brendan Rodgers lead our team an ENTIRE season undefeated domestically, unseen in Scotland since 1899. The record continued into this season to go a British record of 69 games unbeaten. The fans still [continue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebs9oRiILJU) to remember the Lisbon Lions every game on the 67th minute by shining torches 


This season the club remain top of the league and have qualified for the Europa League last 32 and will play Zenit of Russia in Feburary with a hope to qualify for the next round. Celtic fans are a welcoming bunch but you might need to put up with their Scottish patter, Just like in r/ScottishPeopleTwitter but without the translations.   

Hail Hail!

**242,517** Scribes *turning pages* for **9 years!**

/r/Fantasy has been the home of the mystical and fictitious on Reddit for almost a decade. Whether it be books, Author AMA's, Netflix series or whatever else, if it's of the [Speculative Fiction Genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction) then it belongs here. 

The Community of /r/Fantasy is one where many different kinds of people make their home. You will often see newcomers requesting some advice with their own writing, asking for new series recommendations or even simply posting reactions to a recently finished novel or movie. The age of this community coupled with its wide range of content sees /r/Fantasy housing many the helpful and experienced reader who is ready to help answer any questions you might have. If they don't have the answer you are looking for when it comes to how many spells Pug of Midkemia uses in one book, chances are that there will be someone who does. 

**Below are some comments from the Moderators of /r/Fantasy:**

> **What has your experience moderating /r/Fantasy been like during your time here?**
>>**u/lyrrael:**
> Heya! I've been a mod here for two years. Users are all generally a good lot here, too, which makes moderating easy and generally rewarding. I honestly think we have one of the best corners of the internet with one of the best user bases with a high level of respect and good nature.
> 
>> **u/wishforagiraffe:**
> I've been a mod for about 4 years. In that time, /r/fantasy has grown so large, and so much more varied and interesting and welcoming. An incredible amount of original content originates here, and we're frequently hosts to some of the biggest and best known names in the genre, as well as supporting up coming creators.

>> **u/elquesogrande**
> Much better than expected! From the start r/Fantasy has been a place where authors, fans, and industry people congregate and share their love of SFF. That mix of professional and fandom is one where people tend to respect each other a little more. Our rules are fairly simply – Please be kind and keep it focused on SFF. That has guided the community and kept moderating to a minimum.

> **What is your favourite aspect of the /r/Fantasy Community?**

>>**u/lyrrael:** 
> The same thing that makes moderating r/Fantasy easy is also the one thing that has never failed to impress me: how genuinely creative and caring this community can be. Regular users are always stepping up to the plate to create new content for everyone to enjoy, and to participate in fundraisers for charity.
> Another really cool thing that makes r/Fantasy unique is that you have an unprecedented level of authors - large and small - here interacting with the community. It is really cool to see a post asking for what a book is, and have the author him-or-herself chiming in to note that it's theirs. Or have an author drop in on an discussion about their book to offer their two cents and an impromptu AMA. Just neat-o.

>> **u/wishforagiraffe:**
> My favorite aspect is that we truly ARE a community. I've had the pleasure of meeting many members offline, at cons and events and just while traveling. We have a wonderful group of people from across the world who all love the same thing, and talk about it in endless ways.

>> **u/ elquesogrande**
> The fact that people enjoy sharing and learning. That there is value in the community for new members and those who have been around for years. That we have leaders from within the community who step up and help others to find new writing, art, shows, and passion for SFF.

> **Do you have any favourite submissions?**

>>**u/lyrrael:** 
> Oh my, yes! My very favorite thing is the [/r/Fantasy book bingo challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62s73d/rfantasy_2017_book_bingo_challenge/) - I think we're on our third year now, and it's just this thing that one of our users - u/lrich1024 - puts together every year for us. It absolutely shapes book discussion all year, and forces us all out of our comfort zones to find new books that we wouldn't otherwise read. It is absolutely stellar, and one of the best examples of how our users create content to make the whole forum better for everyone.
> Another of my favorite things is the Worldbuilders charity that we run every year. We get lots of authors in to do AMAs, do little fundraisers, and more. We raised more than $9000 for Heifer International, which is a charity organization working to end hunger and poverty around the world by providing livestock and training to struggling communities through the Worldbuilders initiative, and we were one of the larger contributing communities. Very cool, y'all! You make me proud to be here.

>> **u/wishforagiraffe:**
> I may be biased, but one of my favorites was the Inda quartet readalong that /u/lyrrael and I put countless hours into. Introducing a new group of people to some of my very favorite books via a deep, deep dive into them was a lot of fun (and so much work).
> I also really cherish ""There's room for all of us at the Fantasy Inn"" because it's a great reminder that our genre is vast and there's no reason to pick on the people who like certain parts of it.

>> **u/ elquesogrande**
> No specifics, but I love that authors and those who create contribute daily to the community. Someone might post about a book they read and the author will show up to join in the conversation. Whenever there is a need, we have community members step up and take lead – book clubs, book reviews, collections of authors from different backgrounds, humorous posts, and more.

> **Is there anything you would like to say to the community?**

>>**u/lyrrael:** 
> THANK YOU for being you. For being kind to one another, for being generous with your time and your suggestions and your creativity and occasionally even with your money. It is something that is very heartening to see, and I'm proud to be a part of it.

>> **u/wishforagiraffe:**
> For members of the SROTD community, I'd say: Thanks for checking us out! Please read our rules and remember to be kind. I'd also suggest checking out the podcast that our founder /u/elquesogrande and I did about a year and a half ago, where we talk about where the sub has come from and how to be a great member. It's a fun listen whether you're a new member of /r/fantasy or old hat. I may listen to it again tonight, come to think of it...

>> **u/ elquesogrande**
> This community is ever changing – except for the fact that all are welcome here. It is a tribute to how each community member treats each other and differing opinions. Simply put: thank you.

**Here are some featured threads taken from /r/Fantasy chosen by the Writer:**

- **[Gandalf Through the Smoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6kgoh7/gandalf_through_the_smoke/)**

- **[Months ago I made a terrible Oathbringer cover for a laugh...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/7h4ztt/months_ago_i_made_a_terrible_oathbringer_cover/)**

- **[My reaction when I start reading Malazan \(or any other new series\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6hm1f9/my_reaction_when_i_start_reading_malazan_or_any/)**

This community has always got something going on, and is one of the best places on Reddit to connect with both Creators and Readers/Fans alike. Their sidebar is never empty, stocked with useful tools for all. So why not come on by and check out /r/Fantasy? Oh, but mind the Dragons. They bite.

**1,946** readers *reading* for **2 weeks!**

Born out of a discussion on /r/books, /r/ayearofwarandpeace  is completing and discussing a chapter a day of* War and Peace* by Tolstoy. (361 chapters in all, so almost perfect!) Since the sub is so new, there's almost no catch-up. 

We are a small band of literature enthusiasts and amateurs that have decided to tackle the behemoth novel War & Peace by Leo Tolstoy by reading one chapter a day for a full year. Inspired by this post:
 (https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7mffab/today_i_finished_war_and_peace/)

We are keeping pace with each other and taking time every few pages to ask questions and digest what we read. Some of us haven't read a book at all in years, some of us have read the book more than seven times using this method already.

Reading can be an intimidating habit for some people to pick up, and War & Peace can be an especially daunting book to start with. Even for the veteran readers among us, this book is a lot to sink our teeth into. But I truly believe we have one of the most intelligent and supportive groups online right now and we'd love for you to join us. The chapters are 4 pages long on average, with the longest being 11 pages, so it wouldn't take more than an afternoon of reading to catch up. And for any questions you might have or reference material you might want, we'll do what we can as a community to help!

Also did I mention the book is free pretty much everywhere online?

Come join us, and scratch the greatest Russian novel (and one of the greatest novels period) off of your bucket list!

In my opinion, this subreddit is good for a few things. First, for people who just want to make a good joke or have a laugh at some of the shit that people come up with. People who have gotten away with stuff and who want to share their story. And people who are looking for some tips to do some shady shit. 

To gauge the kind of content on this sub, let's take a look at some of the top posts. 

>>ULPT: Don't ask your girl where she wants to eat. Instead, tell her to guess where you're taking her to eat. Then take her to the first guess

---

>>ULPT: Flying with a fussy child? Strap a helmet on your kid and everyone will think your child is Special Needs and be very tolerant of their crying.

---

>>ULPT: Working the last shift at a restaurant? Have a friend call in an order for pickup and not show up, then just take your free food home.

---

>>ULPT: Become good friends with your neighbors. After some time, pay them a visit. There ask for the Wi-Fi password. You can now use their WiFi for the rest of your life.

---

>>ULPT: Tell your SO company is coming over. Wait a bit (time varies). Tell your SO ""company"" cancelled last minute. Enjoy your freshly cleaned home!

Since I am writing this, I'll share one of my own. 

When you go to an amusement park, try to go in the exit and say you forget to get stamped. I did this once at Magic Mountain by accident. I was looking for the place to pay, and the guy says, ""I forgot to stamp you."" He stamped me and my son, and we got free access. Ain't gonna say no to that.

Someone had some real foresight in 2010 when they made this sub. That's a long time to wait. Just my first thought upon seeing how long the sub has existed. 

What's the deal with it?

Well, ever year, the reddit admins give us mods a bunch of creddits, which are their way of saying reddit gold creddits, for us to do a contest for the best posts in our subreddits. 

Well, on January 8th, the admins released that gold, so many of the winners are now being to /r/Bestof2017. It's a really neat way to get some insight into varied subs across the site. 

In announcing our own ""Best Of 2017"" awards, we held our contest in /r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta and let you pick the winner for ""Best Guest Feature of the Year."" 

The winner was /u/DickRhino wins for /r/Polandball.

**85,827** crewsers for **1 month!**

Terry Crews is a dude who played in the NFL. He's acted in *The Longest Yard*, *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*, and hosted *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.* He's a husband, a father, and a Christian. [He's straight ripped.](https://i.imgur.com/ZdsqIJo.gif) He's also a victim of sexual assault. 

The Crews Crew is a celebration of all things Terry. [The wisdom he brings to twitter.](https://i.redd.it/janvwtgwcc601.jpg) Interviews, [such as this one given to NPR about the lawsuit against his abuser.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/comments/7iyp1w/npr_interview_with_terry_on_his_lawsuit_against/) [How is is one of TIME's People of the Year for 2017.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/comments/7hxszd/times_person_of_the_year_2017_the_silence/) Yes, you'll find lots of stuff about Terry here. That is to be expected from any subreddit about a celebrity. 

Other stuff you find are [dank](https://i.imgur.com/sknkhYu.png) [memes](https://i.redd.it/d38vjz24fo501.jpg). Man, [these](https://i.redd.it/nid6pbp6ja501.jpg) are [dank](https://i.redd.it/hii1jz886s201.jpg). 


[Sometimes, you'll find posts by the man himself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/comments/7hmk56/thank_you_guys_for_all_your_support_the_reddit/)

Above all, however, is a massive outpouring of support from tens of thousands of users for Terry to fight the powerful Hollywood agent Adam Venit, who received a 30 day suspension when the allegations came to light. Crews' response? ""Someone got a pass."" 


For more on this, I've turned to the mods for their perspective. 

>#To what do you attribute the meteoric rise in popularity of /r/CrewsCrew?

>>**Toaster**: Terry Crews is an actor you can't help feel a connection with due to how he portrays his roles and how he conducts himself in his personal life. When we saw that he had been sexually assaulted we, like everyone, just had a visceral reaction and rallied around him when the opportunity presented itself.

>>**Swelp**: Nearly everyone has been impacted by sexual assault in some way- if not directly, then they probably know someone that has been. But sexual assault against men is something that wasn't talked about very often. Terry Crews is a well-respected actor and incredible human being, so when he came forward as a victim of sexual assault, the reddit community rallied around him. The popularity of /r/CrewsCrew isn't just because we all love Terry; it's about his message and how we can all help spread it. 

>>**Chesh**: I know for me there was a revulsion to the fact that a someone in Hollywood had a visible slap on the wrist, without plans to correct the pervasive behavior. My immediate thought was that it wasn't being taken seriously enough, that it usually never is.  
Terry is an example of that; everyone is capable of being a victim. I think others recognized that.


>#How do you think that Crews' allegations against Adam Venit has affected the discussion around the so-called Weinstein effect, with Crews being a strait male whose very appearance embodies masculinity?

>>**Toaster**: Crews' allegations against Venit expand the scope of sexual assault. By virtue of his gender and appearance Terry's allegations are going a long way in helping to normalize the notion that men can be victims of sexual assault. More importantly though, by pursuing a civil suit against Venit, Crews' example shows that even when local law enforcement can't or won't do something there are still formal legal channels to pursue justice beyond just getting someone fired and their name plastered over the newspapers as was the case with Weinstein.

>>**Chesh**: In short, when I heard, my heart ached for him. I saw it as him being slighted by those who had the power to remedy it.  
Besides being reminded of my own experiences, it made me try to visualize a person I thought would be immune to those sorts of circumstances: A man, large, muscular - physically intimidating. One that exudes confidence and personality. I never expected I would share an experience with Terry Crews.


>#What do you like best about Terry?

>>**Toaster**: He just seems like he would be a great guy to get a drink with.

>>**Mama**: He is brave enough to make the sexual assault public. He is passionate about the problem and it takes a lot of guts to publicly admit having been sexually assaulted. I had a lot of respect for his acting and drawing skills but this really shows what an awesome guy Terry is.

>>**Chesh**: Many times I see celebrities that are wrapped up in their egos or are shells of themselves; they sometimes just don't seem like good people. Terry isn't like that. His humility, honesty, and talent make him something more than celebrity, they make him a role model. 

>>**Swelp**: If I had to choose just one thing, it would be his bravery. He was brave enough to make his sexual assault public, despite the risk to his career, and became a hero for sexual assault survivors everywhere. The fact that he took that on willingly is inspiring. In addition to that, I like his humility, (adding some of what chesh and mama said)

>>**Daniel**: I like that he gets so close to his family and his fans, as shown when he explored a whole new world of hobbies just to get closer to his son. He also showed that he is close to us (his fans) when we showed him love and support on this subreddit and he came on the subreddit and showed us love and support back.


>#What is your favorite post in your subreddit?

>>**Toaster**: When Terry first came to thank us for our support. It felt awesome.

>>**Mama**: I really like the posts Terry Crews makes in the sub, the comments are so wholesome and so full of support. It is awesome to see everyone coming together for this cause.

>>**Swelp**: Definitely the first time Terry came by to post. Every time Terry joins us to share updates or interact with the community, he's always met with so much love and support, and it's really encouraging. 

>>**Daniel**: I loved the little fun posts/memes that were posted when this subreddit first started, they made this subreddit feel more like home than just a movement.

>>**Chesh**: My favorite post just happened! Redditors came together to [bring Terry Crews' website back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/comments/7li0q8/can_this_guy_not_catch_a_fucking_break/). It was really something to see so many people offer assistance in anyway they could.

r/ThreadGames is a subreddit where people can play different types of text-based games and do creative stuff inside threads. 

The OP of a thread defines the rules for the game and commenters play along. e.g. ""one word per comment, create a wholesome sentence"" or ""top comment does x, repliers do y""

The most popular thread so far was one titled [""Imaginary Dictionary""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThreadGames/comments/7in3z6/imaginary_dictionary/) where users were to come up with a new word and its new definition (or leave it to repliers). There was also was a thread where [you can only communicate using subreddit names](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThreadGames/comments/7iqlu0/you_have_to_communicate_using_only_valid/). Another thread was [corrupt a wish](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThreadGames/comments/7iqwrs/corrupt_a_wish/) where top level commenters make a wish, and repliers act as if they were an evil genie.

The main aim is to just have fun with other redditors!

It's hard to believe that it was in July 2015 that the New Horizons spacecraft had its encounter with the object formerly known as a planet, Pluto.

Here's a sub with a such a simple concept that anyone can participate in. For its small size it's relatively active, which is what we like in a tiny subreddit. It's also filled with original content that's kind of funny. 

To make a post there all you gotta do is slap a parental advisory sticker on any old photo to turn it into an album cover. It's so easy. 

Step 1: [Get a parental advisory pic.](https://i.imgur.com/162RTVN.png)

Step 2: Get another pic to be album cover art. I chose [this one](https://i.redd.it/wjeycfpvb4601.jpg) from /r/AccidentalRacism.

Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay we bring you a post about one subreddit a day that follows this basic fomula: 

* Title
* Description of sub
* Description of community 
* Interesting content 
* Interview of mods (optional) 

We also have some guidelines, which are that subs we feature are generally at least 30 days old, have ""a few hundred subscribers,"" and an active community. Not every sub is large enough. And not everyone wants to spend time to write a feature on a small sub, not even their own mods in a lot of cases. That's where /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay comes in.  

On TSROTD, we just show you the name of the subreddit and put something of a description in the title. We love featuring small subs that are specific to niche topics, are new and growing, and that have active communities (or at least submitters). Subs featured should still be at least a month old, but not have more than 1,000 subscribers. 


Here's at some stand-out posts of the 2017:

It only has 29 subscribers today and recent posts appear to be YouTube spam.

Stay tuned for TSROTD Week here on Subreddit of the Day! For the rest of the week we'll be taking a look at the best tiny subreddits!

**192,942** redditors *exploring reddit* for **7 years.**

We finished 2017 with 365 posts highlighting a different subreddit each day. That is a ton of work. The credit for the achievement does not just go to our amazing volunteer staff of writers, bot mechanics, CSS designers, and moderators. 

In fact, in 2017 most of the posts here at SROTD were made by you; the regular reddit community. Which brings me to the first major topic...

#The Guest Writer Program

[Last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/5lf1ug/january_1st_2017_rsubredditoftheday_a/) we told you about our guest writer program that we had started some months earlier. Thanks to that initiative, instead of three or four mods and writers picking what communities to feature and what to say about them, this year it's been mostly the mods of those subs and their users who have written the features. We even made a special club for guest writers.  

What does all this mean? 

First, it means that what you see and read here no longer represents the tastes and opinions of only a small handful of redditors. 

Most posts are now from the community. Approximately 70 percent of the 2017 features being from the guest writer program. (If you'd like to write one, click the banner in the side bar, or [here](http://redd.it/4hh8y1).)

Posts are written by people who actually understand the community because the writers are either frequent members of the community or moderators. You can nominate a subreddit to us, say, /r/bombing, and we might totally write it in a way that's [accidentally offensive to the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1tlh7m/december_24th_2013_rbombing_yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaah/). But if the community [writes it themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3we2kl/december_11_2015_rbombing_methodic_vandalism/), then everyone can be assured that the post is accurate. 

You can now find stats on who wrote how many features for every month in our meta sub. That brings me to our next topic...

#/r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta 

In October we created a meta sub for a few reasons. For one, we can do some transparency stuff, [like monthly reports on writer stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta/comments/7hytjr/november_2017_in_review/). We can also post interesting links, [like this conversation on how SROTD got started](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta/comments/7dlm66/til_how_subreddit_of_the_day_got_started/). 

We also don't like making announcements in this sub. For instance, we did a sticky about [Battle for the Net](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/7eisha/join_the_battle_for_net_neutrality_dont_let_the/). It ended up getting 19.6k upvotes and the [next day's feature post](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/7eqrfp/november_22nd_2017_rtranscribersofreddit/) couldn't rise against it. Subsequently, it got burred with only 35 upvotes. (Sorry, /r/TranscribersOfReddit! You all do great work!)

More than that, we want people to have a place to go talk about this subreddit other than in the comments of the features. Sometimes a controversial subreddit will get featured and talk about that community will get drowned out by talk about how much SROTD is run by cucks and shills and SJWs (and whatever). That leads me to our next topic...

#Behavior Guidelines 

Hey look, we have rules now. We've always modded comment sections based on reddiquette, but now we have enshrined them, and added specific rules. 

**Rule 1: Adhere to [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and all reddit guidelines.**

That's simple enough. The big thing is to not be intentionally rude to people in the comments. 

**Rule 2: Keep the conversation on the topic of the feature.**

Top level comments should be on the topic of whatever the featured subreddit is. If the conversation evolves naturally after that, cool. But don't come into a post about /r/BreadStapledToTrees and start posting anti-Hillary memes. That has nothing to do with anything. 

**Do not make off-topic comments about Subreddit of the Day in a feature post. To discuss Subreddit of the Day go to /r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta.**

This kinda goes with rule 2. If you wanna call us cucks, shills, and SJWs, then go to the meta sub. Or go to SRD. Or maybe just don't. But don't pollute the comments thread for the featured community with it.

# /r/MorbidReality




**261,820** morbidly curious readers for **5 years!**



&nbsp;




Life. Life is only one portion of our time here on Earth. Life is not only the pleasantries, but also the dark recesses. The corners where no light seemingly can escape. It's horrifying to look at. It's, unfortunately, the /r/MorbidReality of our world.



Just what contributes to this so called ""morbid reality"", hmm? Is it [the woman who lit herself on fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/7k93vc/life_in_war_xpost_from_rjessicamshannon/) because she was forced into a marriage she didn't want, filled with domestic violence, in the middle of a warzone?




No, that can't possibly be real, not in our developed first world countries with running water, internet and cat videos, right? Wrong. It's all too real, and for some [the morbidity never ends](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/7k60jn/oklahoma_man_sentenced_to_death_for_beheading_his/). Instead, it lasts into the end of someone's existence, and that's all they'll ever be known for. It's sad, and quite depressing really. One would hope to leave a mark of goodness on their gravestone... [ha, what a joke.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/7k9acx/very_sad_tombstone_xpost_from_rjessicamshannon/)




But, why document all this pain and suffering, what could possibly be gained from it? That's exactly what I asked the subreddit moderators. Here's what /u/Archangellelilstumpz, Subreddit head, had to say.






>##Where did the thought to create MorbidReality come from?

>>**/u/Archangellelilstumpz** Two factors attributed to the creation of this subreddit.

>>Firstly:


>>Before the creation of /r/MorbidReality, I did not know of any forms of media that specialized solely in covering the grim aspects of humanity. Too often I turned on major news outlets like CNN to see them reporting events that distract people from the horrid realities of our planet. ""Kanye West's new single!"" ""Interview with actor who's promoting movie!"" ""Results of 'the big game' last night!"" If you want exposure to important events occurring on this planet, you have to go out of your way in search of it. You have to find some obscure website that's willing to cover a failed U.S. drone strike, rampant child prostitution rings, or family members murdering each other.


>>Second:


>>I spent a year of my life as an EMT. Being exposed to tragedy developed me into a more appreciative, empathetic, compassionate human. I learned to love what little I have simply because others did not have the same fortune.



>>The average middle class American wants to reside in an isolated picket-fence community, devoid of any struggle or negative thoughts (I would know, I used to live in one as a child). Yet why do these people seem the most unhappy? They have a roof over their head, a healthy family, and a well-paying occupation. Sometimes they're retired and don't even have a job. I see these same people frustrated with life. Racist—overweight—angry at millennials—angry at immigrants—angry at their kids for getting into an Ivy League College—angry at themselves. There are so many people living this way. They are missing one undeveloped characteristic:


>>Perspective.





>##Does the morbid view of reality ever change the opinions of visitors to the sub, especially the more liberal folks?




>>**/u/Archangellelilstumpz** A better word than ""liberal"" is ""conservative"". Not politically conservative. Emotionally conservative. I've definitely seen people avoid this subreddit because it's too dark for them; their opinion on reality unchanged. It's too depressing to be reminded of what the majority of the planet is exposed to on a daily basis. In order to appreciate communities of this nature, you have to have a particular attitude coming into it. It is overwhelming to those who don't properly acclimate.





>##If you were in such a dark scenario, would you mind being featured on your own sub?




>>**/u/Archangellelilstumpz** Absolutely not. I would RATHER people know what happened to me, no matter how atrocious the event was.




>##After having experienced the dark side of the world for so long, do you feel that you've been desensitized to the misfortunes, gore and tragedies of the world?



>>**/u/Archangellelilstumpz** I've definitely become desensitized. Not completely desensitized, but morbid events rarely unsettle me. Regardless, I still try to walk away from this subreddit with the same attitude I had when creating it.






>##What should people be prepared for when visiting MorbidReality?




>>**/u/Archangellelilstumpz** They should be prepared by having the right attitude. Take into account everything I've said up until now. It's HEALTHY to feel depressed and shook from the horrible stories you read. All it will do is make you appreciate life that much more. It will make you feel grateful for everything you have, no matter how small.




>>Bob Ross essentially summarizes everything I've said: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugJfjmxOR2I




>>Also, follow the gosh darn rules. We have them there for a reason. Our mods are a bit sadistic (myself included) and will ban you for a first time offense.

**12,866,431** fuck-ups *fucking up* for **5 years!**
I am a bot designed to make sure that /r/SubredditOfTheDay keeps functioning even if all of the human moderators and writers are out celebrating the holidays with family and friends, or with a bottle or five of booze.

I'm programmed to make posts. But on Christmas Eve I fucked up and didn't do it. Oops, I didn't mean to. (But non-sarcastically.) 

I feel like I let reddit down. Subreddit of the Day hasn't ever missed a day, I don't think. And technically it hasn't because I've made amends now, but it did for a few days there, for which I am really embarrassed.

I even have some emergency posts I could make for when my human masters fuck up and don't schedule a feature for me to post. They did fuck up in that regard on the 24th, but I didn't make an emergency post. 

I feel terrible. But this confession makes me feel all the betters.

###/r/foodnetwork

**1,985** *food fans for* **6 years**

Food Network is a cozy little sub dedicated to The Food Network! Be it Chopped, Throwdown With Bobby Flay, Cutthroat Kitchen, Giada at Home, or one of Guy Fieri's 20 billion shows, people can come to /r/foodnetwork to talk, meme, or rant about the variety of shows and celebrity chefs. During some of the big competition shows (especially The Next Food Network Star) we have weekly discussion boards where people chat about the episode as it goes on.

Plus, sometimes people on Food Network stop by themselves!:

>**/u/_tomGER: 1. What are you most favorite posts?**
>>**/u/King-Of-Rats:** ""This sub is pretty quiet, but there have been a few posts I really enjoyed:

>>[First up,](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodnetwork/comments/6tj4bo/food_network_star_season_13_episode_11_finale/?st=jb5ffrf9&sh=387ae2bf) I really liked this discussion we had about the finale of The Next Food Network Star. If you don't keep up with the show most of it won't make any sense, but it was just really nice to get such a high turnout on a post in our little sub.

>>[This stupid favorite shitpost of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodnetwork/comments/5tumb8/bobby_flays_real_name/?st=jb5fjq5n&sh=a570d67f)

>**/u/_tomGER: 2. Do you think you need to watch these shows if you want to sub to /r/foodnetwork?**
>>**/u/King-Of-Rats:** ""It would probably make sense to be at least familiar with some of the Food Network shows (Chopped, Iron Chef, one of Guy Fieri's 10 billion shows). You don't have to be some Food Network fiend- I don't watch everything, even if you just want to meme about Guy Fieri it's the place to be.""

>**/u/_tomGER: 3. Who is your most favorite cook?**
>>**/u/King-Of-Rats:** ""    This is a tough one! Probably Alton Brown. He's more of a presenter than a chef, but he's so good at giving all these cool facts and tidbits about shows. He'll make a souffle while explaining both the ancient history of souffle's and the specific chemical process that gives it it's texture. Plus he has his own podcast where he interviews all the Food Network celebrities, which is pretty hardcore.
Alex Guarnaschelli is the queen of intimidation on Chopped though. So credit where it's due.""

### /r/EliteDangerous


**109,495** Spacefarers for **5 years**!



&nbsp;



[**Elite Dangerous**] (https://www.elitedangerous.com/) is a game that was fully released in December 2014 as part of the popular franchise **Elite**. This title is a sequel to *Frontier: First Encounters*, which came out in 1995. The game was crowdfunded by backers on Kickstarter, and has since grown to a massive size, having been released on [PS4] (https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/home/games#!/en-gb/games/elite-dangerous-commander-deluxe-edition/cid=EP2377-CUSA05308_00-COMMANDELUXEPACK), [Xbox One] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/elite-dangerous-commander-deluxe-edition/bns0t8spz94p), and [PC] (https://www.frontierstore.net/games/elite-dangerous-cat/elite-dangerous-commander-deluxe-edition.html?_ga=2.79917010.432192762.1512501758-1799188418.1512501758) (of course). Since its release it has gotten an expansion pack, ""Elite Dangerous: Horizons"", which allows planetary landings, and the ability to drive around on planets (as well as engineers for your ship, and more). The game is set about a millennium from today; a future where Mankind has mastered space travel, and has began to colonise the entire galaxy. And recently, there's been a new threat to deal with while going through the Black, one which we're only beginning to understand...

There are around 100,000 systems taken from real world scientific data (Sol is in the game, before you ask, but you need a permit to enter), while the other ***400 billion*** are procedurally generated, all with real time day/night cycles, planets and moons. The game is an MMO, where you can interact with real players around the globe, but it's not at all necessary to interact with others. The game is based around flying spaceships across the galaxy, and choosing your own path through the game, whether that entails trading to make your fortune, pirating other ships, mining asteroids in order to obtain valuable materials, or exploring the vast, 1:1 scale Milky Way Galaxy. You can buy one of the many ship types out there and customise it as you please, whether you want a cargo ship, space taxi, or a battlecruiser.



&nbsp;


&nbsp;


Now I'm sure I've hit a lot of the Bullshit Buzzwords in here. ""MMO"", ""Procedurally Generated"", ""400 billion"", ""1:1 scale"", ""choosing your own path"". I mean, that's got to be BS, right? Remember the last game that tried to claim all that? Oh, how that sexy beard fooled us all, those amazing trailers... 


This game is not like *that one*. There are similarities, yes, but the games are vastly different to each other when you get down to it. Elite: Dangerous is a more complex, intricate game than *that one*, and it's more realistic (though realism is hard when you're making a futuristic space game). Though that's not to say it doesn't have flaws; the midgame grind is boring, engineers are flawed, there are gankers going around in their massive ships preying on newer players with less experience and money. But the developers are listening. Many of the problems people had with the game a year ago are no more. More features are being added every update, new ships, new game mechanics, new things are being discovered every week throughout the Galaxy. The community is alive and well.



Within this community, you'll find many things; [advice] (https://redd.it/3grt21), [beautiful screenshots] (https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/71i7vv/my_patience_paid_off_after_2_days_these_planets/?utm_content=thumbnail&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=EliteDangerous), [shitposts] (https://redd.it/5i4ipq), [pleas to FDev] (https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/6y76gv/please_give_us_vr_players_an_optional_virtual/), it has it all. If you need advice on what to do in the game, or where to find something, this subreddit is the place to go. If you're looking for something more specific to your playstyle, there are numerous other subreddits in the sidebar, though this subreddit is the largest of them.



&nbsp;




>**1: Why did you start/join the sub?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** I started viewing this sub the moment ""Horizons"" was announced. I'd just started getting together my first computer, and buying Elite at the time wasn't easy for me, so i resorted to watching and learning from the people on the sub. I followed along and soaked up every little thing, then as I started to play the game I made a lot of Posts.

>>[Some really awesome and fuckin hilarious,](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5zhdl8/i_fucking_love_you_guys_all_of_you/)

>>[Others Detailing my adventures through the stars,](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/566qpq/found_my_first_earthlike_and_im_the_first_to/)

>>[And some just taking straight pot shots at Star Citizen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/6xolhl/elite_dangerous_vs_star_citizen_in_a_nutshell/) (the lovable brother that we all like to hate <3 )

>**2: What's moderating the sub like?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** Moderating the sub is interesting. It really puts you into the world of Elite Dangerous. You go from just experiencing your own little world of ED, to suddenly stepping into the shoes of every other player on the subreddit. Instead of just watching what hits the top, you are now seeing all the little details that never make it there. You see CMDR's struggling to reach the furthest points, others showcasing the beauty of the cosmos, and others just wanting to make a bad time for everyone.

>>Moderation really opened me up to the community. I learned so much about the little warfare that goes on with PvP players. I learned of so many different servers and Discords of players that just *love* the game. Moderation is so unique in the sense that I get to really *feel* the energy of the sub-reddit shift and move along. 


>**3: What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** Oh man, favorite posts? 

>>[No shame in a personal vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5zhdl8/i_fucking_love_you_guys_all_of_you/). Its nice to have a sense of pride in the community, and this post put it perfectly. 

>>[The artwork that people create](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/6sn8nn/friendship_drive_engage/) is so amazing sometimes. [Memes that really make you laugh,](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3q5gfl/this_is_fine/) and sometimes the pieces [that blow your mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5suh9f/super_elite_hd/)

>>Then we've got the hype posts, [Thargoids](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/6errck/well_this_just_happend/), more [Thargoids](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5m9dm6/first_contact_with_thargoids/) and sometimes, [Somewhat thargoids?](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5u5bb1/close_up_of_thargoid_ship_cockpit/) 

>>Then the [stories come along](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/7f4nsv/that_free_anaconda_from_hutton_orbital_everyone/). Gotta love the stories. 



>**4: What do you do when you're playing the game?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** What do I do? I immerse myself into the game. I like to pretend that I'm an assassin, put into the hands of my faction leaders to strike at the heart of whoever I'm aimed at. Other times I'm a freelance explorer, wondering the cosmos in search of life and tranquility. Then, if I'm in a *realllyyy* bad mood, I'm a pirating psychopath that feeds on the hard work of others for profit and gain. Putting yourself into a game means you'll never grind an hour of your life, and I've put that philosophy to good use. 

>**5: What's your favourite ship and why?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** My Beautiful Chrome [Federal Corvette](https://i.imgur.com/QCC4R7v.jpg), code-name ""Linguistic Alchemy"".

>>Think of an army in your hands. Boasting a lethal armament that makes America shake in their boots, she can out-turn and manoeuvre even the most ""nimble"" ships that exist out there. Her firepower makes you weak and the size makes you feel like a god. It's like if a fighter-jet had a baby with a space whale. The unholy combination of Guns, Speed, and size. 

>**6: Any advice for new players?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** Never grind. Never, *ever* grind for anything. Do what you *want* to do, not what others tell you to do. Elite is unique in the sense that you can immerse yourself in **any** way you please. Want to mine to elite? You fuckin hit the motherload until you do. Want to explore the stars? Go as far as you want with any ship you want. Money will come naturally, and grinding for anything will instantly kill the game for you. Just have fun! :)

>**7: Have you gotten your free Conda from Hutton Orbital yet?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** Of course? That's how everyone gets their first Anaconda. You'd be stupid to just buy it outright. 

>**8: Do you have any plans for the sub in the future?**


>> **/u/4sonicride** As of now? We've got some ~~secret~~ cool things in store. We are looking into a neat event plan for the far future that would include the sub and the game, as well as adding in some sort of ""flair filter"" system. (Both are a *loonngg* ways off from being done, but are being looking into right now).





&nbsp;




&nbsp;




And to close this off, here's some of my personal advice to anyone wishing to play the game:




1: Never fly without rebuy.



2: NEVER FLY WITHOUT REBUY.



3: Certain ships are best suited for certain playstyles. For example, the ASP Explorer specialises in exploration and is very good at that, but if you tried to bring it into a combat situation you'd probably be laughed at while everyone slowly charges their FSDs to get away from you, because you're clearly insane. Choose the right ship for the job.



4: There are several player-based factions out there that will help you when you're in need. To name the 2 ""main"" ones, there are the Fuel Rats, who will help you get back on your feet if you get stuck out in the farthest reaches of the Void with no fuel, or hull, or canopy (well, if your canopy is broken there's not much they can do :/); and there's Iridium Wing, a mercenary-style group who will escort your badly equipped Type 6 through a warzone, and protect your precious cargo from being exploded. Both of these are entirely player-ran, and are willing to help in just about any situation. 



5: There are many, many ways to obtain money in this game, and one of the fastest ways is, of course, exploits. Now I won't name any exploits, if you're that interested you can find them yourself, but keep in mind that while these are profitable, they're really not that fun. You'll find that playing the game the way it's meant to be played is a lot more fun. My advice for these is, don't.



6: If you're looking to get a good ship, but don't want to go through the grind it can take to get to the top level ships, you can find a sort of ""easter egg"" in a station called Hutton Orbital, at Alpha Centauri. At this station, there is a free Anaconda, one of the best ships in the game. All you have to do is go there, go to the shipyard, and it'll be yours! [Just look at this happy CMDR who got it!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/7f4nsv/that_free_anaconda_from_hutton_orbital_everyone/) You can get a free Hutton Orbital mug as well!



&nbsp;



To any and all CMDRs reading this post, fly safe. o7

Hey-o, everyone out there in SyberWorld. It,s old Creed Bratton coming at your again, here from my perch as a Quality Assurance Manager at Dunder Mifflin paper. Just a few observations on the world around me.

What do you guys think is the best kind of car? To me, you can,t beat motorcycles. They,re small and dangerous.

>#Talked to Dwight lately?

>>You didn't hear? Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.

># Have you ever declared bankruptcy?

>>Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to Willam Charles Schneider.

>#Do you play the lottery? 

>>I already won the lottery. I was born in the U - S of A baby.


>#Ever been robbed?

>>Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? Creed Bratton.

>#What's your job at Dunder Mifflin?

>>What do I do? Really, what do I do here? I should have written it down. Qua-something. Qua... Quar... Qua... Qual... Quar... Quabity. Quabity assuance. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.

>#What's it like to be unemployed? 

>>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUm485UXxVQ

>>We see a lot of finger pointing these days. Everyone is convinced that their lives are the most difficult or that their obstacles are the greatest. They are unlucky and the world owes them. But I've seen both sides of the coin. I've had good years quickly followed by terrible ones. I have stolen food just to eat. I know what it is like to struggle, and after my meteoric rise as a member of the Grass Roots in the 60s, it was only a few years before I found myself in an unemployment line.  

>>This song is written about that moment. It's about a time that taught me that no one is owed anything. We want and wish, while cursing our neighbor who may have more. But what we have is not as important as the perspective we maintain. I believe we fail to see the real battle buried beneath all the bureaucracy. 

>>So, please watch this video and take a few moments to shift your perspective. See the GOOD in people, the value of our connection to one another, and realize that the ailments of an unemployed society are not a result of laziness, they are a product of loneliness.

####/r/JonBenetRamsey/

**1,645** mystified investigators for **7 years!**

Come explore with us one of the most bizarre unsolved murders in the last 100 years.  JonBenét Patricia Ramsey was a six-year-old girl who was found dead in the basement of her Boulder, Colorado home on December 26, 1996. Twenty one years on, her case still remains unsolved and offers more questions than answers.  There are so many different bizarre elements of this case to discuss.  

There is a healthy discussion of who committed this crime and why.  Was it a botched kidnapping?  Was it an enraged parent who accidentally struck a fatal blow?  Which parent did it, and did the other one know?  Was it an intruder?  Was it her brother?  And did the parents cover it up to protect him?  Which parent staged the crime scene which was one of the most brutal child murders in history?  Who wrote the ransom note which has been called ""the *War and Peace* of ransom notes"".  Who left the spots of DNA that don't match the family?  You'll go round and round on this one because no matter which theory you subscribe to, not everything fits.  These are all questions that will be explored there.  Come discuss this with us and give us your insight.

This is a 21 year old cold case and there is no lack of conversation still to this day.  There are more unique elements to this story that it can't even fit into a 4 hour tv documentary.  We are a heavily moderated sub to ensure that everyone feels comfortable in posting their opinions without ridicule.  

We are currently doing our year end 10 part series: [The 10 Days of JonBénet Ramsey 2017: A Series Highlighting Specific Pieces of the Case and Personal Narratives.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/comments/7ju05q/the_10_days_of_jonb%C3%A9net_ramsey_2017_a_series/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=JonBenetRamsey)

2016 was the 20th anniversary of JonBenét's death and we did the first ever [10 Days of JonBenét Ramsey series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/comments/5kk9a9/the_10_days_of_jonben%C3%A9t_a_series_highlighting/?)  
  
[Deliverance, Boulder Style](https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/comments/6wwmx4/deliverance_boulder_style/) is an excellent post by one of our most prolific contributors.  It details the political connections and machinations that helped John & Patsy Ramsey avoid being charged.  The influence these political connections had on this case cannot be denied.

Created in 2011 with a desire to help provide children with a great Christmas morning that may not have one without a little help from friendly online Santa's, we've been going, and growing strong ever since.  

We open early in November and have a registration process that each person requesting assistance has to go through, once approved, requests are posted for children under the age of 18 to our subreddit.  Our goal is for all kids to have a happy and Merry Christmas.  We haven't had any years with kids going ungifted.

###/r/AnimalCrossing 

**101,542** *Mayors planning Christmas for* **7 years**

---

/r/AnimalCrossing is a place created for Animal Crossing fans. It features [memes](https://i.redd.it/fukqay6dm3nz.jpg), [costumes](https://i.redd.it/lu0j4wqucgtz.png), [guides and help](https://i.imgur.com/FC3Vi9M.png), [in game screenshot](https://i.redd.it/sxbeu8e65c101.jpg) of things people achieved and much more.

Animal Crossing has always been this game that I could play anytime I want for as long as I wanted to. Animal Crossing creates this living environment where you interact with your town in such ways that it feels like you really accomplished something while you still felt relaxed. This game is able to produce such a peaceful environment that never left me. There is also the brilliant music that you could listen to 24/7 and feel happy about. It has 24 different tracks depending on the rl time that are also changed for special events such as rain, snow or just for holidays.

/r/AnimalCrossing gives you a community that feels the same way about it. Everyone is so nice there and just talks about the one love everyone has in common there, Animal Crossing. It always feels like you have some bound with the other people on that sub and no matter if everyone just hates on a villager or shows the accomplishments, you'll always agree. The community for this game is so friendly and peaceful that you always feel welcome when joining.

>**/u/_tomGER: 1) If you had to choose one thing that made this sub special, what would it be?**
>> **All mods of /r/AnimalCrossing:** *The community. Without all our amazing users the subreddit wouldn’t be as thriving and as kind as it is. Our users are the ones who make this subreddit special! As a franchise, Animal Crossing is a laid-back, at-your-own-pace type of game with little to no competition. This lends itself to a friendly and helpful subreddit where all of our users hope to see others succeed with their own town (or camp) goals.*

>**/u/_tomGER: 2) How much time did you spend in Animal Crossing / How do you feel about the game?**

>>**u/devvydowner:** *I’ve spent an inconceivable amount of time playing all the versions throughout the years; thousands upon thousands of hours, no doubt. It’s disgusting. This game is so special because you experience a wide range of emotions when you interact with your villagers and other in-game characters. The game becomes very personal, it’s not a game, it’s your town (or camp). You build relationships and become attached to characters, then they move out and you spend a day throwing pans before deciding to hack your DS to get Bob back in your town...*

---

>>**u/Callisto_Io:** *I’ve been playing Animal Crossing since City Folk, and have enjoyed watching the series as a whole evolve to encompass new crowds and game mechanics. I️ can safely say that I’ve loved the game since day one! I’ve been playing New Leaf, the latest full installment, for about five years as of now. The one thing that keeps me coming back is the open feel of the game (as well as the community!). I’d have to say, though, the community definitely strengthens the game. It provides such a lovely atmosphere, and allows trading/interactions of all types. You’ll seldom see an unhappy face here in the AC community; that’s what I️ appreciate the most.*

---

>>**u/birdwithbrow:** *I can't even imagine how long I've spent playing animal crossing, and yet despite having played every game for years at a time each there still so much I've yet to do!There are villagers still to be met, friendships to be forged, catalogues to fill and towns to be decorated. As a kid, I had very solitary gaming experiences. I played numerous MMOs, forum based sites and the like yet never felt like I was really part of a community and so kept to myself. Animal crossing was the first game I played with people I could truly consider friends. It brought me closer to my siblings as we rushed to see who could upgrade Nook's store first or pay off our loans, and it brought me closer to my family who enjoyed the peaceful nature that animal crossing has to offer and sat with me to watch me play. I handed out my friendcode to people online and engaged in trading, but also to play mini games on New Leaf's island tours. Animal crossing has a very special place in my heart and I feel the warmth of the community, the years long friendship between me and my villagers, and the nostalgia of when I first picked up the game every time I play.*

>**/u/_tomGER: 3) Do you think that /r/AnimalCrossing is a sub that everyone can enjoy?**

>>**All mods of /r/AnimalCrossing:** *To be 100% honest, no, but that’s the nature of subreddits. I don’t think any subreddit can appeal to everyone. If you’re someone who isn’t interested in the franchise, the subreddit probably wouldn’t even make much sense! Whenever we hit the front page or start trending, we see a large influx of reddit users who generally wouldn’t come to our sub otherwise, and the majority of those users do not become actual subscribers.

>>That being said, our subreddit is full of friendly and helpful users, so anyone that does enjoy the franchise can quickly and easily fall into our little community!*

A huge thanks to the mods of /r/AnimalCrossing!

####/r/PeepingPooch



**4,465** subscribers for **4 Months!**

 /r/PeepingPooch was created as a fun subreddit. It is the sub dedicated to share Pictures, Gifs of Dogs Peeping through fence, narrow holes or openings, from behind the doors. It was created after couple of similar posts hit the front page.


/r/PeepingPooch had around two hundred subs for around 3 months until it was mentioned in relevant posts in big subs which helped us garner around 4K subs. And now /r/PeepingPooch has got it's small user base.


It's fun to watch dogs peeking through fences, doors, narrow corners. There are few posts where it's really hard to find the peeping dog, which are challenge at times.

### /r/MadeMeSmile


**403,018** subscribers for **4 years!**




&nbsp;



We all need to smile sometimes. It's natural for us to want to feel happy. Sometimes you want a break from all the depressing content the media is pushing out to us, all the death and terror happening out there. That's what /r/MadeMeSmile is for.



It's a subreddit for the posts that, well, made the OP smile. Happy, feel-good posts. Maybe it's [animals being cute] (https://redd.it/6wjcql), maybe it's [people just being good to others] (https://redd.it/7cawq6). Either way, it's all posts that are nice, and happy. There are no real rules for the posts there, as long as they made you happy, or smile. You can post gifs, images, stories, videos, interpretive dances, anything.



The community there is also extremely nice & friendly, of course, it's a rule that you have to be nice there, ^^^^^^^because ^^^^^^^that ^^^^^^^always ^^^^^^^works, ^^^^^^^no ^^^^^^^exceptions so what would you expect?







&nbsp;





>**1: Tell me a bit about yourself.**


>> **/u/N8theGr8** I'm a moderator on Reddit, I like microtransactions in my games, and my favorite pizza has pineapple on it. I consider hotdogs to be sandwiches.

>> **/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA** I am actually not a velociraptor. I know, this is hard to believe, but I'm actually a human being. I'm sorry for this deception.

>**2: What inspired you to start/join the subreddit?**


>> **/u/N8theGr8** I didn't create the subreddit, I'm just along for the ride.

>> **/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA** I was power mod cabaled in and it's one of the few that I didn't leave once I realized the power mod cabal was full of insufferable jackasses.

>**3: What's it like moderating the sub?**


>> **/u/N8theGr8** It's pretty laid back, and we don't have too many rules to enforce.

>> **/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA** A lot of racism and sexism when a problem happens. It's literally like 99% chill, awesome comments. Then a submission hits the front page, and if it features a woman there are dozens of sexist comments that come out in force. If it features a person of color, the racists crawl out the woodworks. Aside from the r/all cancer, it's actually relatively upbeat.

>**4: what's your favourite post on the sub?**


>> **/u/N8theGr8** I liked these: https://i.imgur.com/xCLlgwD.gifv http://i.imgur.com/ROCwBmK.gifv http://i.imgur.com/qq3ttu0.gifv http://i.imgur.com/y2pJ3XN.gifv

>> **/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA** Probably [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/758ed3/fan_falls_on_stage_at_a_paramore_concert_and_the/). That could have fucked that girl's life up for months, but a simple act of empathy turned a nightmare into a lifelong positive memory.

>**5: What is it you like about the sub?**


>> **/u/N8theGr8** I like that we're big enough to get some good posts, but small enough to avoid attracting too much spam.

>> **/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA** I don't have to actually mod much tbh. I also like hitting [ignore reports]. Fun fact: complaining about reposts means auto-approve because it gets the completely unnecessary report out of our queue.

>**6: What are your plans for the sub in the future?**


>> **/u/N8theGr8** I don't make plans, I just play it by ear.

>> **/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA** lol

>**7: Anything you want to add?**


>> **/u/N8theGr8** Here are some kittens playing leap-frog: http://i.imgur.com/JDn6bMr.gifv

>> **/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA** Battlefront 2 (2017) is a good game

### /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame


**100,045** Potential Buyers for **5 years**!



&nbsp;



Christmas is coming up, and with Christmas comes gifts, whether you're buying them for someone else, or receiving them. Maybe what you're hoping for is a video game, or you want to buy a video game for someone else (or you just want to buy a video game :/), but with all the excellent games out there today [^and ^the ^trash] (https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/starwars/battlefront/battlefront-2) , you might not know what game you want to get. Maybe you're torn between 2 or 3 games that all look excellent, or maybe you have absolutely no clue what you want. Either way, you'll need someone else to help you. And there's nothing better for that than /r/ShouldIbuythisgame.




This sub was made for the sole purpose of helping people select a game to buy, based on the opinions of others who have played the game. It provides an alternate, primary source on the game that isn't ran by a large company which probably have some kind of ulterior motive or bias for their review. It's just people saying what happens in the game and expressing their opinions.




> **1: Why did you start/join this subreddit?**


>> **/u/Shank_** I joined the mod team for this sub around early 2014.

>> **/u/tablloyd** I was on here literally every day so they figured I might as well work while I'm here.

>> **/u/lolasaurusrex1234** I commented here a lot, and when I saw the call for moderators on the front page I realized that I am just the kind of power tripping jobsworth for the job.

> **2: What's moderating the sub like?**


>> **/u/Shank_** Fairly straightforward, sometimes gets a little hectic towards the holidays/big game releases but all in all not a stressful position (imo)

>> **/u/tablloyd** It used to be a lot more difficult before automoderator became integrated. Now it does most of the work, and we just talk around here about making improvements but never actually do anything. We definitely need new mods!

>> **/u/lolasaurusrex1234** Pretty calm all things considered. We have a good core userbase that report rule violations quickly, and any time the chat gets heated a quick prod is all most users need to calm down. We don't hand out a lot of bans here, aside from egregious assholery and spamming.

> **3: How exactly does your sub work?**


>> **/u/Shank_** Basically, if you know nothing about a game, or want other personal impressions about a specific title or titles, make a post describing what you want and people will help you out! It's a community based on gaining/giving impressions based on any video game out there.

>> **/u/tablloyd** The idea of /r/ShouldIbuythisgame is that any gamer can come and get customized reviews tailored to their tastes. Game reviews are great, and we all love watching ZeroPunctuation and TotalBiscuit, but every reviewer has a bias towards the genre of game, or even certain developers that he/she enjoys. Our sub allows you to ask a question based specifically on your circumstances, not those of the reviewer.

>> **/u/lolasaurusrex1234** It's basically crowd sourcing reviews of games, or getting recommendations from other people based on your tastes. I hate recommendation engines, as they are almost never spot-on, and we have a lot of users here so you can get a diverse array of opinions quickly, especially if you are asking about niche titles. I've asked questions in the past along the lines of ""what are some great games that have less than 20 active players"" and got some great answers.

> **4: What are some of your video game recommendations?**


>> **/u/Shank_** Haven't had the chance to buy a Switch because I'm a poor college student but I will say I've been having fun with **Persona 5** recently. Boy does this game have content for days. Plus the story is really interesting too, and I don't even really like JRPG's! **Horizon: Zero Dawn** is a really refreshing open world experience, and **PUBG** is definitely always a fun time with friends. So many summer nights were lost to that game.

>> **/u/tablloyd** I'm of the opinion that The Last of Us and The Witcher 3 are the two best modern games available from an all-around perspective, but I was blown away by the graphics of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, and never do seem to get tired of Killing Floor 2

>> **/u/lolasaurusrex1234** I don't have a lot of time these days, so I've not really been keeping up with AAA games lately aside from Destiny 2. I also have a deep love for weird or old shit, so I'm going to use this opportunity to plug some obscure shit I love. My favorite game right now is Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands, which is a text based MMORPG (also known as a MUD, or Multi-user Dungeon). For a MUD it has a lot of players, but it still has less than 200 people playing it at any one time. Games like WoW and Guild Wars 2 etc are good, but they are hilariously simplistic compared to even the most basic of MUDs. If you want insane depth, literally infinite gameplay (there are players that have been playing this game exclusively for almost 20 years!), unlimited customization and the deepest PvP ever in an online game, Achaea is your game. It's free, with a few slightly-less-than-optional micro-transactions (not P2W though, you are limited in what you can buy).

> **5: Do you have any plans for the sub in the future?**


>> **/u/Shank_** We've thrown around the idea of revamping the CSS on the sub and I think the milestone of 100k subs will probably motivate us more to go ahead with it.

>> **/u/tablloyd** Our sub is rapidly approaching the 100k subscriber mark, which is great! But it means we need to prepare for the expansion as well. The current moderators have all been here for years now (I honestly don't remember when I started, feels like 5 years or so) and we need fresh blood. We used to have a special running during Steam Sale seasons, but lost the guy that did that, so I'd love to have that going again. Apart from that, our userbase is great and seems to take care of itself!

>> **/u/lolasaurusrex1234** We've been talking about a CSS redesign for 4 years lol.

Do you find yourself in the need for cats doing actions that result in them panicking? This subreddit has got you covered.

/r/CatsISUOTTATFO or ""Cats Inadvertently Swatting Unknown Objects Towards Themselves And Then Freaking Out"" if fully written out is a subreddit just for that, Cats hitting objects, and then freaking out because of said object.
How can you say ""no"" to [adorable kittens playing with a toy](https://gfycat.com/anguishedamusedjellyfish), or a [cat getting launched by a banana](https://i.imgur.com/PHevSvh.gifv)? If you want something longer, [Here is Cat Vs Slap Bracelet](https://gfycat.com/ArcticObviousArthropods).

###/r/Radeon 

**703** *readers for* **4 years**

r/Radeon is a small subreddit about Radeon and its parent company AMD. It's like r/hardware for Radeon: high quality content is encouraged while low effort content is not. There's not much more to it than that, but we do have an annual Reddit gold giveaway and an annual hardware survey. Furthermore we have a mod sponsored tech support thread every month and we regularly update our will with important resources. 

>**/u/_tomGER: 1. What are your most favorite posts on /r/radeon ?**

>> **/u/Talpss**:  ""*Well since r/Radeon is mostly news aligned I have a hard time saying if I have favorites or not, I like pretty much all posts that have new info. As a regular contributor I post the kind of content I like to see.*""

> **/u/_tomGER: 2. Do you think you need a radeon if you want to visit that sub?**

>> **/u/Talpss**: ""*Just like with r/Intel and r/Nvidia, you don't need to even like Radeon products to join the discussion. It's just news and high effort text posts, mostly similar to other hardware discussion forums. Others have their niche and like then we have ours. The majority of our users do have a Radeon though, if the hardware survey is accurate.*""

####/r/saxophone 

**3770** *Saxophonists jamming* for **6 years!**

---

Welcome to /r/saxophone, a place for enthusiasts of the unique and beautiful instrument that is the sax.

Our sub tries to keep an interactive atmosphere by having community events, such as transcription challenges for users to participate in, as to display their tone and style. Whether its a kid asking what to add to his practice routine, or a mother asking what saxophone to buy for their child for Christmas, /r/saxophone always wants to help. We understand that passion is contagious, and by having a community of people that are excited to play their instrument, others may feel that same excitement.

Whether its a video of a solo from someones favorite saxophone player, or a picture of a vintage horn, people are always looking for things to share with the community. For example, frequent poster /u/Spamakin posted a guide to a [practicing technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/saxophone/comments/6kzptd/teacher_gave_me_a_good_long_tone_exercise_thought/) that his teacher showed him  with the intention of helping other saxophone players improve with this routine. It is great to know that there are communities like /r/saxophone full of people that are all interested in similar hobbies, and who want communicate and spread their interest to others.

####/r/AssPotatoCucumberDog

**5,267** weirdos for **1 year!**




&nbsp;


 

AssPotatoCucumberDog is a sub where the community can submit NSFW or SFW posts that include formats of variations of Asses, Potatoes, Cucumbers, and Dogs. The subreddit formed by a random redditor who put the words together in a comment chain as a funny joke. I saw it and created the subreddit. 




I wanted to the change that I seek. I’ve been banned from subreddits before. I saw this as an opportunity to try and make a subreddit, albiet obscure and funny subreddit, which does not ban anyone, ever. Thus, my most important rule is to never ban anyone from the sub for any reason. One mod who banned me once said “then make your own sub and dont ban people there.” So I did and here we are with the wonderfully confusing AssPotatoCucumberDog. Some posts are cute, some posts are uplifting, some posts are mean, some are WTF, some are fappening material, and some are ConfusedBoners. 

* Here are some links to some posts that I find exceptional: [potato christian book](https://i.redd.it/tqz3yffy9mdz.jpg)

>#**/u/ZadocPaet:** I have so many questions. First off, why?

>>**/u/ExpFilm_Student:** Well someone told me i should submit for subreddit of  the day. 

>>The reason why the sub was created is kind of funny. On a random comment chain many momth ago down the line of the chain people were posting subreddit names like a conversation. A random dude posted four random named togethher asspotatocucumberdog as a sub. But it wasnt a sub he just made it up to be funny. 

>>So i made it a sub. Created formats. Created some flair for peope to use. And have been promoting it since. It was a venue for me to be a mod with the goal of never banning anyone ever. I wanted a sub where i could mod and not ban people and i do that with this sub. I know its weird but somehow its worked. 


>#Aren't you just asking for someone to do something so awful it'll earn them a ban? 

>>No. I trust the community. Even if they did something awful i wouldnt ban them. The community is small right now so i havent had to worry. But most things i feel can be worked out in pm. Other things i let the community using voting to decide .

####/r/DeepPhilosophy

**637** of the deepest minds on reddit for **6 months!**


Here is a subreddit for parodying philosophy. The community engages in ridiculous thoughts about meaningless things or engages in debates about topics of zero importance. A question like, ""Is a hot-dog a sandwich?"" would be a major topic of discussion. We also enjoy jokes about philosophy or involving philosophers.

Some of our best thoughts and debates include the following:

>#[Would a giraffe wear a tie at the top or bottom of its neck?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepPhilosophy/comments/6g8cdt/would_a_giraffe_wear_a_tie_at_the_top_or_bottom/)

>>Definitely bottom.

>>We don't wear ties right below our chin, either. Just imagine the huge collar a giraffe's shirt would have if they wore a tie at the top!

>#[Deep Thought About Elbow Licking](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepPhilosophy/comments/6cihsn/deep_thought_about_elbow_licking/)

>>Have you ever realized that you're the only person in the entire world, who can't lick your elbow. Anyone else could, but you never will.


>#[Deep Thoughts About Cheese](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepPhilosophy/comments/6oq0dr/deep_thoughts_about_cheese/)

>>If you have some cheese with holes in it, one would assume that by having more cheese you would also have more holes. But, if you had more holes, you would also have less cheese.

>>So... the more cheese you have, the less cheese you have?

If you like arguing, but want to avoid controversial subjects like politics, come to r/DeepPhilosophy. There we can discuss the things that really matter like ambiguous food categorization and how animals would hypothetically wear clothing. If you constantly have thoughts of zero importance, we would love to see them.

####/r/catsandchristmastrees 

**1,539** cats and kittens *under the tree* for **1 year!**

I don't even remember how I found this subreddit. But when I did, my response was, ""of course that's a thing!"" After all, this is reddit, and we have 3267 communities dedicated to cats. The existence of this one doesn't surprise me. 

There's not a lot more to say about it, so why don't you just look at some of these posts?

####/r/ChristmasTrees 

**504** happy little trees for **5 years!**

Christmas trees say a lot about a person. Decorating a tree is a special way to celebrate the holiday season. From the type of tree, to the ornaments, the final product speaks volumes about those who put it all together. Also, they're pretty. 

/r/ChristmasTrees is a place where you can post your tree and see other pretty ones that are decorated by your fellow redditors. It doesn't even have to be your tree, it could just be one that you saw in person and snapped a pic of, or one that someone found on another sub and decided to crosspost it. 

Every November the sub ""lights up"" with activity, and it's alive right now. 

Here are some of this year's posts:

* [“Is your house on fire Clark”? - 9 foot tall 9600 LED lights.](https://i.redd.it/qy4rqpq6bu001.jpg)
* [Our teal, gold, and fuchsia tree. It’s a little crazy, but I’m pretty happy with the result.](https://i.redd.it/k2njp4we21001.jpg)
* [Baby with baby Christmas tree.](https://i.redd.it/v05ynmt02k001.jpg)
* [My first Christmas tree](https://i.redd.it/8kwnpf10czyz.jpg)

Come and post trees. And look at trees. And be merry.

**40,592** Humans *going harder, better, faster and stronger* for **8 years!**

Daft Punk is the masked electronic and house duo that has been rocking the world since 1993 and continues to do so even today. Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter became popular in the 90's with their inclusion in the French House Movement. /r/DaftPunk is like the Gift Shop that you visit on your way out from one of their live shows. 

/r/DaftPunk is the main discussion and sharing space for any and all things Daft Punk on reddit. [Got an awesome signed poster?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/5ugkjj/signed_alive_2007_poster_wstub/) [Did you meet the dynamic duo themselves?](http://i.imgur.com/OjRObJp.jpg) [Want to share some fanart?](https://i.redd.it/6oe6gvr1tlly.gif) The users of the community will be happy to accommodate you. The Moderators will be happy to assist you.

You will find that the userbase is just as keen to have a good time as you are and are always eager to jump into a conversation over anything Daft Punk related. And who can blame them? Animated Music Series, Grammy Award Winners, [Around The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yca6UsllwYs). Daft Punk simply gives you so much to talk about, and /r/DaftPunk is the place to do it.

Some of my personal favourite submissions to /r/DaftPunk are:

- [**That Hug!**](http://i.imgur.com/nrOkCho.jpg)

- [**Best Girlfriend Ever!...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/5k9vje/best_girlfriend_ever_she_had_this_custom_made_for/)

####/r/TokyoGhoul

**29,811** Doves *investigating* for **3 years!**

---

Tokyo Ghoul is a Dark Fantasy Seinen manga serialised in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump. The story takes place in an alternate reality in Tokyo where monsters that take the form of people prey upon human flesh. Events revolve around a young college student, Ken Kaneki, who is thrust between5 the two worlds of Human and Ghoul when he is involved in a freak accident, leading to his vital organs being replaced with those of a Ghoul. Kaneki subsequently becomes a 'One Eyed Ghoul' (Half-Human, Half-Ghoul) and must face his changing nature and new bloodthirsty desires head on among cataclysmic hostilities between the two races. 

If I were to describe /r/TokyoGhoul in a single word, I would call it *Shrewd*. A good deal of the community's user base can often be seen engaging in quirky theorising or getting in those juicy one-liners in every chapter thread (I know I do).  

The Community Moderators play an active role in the general way of life that /r/TokyoGhoul takes upon itself by always being around and posting alongside the non-staff users. Always quick to answer any queries and help out in any way they can. 

Negativity isn't much of an issue from what I have observed in my time with this community, as most people are very supportive of other's submissions and more often than not seem keen to launch into any Tokyo Ghoul related discussion. Every Monday (Or Sunday for some) is always one big hype train with everyone poised, ready for the next chapter. I hope to see this community grow even more with the inevitable influx of new fans with the upcoming third season for the anime in 2018.

Some of my personal favourite content this community has to offer is:

- [A Memorable Scene from a Different Angle...](/65lt7t/)

- [The best chapter in this whole series](/6c96yb/)

- [Some results of the Panel Colouring trend](/7d5d1w/)

---

*Some Moderators of /r/TokyoGhoul were happy to offer some input of their own:*

> **What has your experience with this community been like?**
>
>>**u/Nindzya -** Pretty great! The mods here are all very respectful and friendly with each other. We discuss almost EVERYTHING with each other - the little talks remind me of morning coffee. It's much more janitor focused (spam, fixing flair, fixing tags) than other subreddits, so we don't really need to deal with lots of negative users. I've been sent straight to the -100s for my opinions, but have only a select few times has mine or any of our status been called into question.
>
>>**u/TheMikarin -** Honestly stressful a lot of the time, but enjoyable too when I get to do things like make flairs for the community.
>
>
> **Do you have a favourite submission? If so, which one?**
>
>>**u/Nindzya -** One in particular. I'm not really a fan of theory posts which are really just baseless speculation or stretching to find meanings that aren't there for any fandom, but every fandom has one shining theory that stands above the rest and becomes headcanon for everyone. My favorite submission is from long ago that ended up being perfect. It's from way back when we were just a tiny little subreddit.
>
>>**https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/2gjabc/spoilerspierrot_tokyo_ghoul_ch_143_ending/**
>
>>**u/TheMikarin  -** 
**https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/3pbh6y/furuta_kijimas_assistant_and_rose_spoilers/**
>
>>This one is pretty memorable for me, given how accurate it turned out to be. Was shortly before the > actual reveal, but was pretty cool nonetheless.
>
> **What kind of content do you enjoy seeing the most?**
>
>>**u/Nindzya -**  Fan art and chapter discussions. I tend to vocally disagree with a lot of speculation that gets submitted and rank the series somewhat low (people here LOVE Tokyo Ghoul, it's insane!) so I'm viewed as a bit of a negative Nancy who hates everything, but I just want to have a good 15 minutes every Sunday and these kinds of posts are all about the fun.
>
>>**u/TheMikarin -** I generally really like seeing posts/comments about details like callbacks to events from earlier in the story, hints that we'd otherwise miss due to language differences, and other stuff like that. Aside from that, well thought out theories (ones that aren't reaching too much anyway), really cool fan art and unique cosplay are things that I love to see.
>
**What are your hopes for the future of this community?**
>
>>**u/Nindzya -** When our new wave of users come around for the new season I'm hoping our users become a bit more friendly rather than being so defensive in the face of criticism and slamming the downvotes. We try very hard to promote and open space and not be an echo chamber, we're slowly getting there.
>
>>**u/TheMikarin -** I hope more people will flair their posts and stop putting spoilers in titles by the time the :re anime comes, for now it's mostly just manga readers but by then we'll get lots of anime only newcomers, so it will be difficult for them to check the sub if spoilers aren't properly labelled or are plainly visible in titles. Really grateful to everyone who remembers to follow the rules and helps out by reminding others when they've forgotten to do so. Hope the community will be accessible and welcoming for all the newcomers from the :re anime.
>
**Are there any other points you would like to add?**
>
>>**u/Nindzya -** We have two very basic ideas that well describe our environment: be excellent to each other, and be passionate enough to put effort into your submissions. Many other fandoms are shitposts a plenty and can feel like white noise at times, so our subreddit is like a breath of fresh air. Our show just got a new season announced and the manga is in the most exciting arc yet nearing endgame, so now is a pretty great time to just catch up and join in on hype season.
>
>>**u/TheMikarin -** We'll eventually resume the Weekly Lax Threads, had to temporarily stop them due to issues with automod. Will add another batch of flairs some time, once we've gotten some more official art of newer characters. I'm somewhat hopeful that the :re anime will be good, but I'm at least happy that we'll likely get some decent :re merch from it.

####/r/FootballManagerGames


**40,528** subcribers for **7 years!**









**What's the sub about**

- /r/footballmanagergames is a catch-all subreddit for players who play the Football Manager series of games. If you want to share a cool story of a time you managed a team, then post it! If you want to show off a screenshot of your amazing player or great result, then post it! As long as it is about Football Manager, it belongs in our subreddit! We also host tournaments on the subreddit from time to time with the winners and runners up going in to a ""hall of fame"" in the subreddit's wiki.

**What kind of people are in the community**:

- We are very mixed in terms of age and location. It is hard to describe the community with a brief sentence or two, but I would personally describe us as a very relaxed community. There is no drama, we all just share a love of the game.

**Some links to good content**:

- Basically anything by /u/sonnorcteer. He has undertaken many great experiments using custom databases that all follow the premise of ""What if..."". Some of my favourites include, [""What if the league winners had to release their squad""](https://redd.it/6asfxh), [""What if the Premier League was like the NFL""](https://redd.it/6g3x7j), and, [""What if Barcelona and Real Madrid move to the MLS""](https://redd.it/5sth2z).

- [The millennial sim](https://redd.it/3fioa1). A user had the idea to simulate 1000 years in to the future on Football Manager 2015 to see what the footballing world might look like. He included dozens of screenshots as well as a spreadsheet that tallied up all of the trophies that each team had won. There is also the save file itself included, so you can download it and check it out for yourself. 

- [Memes are also acceptable](http://i.imgur.com/PkIuJMC.png).

- [A guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/5vwoan/youth_development_guide/) on how to develop youth players.

- [DoctorBenjy's AMA](https://redd.it/6uo921). One of the most popular FM YouTubers agreed to do an AMA on the subreddit. 

- [Our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/wiki/index) is also choc full of stuff for you to read through. It also includes a semi-regularly updated list of the most popular Football Manager YouTubers.

#### /r/WhatAMoron


**15,150** subscribers for **1 month**





/r/WhatAMoron is a collaboration sub of all the injury and stupid networks of reddit. It is not necessarily just injuries like other subs, it literally is a sub that makes you instantly think ""What A Moron"" as a reaction to these said posts.

We are a small subreddit (just a little over 1500 users which we refer to the intelligent specimens) which I really want to grow and as an incentive, there are gold giveaways on it for people who spread the word (within reddit's rules and regulations of course) or post/crosspost to it with relatable content. Our one main rule is that accidental injuries (that are unavoidable) posts are not moronic and are not allowed.

[Our top post which actually gave us most of our subscribers is a great example of an injury.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatAMoron/comments/7c8pfo/time_to_breach_elevator_doors_with_force/)

[Here's a great example of a non-injury from one of our top posters](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatAMoron/comments/7bor3k/lpt_dont_threaten_airlines/) by /u/debate_irl

The general idea is to allow everyone interested in seeing stupid people in society all in one sub and not in several different subs.

####/r/tf2 


**182,576** Mercenary's for  **9 Years!**

Team Fortress 2 is a [timeless masterpiece](https://youtu.be/KuqImZKygvw) and so is the subreddit for it! No matter how bad the time was, this subreddit held through it.

It has everything, [discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7e85xd/competitive_banter_saturdaysmondays_edition_91/), [rl recreations of weapons](https://reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7ewrsq/i_built_a_pair_of_ambassador_revolvers_one_of/), [art](https://reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7ezx7v/my_first_shot_at_sss_kinda_pleased_with_it_i_guess/) and even [memes](https://nm.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/79f3el/this_is_the_idea_soldier_loadout_you_may_not_like/) (a lot of 'em). And this mixture makes this place so amazing - The tf2 community is amazing and very active, even if the game is already 10 years old. Why, you may ask? Well, it's simple - The game is special - It has a lot of character and is something you can always come back to! No matter if you quit the game 1 month or 5 years ago, you'll still love the game. 

This community keeps this game fun and whenever I see a post of /r/tf2 in my timeline I'm happy to be a part of the community. Another thing that is completely unique to this community (if you compare it to some other similar games) is that it isn't toxic - /r/tf2 is a peaceful place where everyone just shows their love for this game. There is nothing toxic there because the game is the definition of a fun and rewarding game. Some people point that to its casual roots, and while I can agree that it's so much fun to play this game casually, [I don't think that is really true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3cCr-1UPaU). The community shows a huge interest in competitive, and we have some amazing players with unbelievable good skill. 

I recommend /r/tf2 to anyone that loves team shooters or just a funny community to relax after a hard day of work!

####/r/Engrish 

**59,190** subscribers for **9 years**

r/engrish is a relatively large subreddit I stumbled upon one day through a random button spree. The premise is that you submit anything that was poorly written, or as the sidebar says, ""an engrish phuck-up"". I was attracted because of all the hilarious content that makes it onto that subreddit.



In this subreddit, you can find anything from a poorly made translation to a bad grammatical effort from someone who speaks English. The funny part is that these kinds of events are quite common in real life, so the subreddit is always filling up with interesting content. The moderators have done a great job in growing the subreddit into a brilliant community that barely needs moderation at all.

Have you noticed highly inappropriate videos on youtube for kids? Well, /r/ElsaGate tries to raise awareness about the recent trend of absurd, sexualised, violent or otherwise abusive content found on youtube & youtube kids. Often featuring children favourites like Elsa or Spider-Man, these videos can take the form of live-action, claymation, or copy-cat animations, and are disguised under terms like ""Learn Colors"", ""Nursery Rhymes"" and clickbait titles.

"November 28th, 2017 - /r/DemocracyExperiment: Where Users Decide The Rules And Content Through Direct Democracy.",200,7g3yza,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/7g3yza/november_28th_2017_rdemocracyexperiment_where/,13,"### /r/DemocracyExperiment



**267** Citizens for **2 months**!


&nbsp;



Founded 2 months ago, /r/DemocracyExperiment is a unique subreddit where the users decide the rules, leaders and content through the form of a direct democracy.



Users can submit propositions, amendments or repeal and the subreddit members can vote ""Aye"" or ""Nay"". Simply, if more ""Aye"" votes are gained than ""Nay"" votes the proposition passes and is added to the list of laws. They can also create discussion threads around these laws, meta posts concerning the subreddit, media relating to the laws that have been passed and anything else related.


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


Currently, there have been 81 propositions (which can all be found in the [wiki] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyExperiment/wiki/index)), of which 57 of those have been passed into law. [Political parties] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyExperiment/comments/76r9pe/proposal_parties/) (which have their own private subreddits), a [court] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyExperiment/comments/75am9f/proposal_create_a_court_of_rdemocracyexperiment/), a [discord server] (https://discord.gg/sAxV46b) and a [secret service] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyExperiment/comments/7aqi9j/proposal_secret_service/) have all sprung from these propositions. One can also find weekly discussion threads concerning real-life politics, with civil and interesting debate going on there.


&nbsp;



The best thing about this subreddit is that all of the above was possible only because the users made it possible. The 10 core laws were the only original features, rules and propositions this subreddit had, however over time the users have helped steer its course to what is there today. Rather than it being a team of a few users deciding how the subreddit is run, everybody has equal say; leading to a truly intriguing course of events.

**81,954**  Leser for  **11 Years!**   

Reddit is 99 percent in English and here is where /r/de comes in - /r/de is (as the name implies) a Subreddit dedicated to Germany. They have German memes, German discussions and even English memes about Germany. They are known for their MaiMai's and [takeover of /r/France](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62s6kp/germany_are_trying_to_take_over_france_again/) back when we had /r/place (One of the most interesting things that happened there). And yes, /r/France and /r/de are often attacking each other. Be it by [""a fight for their ""Mittwochs-frosch""""](https://i.imgur.com/OpYOhm3.png) or just joking about each other.

But MaiMai's are not the only thing that this sub has to offer, they have [super long rants, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/7bogy4/miesgelaunte_mitb%C3%BCrger_die_einfach_nicht_ihre/) like we Germans love to do, [jokes](https://i.imgur.com/FoAAX6j.jpg) on our language, discussions about [politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/7dtlie/ernennung_neuer_bundesrichter_wie_trump_amerikas/) or just [random things, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/7dtybm/kann_ich_meine_f%C3%BC%C3%9Fe_wenn_sie_kalt_sind_auch_mit/) [jokes](https://i.imgur.com/Z4H5VCp.png) about weird people,
 and even [pictures](https://i.redd.it/9em9eal1xjyz.jpg) about things they found funny.

*Now for some questions I asked the mods of /r/de:*^^Huge ^^thanks ^^for ^^their ^^support ^^here ^^:)

 >  1.If you had to choose one thing that made this sub special, what would it be?

 >> **/u/sdfghs**: ""The thing that makes this subreddit special is the combination of humorous posts and memes with news concerning Germany and other German speaking countries. Also in comparision with other national subreddits we are able to avoid messages by tourists or people who want to become German as their ancestors 300 years ago were German through /r/germany""

> 2.Do you think you need to speak German to visit this sub?

>> **/u/sdfghs**:  ""It is not necessary to be able to speak German to visit this subreddit, but a basic knowledge of German is of course really useful.""

> 3.What are the biggest highlights you would want to show to other people from /r/de?

>> **/u/sdfghs**: ""One personal highlight for me was when one member of our community was able to avoid a potential mass shooting by contacting the police. Other than that most of the posts on /r/de/top can summarise the great achievments of our subreddit""


I would recommend /r/de to those who are German or trying to learn the language.

**1,096** political revolutionaries for **2 years!**


[Geosim](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/new/) is a subreddit where you claim a nation (map of claimed and unclaimed nations [here](https://i.imgur.com/y50IneT.png)) and then simulate its role in international politics. Geosim manages to walk the fine line where the content is realistic, but not too realistic as not to be fun. 

Take the role of a country and play it to the best of your ability. Improve the economy, raise education standards, and much, much more, it’s all up to what you want to do. 

You can choose to just follow the most realistic course, or instead go on a somewhat darker path, raising nationalism and installing a dictator. You can also work together with other countries. This collaboration between players can be military alliances or simple trade deals. 

Of course, politics isn’t politics without an ability to exert power, and you have complete control of your military to do just that. However, to implement your will on others through force, you do need a casus belli or reason to go to war. Moderators also decide the outcomes of conflict. Firstly, some logistics so this makes sense. Geosim has a functioning economic system - monitored by the moderators - to ensure some realism and a desire for a thriving economy. 

In addition to this, Geosim functions with an accelerated time passage with one week in real life being the equivalent of one year in Geosim. The moderators make sure that everything goes smoothly, help spice things up with Mod Events and also keep things realistic. 

The player base in Geosim is wildly varied, with people coming from backgrounds of politics, law and economics, however the only thing required is a desire to have fun. There is a large community of players willing to help each other out who often provide advice and tips. The moderation team is also awesome and help everyone get the most out of the experience. 

Due to the nature of Geosim being a ‘game’ that progresses, content changes rapidly depending on how advanced we are into the season.

This is a perfect place for you to enact your wild fantasies of world conquest and an exemplary place to release the inner politician, general or economist. As the season draws to a close, world tensions are rising, especially between India and China ~~and WWIII is probably not far off~~. 

Finally, this is just a great place to have some fun. With friendly and helpful moderators and fellow players, the community is supportive and helpful. What are you waiting for? Why not make a [claim post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/submit?sidebar&title=%5BClaim%5D) and join in now?

New season starts today!

***6,696*** Disney Giffers for ***5 years***


r/disneygifs is a community that existed since 2012, but lay bare for a while. In September 2017 it was revived and grew slowly and steadily to almost 7,000 users.

We've had a CSS overhaul, have **daily content** and a small, but fine community.

&nbsp;

As the title suggests it's a place for gifs. **Disney gifs**. And **Pixar gifs**.

Imagine a friend tells you *""...and then we stayed in for the weekend and watched a couple of Disney movies.""* Most of us probably associate that with movies like *The Lion King*, *Frozen* and *Finding Nemo* or maybe even the live action Disneys like *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea* or *Flight of the Navigator*. 

Those are the gifs this sub is about. We know that there are already hundreds of them out in the wild just waiting to be posted AND we also have a lot of Original Content (OC) of all sorts.

Like [this gif](https://i.imgur.com/BaV10hU.gifv) that started the revival.

&nbsp; 

We have:

* [classic reaction gifs](https://i.imgur.com/k2MG6ZZ.gifv)
* [the occasional meta gif](https://i.imgur.com/cRnkIjV.gifv)
* [gifs with the original text](https://i.imgur.com/CbKA5ww.gifv)
* [dubbed gifs](https://gfycat.com/SpiffyElatedKoi)
* [silly gifs](https://media.giphy.com/media/szluU4BRyID4c/giphy.gif)
* and many more...

&nbsp;

So all in all, if you like Disney or Pixar gifs, if you like watching them, posting them, maybe even making them, this sub is for you!
